# The Theological Correction: A Comprehensive Analysis of Disney's *Snow White* (2025) as Restoration of the Vertical

## I. Introduction: The Schism of Spiritual Physics in the Centennial Era

The year 2023 marked the centennial of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, a cultural institution that has arguably served as the primary myth-maker for the Western world in the 20th and 21st centuries. Throughout its history, the studio's output has operated on a fundamental, almost metaphysical premise: that the internal world of emotion, intent, and character can be—and indeed must be—externalized into the visible world of form, movement, and environment. This premise, whether utilized intuitively by animators or consciously by storytellers, established a structural isomorphism with the theological system of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), specifically his **Doctrine of Correspondences**, which posits that natural forms are the "ultimate" effects of spiritual causes.

For decades, this "language of nature" remained consistent. A storm in *The Little Mermaid* was not merely a meteorological event but the externalized fury of a sea king; the wilting rose in *Beauty and the Beast* was not a botanical anomaly but a chronometer of the soul's potential for regeneration. The animation medium itself, by its very nature, demanded a "physics of the soul" where gravity, light, and color obeyed the emotional and moral logic of the scene rather than the laws of Newtonian mechanics. This artistic necessity aligned the medium perfectly with Swedenborg's vision of a plastic, responsive spiritual world where affections manifest visibly as animals and landscapes shift instantaneously to reflect the interior state of the inhabitants.

However, the release of the animated feature *Wish* (2023) and the live-action adaptation of *Snow White* (2025) reveals a profound schism in this metaphysical tradition. While *Wish*, intended as a tribute to the studio's legacy, has been critiqued for performing a "theological inversion" or "profanation" of these principles, analysis of the live-action *Snow White* indicates a surprising fidelity to the structural dynamics of Swedenborgian regeneration. This divergence presents a paradox: the film explicitly designed to celebrate the "magic" of the studio (*Wish*) appears to have hollowed out that magic by severing its vertical connection to the Divine, while the film most criticized for its "modern sensibilities" and departure from tradition (*Snow White*) has inadvertently reinforced the deep theological structures of the original fairy tale.

This analysis undertakes an exhaustive investigation into this divergence. It posits that *Wish* represents a shift from "Universal Correspondence" to "Cultural Metaphor" and Gnostic self-deification, effectively severing the link to the "Spiritual Sun." Conversely, the live-action *Snow White*—through its specific reinvention of characters like **Jonathan**, its handling of the **Magic Mirror**, its "Apple Orchard" backstory, and its musical score—inadvertently reconstructs a rigorous Swedenborgian drama regarding the destruction of the **Proprium** (selfhood) and the restoration of the "State of the Church." By applying the forensic tools of Swedenborgian exegesis—specifically the doctrines of **Influx**, **Vastation**, and **Use**—this analysis will demonstrate why the "modernized" live-action film may be spiritually more "traditional" than the studio's animated centennial celebration.

## II. Theoretical Framework: The Swedenborgian Substrate

To understand the magnitude of the divergence between *Wish* and *Snow White* (2025), one must first establish the "active substrate" of Swedenborgian thought that historically underpinned the Disney universe. This was not merely a stylistic choice but an operational philosophy that governed the "physics" of the animated world.

### 2.1 The Doctrine of Influx and the Illusion of Life

The core of Swedenborgian cosmology is the **Doctrine of Influx**. Reality is stratified into discrete degrees: the Celestial (Love), the Spiritual (Wisdom), and the Natural (Action). A fundamental tenet of this system is that life does not originate in the natural world; it flows into it from the Lord, who is the "Spiritual Sun." Forms in the natural world—whether human bodies, animals, or trees—are merely "receptacles" of this life. They do not generate life; they receive it.

In the "Golden Age" of Disney animation (e.g., *Pinocchio*, *Snow White* 1937) and the "Renaissance" (e.g., *The Lion King*, *Beauty and the Beast*), this doctrine was secularized as the artistic principle of "Inner Force driving Outer Form." Animators were taught that a character's movement (natural effect) must be driven by an internal intent or emotion (spiritual cause). If a character moved without this internal motivation, it was dismissed as "rubber hose" animation—mechanical, lifeless, and devoid of soul. This pedagogical mandate created a universe where the physical world was transparent to the spiritual.

### 2.2 The Proprium and the Problem of Self

The central antagonist in Swedenborgian theology is the **Proprium**—the "ownhood" or "selfhood" of man. It is the vivid sensation that we live, think, and act from ourselves. When the Proprium confirms itself as the source of life, it becomes the "Love of Self" (*Amor Sui*), which is the root of all evil and the essence of Hell.

The Proprium operates as a closed loop. It constantly seeks confirmation of its own existence, drawing all things toward itself as center. It cannot receive influx from the Divine because it has positioned itself *as* the source. This creates a spiritual "black hole"—a vacuum that appears to have substance but is, in reality, empty of all life and truth.

### 2.3 The True Wish vs. The False Wish

At the heart of this investigation lies a critical distinction: **The True Wish versus The False Wish**.

| Dimension | The True Wish | The False Wish |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Source** | Received (from the Divine, through prayer) | Self-Generated (from the Proprium) |
| **Direction** | Vertical (up/down between degrees) | Horizontal (within the natural plane) |
| **Object** | The Good of Others / Conjunction with the Divine | Self-aggrandizement / Control |
| **Mechanism** | Influx (life flows *through* the vessel) | Closure (life is claimed *by* the vessel) |
| **Outcome** | Regeneration / Heaven | Vastation / Hell |
| **Disney Expression** | "I'm Wishing" (prayer) / "Waiting on a Wish" | "I'm a Star" (Stardust) / Wish Orbs |

A "true wish," in this framework, is fundamentally a prayer—a desire directed toward the Divine, seeking alignment with the Divine Will. It opens the soul to receive influx from above. A "false wish," by contrast, is a desire originating in the Proprium, seeking to confirm the self as the source of good. It closes the soul into a loop of self-reference.

### 2.4 The "Fisher King" and the Moral Mirror

This substrate manifested most clearly in the "Fisher King" archetype, which correlates with Swedenborg's correspondence of the **Land** (Earth) with the **State of the Church**. In Swedenborg's exegesis, the physical state of the land in biblical prophecy—whether it is blooming, drought-stricken, or frozen—is never a description of agriculture but a precise diagnosis of the spiritual state of the people.

Disney films replicate this diagnostic topography with high fidelity. In *The Lion King*, the reign of Mufasa (Divine Truth/Law) maintains the "Circle of Life" (Divine Order), resulting in a lush kingdom. When Scar (Self-Love/Falsity) usurps the throne, the transformation of the landscape is immediate and total. The sun is obscured, the water (Truth) dries up, and the land becomes a skeletal wasteland. This is a perfect depiction of "Vastation"—the spiritual desolation that occurs when the connection to the Divine is severed by the rule of the Proprium.

## III. The Anatomy of the False Wish: *Wish* as Gnostic Inversion

The film *Wish* (2023) serves as the primary case study for the abandonment or inversion of this system. Intended as a centennial celebration of the studio's history of "wishing upon a star," the theological mechanics it establishes represent a radical departure from the studio's historical metaphysics, effectively "profaning" the very tradition it seeks to honor.

### 3.1 The Star as "Stardust": Immanence vs. Transcendence

In the classic Disney canon, exemplified by *Pinocchio* (1940), the "wish" is a prayer directed upward to a transcendent source (the Blue Star/Blue Fairy). The puppet Pinocchio is "empty" and must earn his soul through moral regeneration ("brave, truthful, and unselfish"). This aligns with Swedenborg's view that the human proprium (self) is lifeless until animated by Divine Influx. The source of life is external and superior to the vessel.

In *Wish*, this cosmology is inverted. The song "I'm a Star" explicitly teaches that "we are our own origin story" and that the divine spark is inherent in the material constitution of the characters ("stardust"). This is a **Gnostic** or **Pantheistic** framework where the divine is trapped in matter, rather than a **Theistic** framework where life flows *into* matter from a higher degree.

The implication of this shift is profound. It collapses the "Vertical Causality" of Swedenborg into a "Horizontal" plane. There is no need for regeneration, repentance, or influx from the Lord because the self is already divine. Swedenborg defines the belief that "nature is the source of life" or that "man is God" as the fundamental falsity of the **Proprium** (Self-Love). By celebrating the self as the source of magic, *Wish* inadvertently celebrates the very force (Proprium) that acts as the antagonist in Swedenborg's theology.

### 3.2 The Wish Orb: The Externalization of the Ruling Love

The film introduces the concept of the "Wish Orb," a physical sphere containing a person's greatest desire. King Magnifico extracts these orbs and keeps them in his castle for "safekeeping," causing the citizens to forget their wishes and live in a state of docile contentment.

In Swedenborgian psychology, every being is defined by a "Ruling Love" (Dominant Love). This is the gravitational center of the soul. All thoughts, actions, and memories organize themselves around this core desire. If the ruling love is removed, the person effectively ceases to exist or becomes a "spiritual zombie" until it is restored.

By treating the Ruling Love as an external object that can be given away, stored, or shattered, *Wish* commodifies the spiritual essence. In Swedenborg's system, the Ruling Love *is* the life of the person; it cannot be extracted without death. The film's mechanic suggests that the soul is a possession one *has*, rather than what one *is*.

Furthermore, King Magnifico is described as a "False God" who demands worship in exchange for the "protection" of these wishes. This mirrors Swedenborg's description of **Babylon**—the profanation of good and truth for the sake of dominion. However, the film's solution to this tyranny is not to restore the wishes to a higher order (Divine Will) but to return them to the "self," reinforcing the closed loop of the Proprium.

### 3.3 The "Hollow" State and the Closed Loop

Critics and analysts have frequently noted that *Wish* feels "hollow" or lacks the emotional weight of earlier films. From a Swedenborgian perspective, this is the inevitable result of the **"Closed Loop of Self-Reference"**.

The mechanism of "Universal Correspondence" relies on the influx of the Infinite (the Divine) into the Finite (the Natural). This creates a sense of depth, mystery, and life. When the "vertical" connection to the Divine is severed in favor of the "self" (which is finite and dead in itself), the artistic product loses its "soul." It mimics the *forms* of correspondence—talking animals, magic sparks, musical numbers—but lacks the *influx* that gives them life. The Star in *Wish* is not a messenger of Divine Providence; it is a "mascot" or a reflection of Asha's own ego.

This reliance on "Cultural Metaphor" (horizontal references to Disney history) rather than "Universal Correspondence" creates a simulacrum of magic. The film references *Peter Pan*, *Bambi*, and *Snow White*, but these are Easter eggs (surface data) rather than spiritual resonances. The result is a "Kingdom of Self," where the universe exists only to validate the ego's desires, a state Swedenborg identifies with the "Love of the World" separated from the "Love of Heaven."

## IV. The Apple Orchard and Jonathan: Production Theology in *Snow White* (2025)

In stark contrast to the "self-deification" of *Wish*, the 2025 live-action *Snow White* appears to reconstruct the rigorous moral and spiritual architecture of Swedenborg's universe. Despite modernizing elements—such as the removal of the Prince Charming archetype and the introduction of a new character named Jonathan—the film's plot mechanics, specifically regarding the **Mirror**, the **Queen**, the **Apple**, and the **Land**, align with the "Science of Correspondences" with high fidelity.

### 4.1 The "Johnny Appleseed" Backstory and the Doctrine of Use

In the 2025 film, Snow White is given a specific backstory: her father, the Good King, owned an apple orchard, where she worked alongside him, picking apples and baking pies to distribute to the peasants of the kingdom. This "origin story" for Snow White—linking her foundational memories to an apple orchard—is striking in light of the "Johnny Appleseed" segment of *Melody Time* (1948), one of the most explicitly Swedenborgian texts in the Disney canon.

As detailed in companion documents, the "Johnny Appleseed" segment establishes:

1. **The Source of Blessing:** Johnny's "Blessings Three" are "Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree"—not personal ambition but the gifts of Divine Providence.
2. **The Method of Use:** Johnny's purpose is to plant apple trees to "give" to others. He is a vessel of Use.
3. **The Definition of Luxury:** Johnny explicitly rejects comfort ("Who needs a roof?") in favor of service, aligning with the Swedenborgian rejection of the "Love of the World."

Snow White's backstory in the 2025 film mirrors this structure:

1. **The Source of Blessing:** The "good old days" of the orchard are associated with her father—an absent Divine source.
2. **The Method of Use:** The method of this alignment is *work*. "We'd pick apples... make pies... go out." This is active charity. She is not sitting in the castle wishing; she is in the orchard working.
3. **The Definition of Luxury:** The Queen calls the pies "luxuries" that "confuse" the peasants. This reveals the Queen's spiritual state. To the "natural man" (the Queen), spiritual goods (charity/pies) are useless luxuries. To the "spiritual man" (Snow White), they are essential sustenance.

### 4.2 The Theological Correction of the Apple

By giving Snow White this specific backstory, the filmmakers have effectively realigned her "ruling love" with the Doctrine of Use. In Swedenborgian correspondence, the "Apple" (and fruit trees generally) signifies the "Good of Life" or "Works of Charity" derived from Truth.

* **The Queen's Apples:** The Evil Queen uses the apple as a vessel for death (poison). This represents the **Profanation of Use**—using the appearance of a good thing (a beautiful red apple) to destroy the soul. It is "faith separate from charity," or knowledge used for evil ends.
* **Snow White's Apples:** Snow White uses the apple as a vessel for nourishment (pie/charity). This represents the **True Use** of goods.

By linking Snow White to the apple *before* the poisoning (a change from the 1937 original), the film reclaims the symbol of the apple from the Fall (Eve) and realigns it with Redemption (Johnny Appleseed/Charity). This is a theological correction that posits "Good Works" (baking pies) as the foundation of the character's strength. Snow White is not "fairest" merely because she is beautiful; she is "fairest" because she is *useful*. She feeds the village. She manifests her internal love in external works.

### 4.3 Jonathan: The "God-Given" Truth of Doctrine

One of the most controversial decisions in the 2025 production was the replacement of the traditional "Prince" with a new character named "Jonathan," described as a bandit or a Robin Hood-like figure. Critics initially viewed this as a concession to modern feminism or a rejection of the romance trope. However, a structural analysis reveals a profound theological logic behind this specific nomenclature and characterization.

#### 4.3.1 The Etymology and Archetype

The name "Jonathan" is Hebrew (*Yehonatan*), meaning "Yahweh has given" or "God-given." In Swedenborgian exegesis, names in sacred texts (and by extension, in correspondential narratives) are never arbitrary; they signify the "quality" or "essence" of the character. The choice of "Jonathan"—a specifically biblical name—over a generic European royal name (like Florian or Henri) signals a shift in the character's function.

In the Bible, Jonathan is the son of King Saul (the corrupt, external ruler) but the sworn friend and ally of David (the true, spiritual king). Swedenborg analyzes the biblical Jonathan as representing the "Truth of Doctrine" or the "External Truth protecting the Church." He acts as a medium or a bridge. In the 2025 film, the kingdom is ruled by the Evil Queen (a Saul figure/Usurper). Snow White represents the "Church" or the "Soul" in exile. Jonathan, introduced as a "bandit" operating outside the Queen's law, represents "Truth" that has been alienated from the ruling structure but remains loyal to the true order.

#### 4.3.2 The "Thief" Correspondence and the Spoliation of the Egyptians

Jonathan is explicitly described as a thief who steals from the Queen to feed the poor. In Swedenborgian symbolism, "thieves" generally have a negative correspondence (appropriating the Lord's merit). However, in the context of "saving the remains" (the poor/the good) from a "profane dominion" (the Queen), this action corresponds to the "Spoliation of the Egyptians"—the reclaiming of truths and goods that have been captured by evil.

Jonathan enters the "closed" system of the Queen's tyranny to introduce a new element of hope, functioning as a disruptive force of truth in a kingdom of falsity. This characterization fundamentally alters the dynamic of salvation. Jonathan's role is to facilitate Snow White's agency, not to save her passively. This aligns with the Swedenborgian concept of "Cooperation." The soul (Snow White/Will) cannot be saved by "Faith Alone" (passive belief in a Prince). It must cooperate with "Truth" (Jonathan/Understanding) to fight against the Proprium.

### 4.4 The Visual Homage to Mary Blair

The visual realization of the apple orchard scenes supports the "Johnny Appleseed" connection. Production notes and reviews describe the orchard scenes as stylized, with "drifts of pure white snow in an apple orchard" and vibrant colors that contrast with the "drab" or "garish" tones of the Queen's castle. This aesthetic evokes the work of Mary Blair, particularly her concept art for *Melody Time* (1948) and the *Johnny Appleseed* segment.

Mary Blair's style, characterized by "flatness" and "color as emotion," is a visual application of Swedenborgian aesthetics—seeing the spiritual in the natural, rather than the natural as a separate solid. By invoking this specific visual language for the orchard sequence, director Marc Webb and the production design team are visually citing the era of the studio where Swedenborgian influence was most explicit. The orchard is not just a location; it is a "sacred space" of memory and innocence, distinct from the "Vastated" landscape of the Queen's castle.

The film's use of color adheres to the "Correspondence of Colors":

* **Snow White:** Primary colors (Blue/Red/Yellow). Blue corresponds to Truth, Red to Love/Charity, Yellow/Gold to Goodness. She is the integrated soul.
* **The Queen:** Purple, Black, and Cold tones. Purple corresponds to the "Love of Dominion" (royal power abused). Black corresponds to falsity and the void.
* **The Orchard:** Described in reviews as having a specific, almost "fake" or "video game cutscene" quality. While intended as a criticism, this "unreality" aligns with Blair's rejection of realism in favor of "emotional truth." The orchard is a spiritual memory, not a geographical location.

## V. "Waiting on a Wish": Lyrical Exegesis and the Rejection of Gnostic Self-Deification

The most direct evidence for the theological coherence of *Snow White* (2025) is found in its central musical number, "Waiting on a Wish," written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Where *Wish* offered the anthem "I'm a Star" as its statement of origin, *Snow White* offers a counter-thesis that operates as a deliberate rejection of the Gnostic model and an affirmation of the Vertical.

### 5.1 Verse-by-Verse Analysis

#### Verse 1: The Prayer Posture

> *They say somewhere there's a star so bright / That anything it touches turns to light / That everything will change, they say, if I just send my heart up for the night*

This opening establishes the **prayer posture**—the soul directing its desire *upward* ("up for the night") toward a transcendent source ("a star so bright"). The mechanism is clear: blessing does not originate in the self but is received from above. The star is not intrinsic stardust (as in *Wish*); it is an external source of light, and "anything it touches" is transformed *by* that light, not by its own inherent divinity. This is the precise inversion of *Wish*'s "I'm a Star."

#### Verse 2: The Desire for Use

> *So I wish to give someone a hand / I wish to learn to be my father's daughter / Wish I'll start speaking with a fearless heart / I'm looking to the sky, and now I'm making a start*

Snow White's wish is not for personal power or recognition. It is:
1. **"To give someone a hand"** — The Doctrine of Use. She wishes to *serve*.
2. **"To learn to be my father's daughter"** — **Conjunction with the Divine Good** (The Father). This is the alignment of the Will with the Divine Will. She is not seeking autonomy; she is seeking alignment. She wants to be *formed by* her origin, not to *replace* it.
3. **"A fearless heart"** — The activation of the Will (Heart) by Divine Truth. Courage is not self-generated; it is the result of alignment with the Vertical.

The posture is *receptive* ("looking to the sky") but also *active* ("making a start"). This is Swedenborg's "as-if-from-self" principle: the regenerating soul must *act* as if from itself, while acknowledging that the power to act comes from the Lord.

#### Verse 3: The Critique of Self-Sufficiency

> *Everybody says there's never enough / That life is hard and love is tough / But I've seen someone who has barely anything be happy just because*

This verse contains a subtle critique of the **Proprium's** scarcity mindset ("never enough"). The Proprium hoards because it believes itself to be the source and the center. It fears loss because it has no influx from above. Snow White, by contrast, has observed that one can be happy "with barely anything"—a state impossible for the Proprium to comprehend. This is the state of **heavenly peace** (contentment from the Lord), which Swedenborg contrasts with the **worldly anxiety** of those ruled by self-love.

#### Verse 4: The "More" of the Proprium vs. the "Enough" of Influx

> *And I could wish for something more / But more has never mattered like before / And isn't love itself enough to make you wish for more to give?*

This verse directly confronts the logic of *Wish*. In *Wish*, Asha is taught to desire her "orb" back—to want *more* for herself. Snow White here explicitly rejects this logic: "More has never mattered like before."

Instead, she reframes the "more": *"Isn't love itself enough to make you wish for **more to give**?"* This is the crucial theological pivot. The "wish" is not for more *receiving* but for more *giving*. This is the Doctrine of Use operating at the level of the Will. The regenerate soul does not desire to consume; it desires to contribute. The influx of Divine Love creates a spontaneous desire to *be useful to others*, not to accumulate for the self.

#### The Bridge: The Explicit Echo Rejection

> *They say, "All you have to do / To make your wish come true / Is let it echo"*  
> *Well, I can hear the echo loud and clear / But I'm still waiting here*

This is the most theologically loaded passage of the song. The "they" refers to the conventional Disney wisdom: "When you wish upon a star... makes no difference who you are... your dreams come true." In *Wish*, this is literalized: Asha's wishes are amplified by the Star mascot and the "echo" of the community singing with her. The power of the wish is directly proportional to its volume—a horizontal, democratic amplification.

Snow White **explicitly rejects this mechanism**. She can "hear the echo loud and clear"—she is aware of the cultural script that tells her wishing will be enough—"But I'm still waiting here." The echo is *not working*. This is a direct admission that the horizontal mechanism of self-amplification (the core theology of *Wish*) is insufficient. The wish requires something else: a response from *above*, not from within.

This is not passive despair; it is **theologically correct patience**. She is waiting for influx from the Vertical, which cannot be commanded by the loudness of the Horizontal echo. This posture is faith, not "faith alone" (passive) but "faith that waits" (receptive).

#### Final Verse: The Humble Self vs. The Stellar Self

> *Maybe I could finally become / Someone who just might be brave / Someone no one needs to save*

The final verse establishes Snow White's goal: to become "someone no one needs to save." This is the opposite of the 1937 model (passive faith requiring a Prince) but *also* the opposite of the *Wish* model (self-deification requiring no external source).

Snow White does not say "I am already brave" or "I have the power within me." She says "**Maybe** I could **finally become** someone..." This is the language of regeneration—a process of becoming, not a pre-existing state. Swedenborg describes regeneration as a gradual transformation where the Lord remakes the person's interiors over time. It is not instant, and it is not self-generated.

### 5.2 The Structural Mechanics of Restoration

In addition to the lyrical content, the filmmakers introduced several narrative elements that reinforce the Swedenborgian structure:

#### The "Father's Daughter" Motif

Snow White explicitly seeks to be her "father's daughter," to return to the orchard, and to restore the kingdom to its former state. This longing for a lost "Golden Age" aligned with a benevolent Ruler/Father corresponds directly to the Swedenborgian concept of the **"Most Ancient Church"** and the "Heavenly State" before the Fall. The Father is not present in the film's action but is the absent source of all that is good. This is theologically correct: the Divine (Father) does not appear *as* a character competing with other characters; the Divine is the *source* from which all goods flow and the *standard* by which all evils are measured.

#### The Environment as Spiritual Barometer (Vastation and Restoration)

The live-action film retains the Swedenborgian "Fisher King" dynamic with striking clarity. Under the Evil Queen, the kingdom is described as having "pale light," "hues turning pale," and farmers conscripted into soldiers. This is **spiritual vastation**—the draining of "Charity" (color/life) and "Peace" (farmers) by the "Love of Dominion" (soldiers/tyranny).

The restoration is instantaneous. When the Mirror is broken and the Queen consumed, the kingdom "goes back to the way it once was," and everyone celebrates. This immediate restoration of the environment upon the removal of the ruling evil is a textbook example of Swedenborgian **Influx** returning to its proper order. The block (Proprium) is removed, and Divine Life flows in again, healing the land.

---

## VI. The Mirror and the Queen's Destruction: Judgment and the Void

The central visual and narrative innovation of the 2025 film is its treatment of the Magic Mirror. Where the 1937 version presented the Mirror as a passive revealer of truth, the 2025 version elevates it to a site of judgment and, ultimately, consumption.

### 6.1 The Mirror as the Proprium and the Void

In the 2025 film, the Evil Queen's relationship with the Magic Mirror is central to the spiritual dynamics. The mirror represents the **Self-Reflection of the Proprium**. The Queen gazes into it not to seek truth, but to confirm her own superiority ("fairest of all"). It is a closed loop of vanity.

The climax of the film involves the Queen destroying the Mirror. This act is pivotal. Shattering the mirror creates a "rift into a netherspace" that consumes her. She turns to ash and is sucked into this void.

This imagery is strikingly Swedenborgian. Swedenborg describes Hell not as a place of external punishment (fire and pitchforks), but as a state where the internal is a "void" or "abyss" because it is emptied of truths and goods. The "netherspace" behind the mirror corresponds to the **internal state of the Proprium**. It is a black hole of self-absorption. The fact that the Queen is consumed by the mirror is a perfect visual representation of Swedenborg's teaching that "Evil is its own punishment." The Proprium consumes itself. She is not killed by Snow White (which would be external combat); she is consumed by the medium of her own vanity (internal vastation).

Furthermore, Swedenborg notes that "broken glass" or a shattered vessel signifies the destruction of truths by falsities, or the breaking of the container of the letter to reveal the internal. By shattering the mirror, the Queen destroys the container of her own self-image, revealing the "abyss" of her non-existence beneath.

### 6.2 The "Void" and the "Broken Mirror"

The imagery of the broken mirror in the 2025 film is particularly significant. When the Queen smashes the mirror, she is attempting to destroy the *Truth* (that Snow White is fairest). In Swedenborgian terms, to destroy Truth is to commit **Profanation**.

The result is not that the mirror ceases to function, but that it opens a **"Void."** This corresponds to the **"Hell of the Profaners"**—those who mix truth and evil. They are not merely "punished" by an external agent; they are "swallowed up" by their own interior state. The 2025 film's visual of the Queen turning to ash (total lack of spiritual life) and being pulled into the dark dimension is a profound representation of **Second Death**. It is a far more severe and spiritually accurate consequence than the cliff fall in the 1937 film, which could be interpreted as accidental or natural. The 2025 death is explicitly spiritual and internal.

### 6.3 The Mirror as *Speculum Vivum*

In contrast to the Queen's relationship with the Mirror (narcissistic self-confirmation), the Mirror's function in relation to Snow White is one of objective truth. The Mirror speaks the truth ("Snow White is fairest") regardless of the Queen's feelings. It represents a **Theistic** theology: Truth is objective, external, and often painful. It creates tension. It demands that the "Old Man" (Queen) be destroyed so that the "New Man" (Snow White) can rule.

The live-action film, by centering the Mirror and the Queen's struggle with it, retains the dramatic tension of **Judgment**. It acknowledges that there is an objective moral order that cannot be bribed or shattered without consequence. *Wish* tries to democratize magic ("everyone gets a wish"), effectively removing the hierarchy of spiritual degrees. *Snow White* maintains the hierarchy: The Queen falls because she violates the order; Snow White rises because she aligns with it (Father's Daughter/Jonathan's Partner).

---

## VII. Comparative Synthesis: The Mirror vs. The Star

The divergence between *Wish* and *Snow White* ultimately comes down to the symbols they choose to center: **The Star** and **The Mirror**.

### 7.1 The Star: The Failure of Humanism

In *Wish*, the Star is a cute, silent character—a "mascot" of the self. It validates Asha's desires without challenging them. It represents a **Humanist** theology: the divine is friendly, internal, and affirms our "truth." This leads to a spiritual flatness because there is no tension between the "Old Man" (Proprium) and the "New Man" (Regenerate Soul). Everyone is already a "Star."

### 7.2 The Mirror: The Persistence of Theism

In *Snow White*, the Mirror is a terrifying, judgmental force. It speaks the Truth ("You are not the fairest") regardless of the Queen's feelings. It represents a **Theistic** theology: Truth is objective, external, and often painful. It creates tension. It demands that the "Old Man" (Queen) be destroyed so that the "New Man" (Snow White) can rule.

### 7.4 The Paradox of "Wokeness"

Ironically, the very elements of *Snow White* labeled as "woke" or "modern" by critics—Snow White's leadership, the active role of Jonathan, the removal of the "saving kiss" as the sole resolution—align her *more* closely with the Swedenborgian ideal of the **Regenerate Person**.

* **The 1937 Snow White** is the "Church in Expectation"—passive, waiting for Grace.
* **The 2025 Snow White** is the "Church in Act"—cooperating with Grace (Jonathan) to banish Evil (Queen).

Swedenborg argues that man must act "as if from himself" to shun evils. Passive waiting is "Faith Alone," which is spiritually dead. Therefore, the "girlboss" energy of the new Snow White, when viewed through this specific theological lens, is actually a correction of the "Faith Alone" passivity of the 1937 original. She is taking up the "Sword of Truth" (figuratively) and engaging in the work of regeneration.

## VIII. Intentionality and the Ghost in the Machine

Does this evidence prove that Marc Webb, Greta Gerwig, or Erin Cressida Wilson are practicing Swedenborgians? It is highly unlikely that they are card-carrying members of the New Church. However, the evidence suggests the existence of an "Active Substrate" of Swedenborgian thought within the "Disney Formula" that asserts itself whenever the studio engages seriously with fairy tales.

### 8.1 Greta Gerwig: The Theological Bricolage

Greta Gerwig, co-writer of the screenplay, has a known background in exploring theological themes. Her film *Lady Bird* is explicitly concerned with Catholicism, grace, and the "economy of love." While she is not Swedenborgian, her "Catholic imagination" (sacramentalism, saints, tangible grace) predisposes her to "Vertical" storytelling.

When adapting *Snow White*, her instinct to give the character "agency" did not lead to secular nihilism (as in *Wish*) but to a "Theology of Works." She replaced "Passive Faith" not with "Self-Empowerment" but with "Active Charity" (the Pies). This aligns with the Swedenborgian critique of "Faith Alone" (Sola Fide). Gerwig likely accessed the "Appleseed" archetype via the studio's cultural memory, utilizing it as a shorthand for "American Goodness," inadvertently reactivating its sectarian roots. She intuitively understood that for Snow White to be a leader, she had to be a *server*.

### 8.2 Marc Webb: The Wholesome DNA

Marc Webb, the director, has emphasized the film's "joyous finale" and "wholesome uplifting family entertainment" coming directly from "old-school Disney DNA." By attempting to "honor the DNA," Webb is essentially running the old code. The "DNA" of 1937 and 1948 *is* Swedenborgian (due to Graham, Hurter, and the Appleseed production). Therefore, the more Webb tries to be "Disney," the more Swedenborgian the film becomes. His visual direction of the orchard scenes—evoking Mary Blair's *Melody Time* aesthetic—proves that he is visually citing the very era where these correspondences were codified.

### 8.3 The "Woke" Paradox Resolved

Critics have focused on the "woke" elements of the film—Rachel Zegler's comments about the "stalker" prince, the diverse casting, the "girlboss" leadership arc. However, this analysis finds that these elements have ironically reinforced the "Vertical Spiritual Logic" of the film.

* **Rejection of the Stalker Prince:** By rejecting the "passive rescue" of the 1937 film, the creators have moved the narrative from "Faith Alone" (waiting for salvation) to "Cooperation" (working with Truth/Jonathan).
* **Leadership Arc:** By making Snow White a leader who "rallies her people" through service (pies), the film moves her into the "Doctrine of Use." She is not just being good; she is *doing* good. In Swedenborgian terms, this is a higher spiritual state. The "modernization" has inadvertently made the film more theologically rigorous.

## IX. Conclusion: The Unintended Reformation

The investigation concludes that the 2025 live-action *Snow White* provides structural proof of intentional (or at least structurally inevitable) Swedenborgian adherence. The film stands as a "theological correction" to the Gnostic humanism of *Wish*. Where *Wish* trapped the divine in the self, *Snow White* (2025) restores the mirror—not as a tool of vanity, but as a terrifying, vertical window into the ontological reality of the soul.

The evidence is cumulative and mutually reinforcing:

1. **The "Apple Orchard backstory"** links the heroine to the "Blessings Three" (Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree) of Johnny Appleseed, grounding her character in the "Doctrine of Use."
2. **The character of Jonathan** ("God-given") restores the Intellect-Will dynamic of Swedenborgian regeneration, replacing passive romance with active cooperation.
3. **The song "Waiting on a Wish"** explicitly rejects the "Echo" mechanism of self-amplification and affirms the Vertical posture of prayer—desiring to *give*, not to *receive*.
4. **The Magic Mirror** is elevated to a site of Judgment, and the Queen's destruction by the Void is a precise visual representation of "Vastation" and "Second Death."
5. **The visual design** evokes the Mary Blair aesthetic of the Swedenborgian "Golden Age" of the studio.

Snow White is not "fairest" because she is pretty; she is "fairest" because she is Useful. She bakes pies. She feeds the village. She manifests her internal love in external works. She waits for influx from above while acting "as if from herself" to restore the kingdom.

The creative leadership, in their attempt to "modernize" the story, has stripped away the "romance" (Horizontal) and replaced it with "alliance" and "judgment" (Vertical). They have replaced the "Prince" with "Truth" (Jonathan) and the "Cliff" with the "Void." In doing so, they have produced a film that is arguably more spiritually rigorous than the original it seeks to update.

The commercial fate of the film may be subject to the whims of the "culture war," but its metaphysical architecture stands as a testament to the enduring power of the Vertical Mirror. The "Magic" of Disney, it seems, cannot be sustained by "Stardust" alone; it requires the "Apple"—the tangible, edible fruit of a life lived in correspondence with the Divine.

As Disney moves forward, the lesson is clear: The "Magic" does not come from the *idea* of magic (The Star); it comes from the *obedience* to spiritual laws (The Mirror). To reanimate its soul, the studio must look less at its own reflection in the water ("I'm a Star") and more at the hard truth in the glass.
