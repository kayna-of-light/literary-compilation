## Open Questions

### Critical Analysis Follow-Up Questions

The following questions emerged from rigorous critical review of framework claims (2025-12-27). These require external research to strengthen or revise framework positions.

---

### [NDE] Cross-Cultural Being Identification

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework claims NDErs identify "Being of Light" as Jesus based on personality match, even atheists/non-Christians. Critical analysis challenges this: selection bias (most studies in Christian-majority cultures) and expectation effects. Need cross-cultural statistical data.

**Research Question**:
In NDEs from Hindu-majority, Buddhist-majority, and Islamic-majority populations, what percentage of experiencers identify the "Being of Light" encountered as:
1. Jesus Christ
2. Deities from their cultural tradition (Krishna, Yamaraj, Buddha, etc.)
3. Generic "deceased relatives" or unnamed beings
4. No being encountered

Does personality-based identification transcend cultural conditioning, or do experiencers interpret the encounter through pre-existing religious frameworks?

**Notes**:
If Hindu NDErs predominantly report Hindu deities rather than Jesus, framework's "pure identification" claim requires revision. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 7B.

### [GDR] Dying Brain Hypothesis - Current State

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework interprets NDEs as evidence for post-mortem consciousness. Critical analysis notes framework doesn't adequately engage strongest neuroscientific alternatives. Need comprehensive review of current dying brain research to address fairly.

**Research Question**:
What is the current state of neuroscientific explanations for NDE phenomenology? Specifically:
1. Borjigin et al. (2013) findings on surge of brain activity at death
2. DMT hypothesis (Strassman; endogenous release at death)
3. Temporal lobe seizure models for life review
4. Visual cortex explanations for tunnel/light
5. Recent AWARE study results and methodological critiques

How do neuroscientists explain veridical perception cases? What are the strongest counterarguments to materialist explanations that framework should address?

**Notes**:
Framework should engage this literature seriously, not dismissively. Veridical perception is framework's strongest evidence; need to know neuroscience's best responses. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 7A.

### [GDR] Dual Inheritance Theory vs. CDE

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework proposes Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) as selective pressure on memetic evolution. Critical analysis notes simpler alternatives (Dual Inheritance Theory, Cultural Group Selection) may explain same data without metaphysical consciousness-as-causal-force. Need comparison.

**Research Question**:
How do Boyd & Richerson's Dual Inheritance Theory and Wilson & Wilson's Cultural Group Selection explain the evolution of cooperation and cultural trajectories? Specifically:
1. What predictions do these theories make about cultural evolution?
2. How do they explain the emergence of prosocial norms without "ruling love" mechanism?
3. What empirical tests distinguish these theories from CDE?
4. Do these theories require consciousness-as-fundamental or treat it as epiphenomenon?

Can CDE make any prediction that these simpler theories cannot? What would constitute evidence *requiring* consciousness as causal driver rather than accompanying correlate?

**Notes**:
If simpler theories explain same data, Occam's Razor favors them unless CDE adds unique predictive power. Framework needs honest comparison. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 2B and `alternative_theories.md` action item.

### [GDR] Oral Tradition Stability Research

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework cites Aboriginal songlines preserving "14,000-year narratives" as evidence oral traditions could preserve Ancient Word. Critical analysis notes: geographic features dating to post-glacial period ≠ narrative content remaining unchanged. Need linguistic/anthropological research on oral tradition drift.

**Research Question**:
What is the scholarly consensus on stability vs. drift in oral traditions over millennia? Specifically:
1. Jack Goody's work on oral vs. literate cultures
2. Studies of transmission fidelity in non-literate societies
3. Difference between preserving geographic/ecological information vs. narrative content
4. Documented cases of oral tradition modification over generations
5. Australian Aboriginal songline research: what's verified vs. romanticized?

Can oral traditions preserve *specific narrative content* accurately over 10,000+ years, or do they exhibit significant drift and innovation while maintaining thematic continuity?

**Notes**:
Framework needs this to support Ancient Word hypothesis. If oral traditions show substantial drift, claim that Ancient Word could persist accurately through oral transmission weakens. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 4B.

### [NLM] Swedenborg's Cultural Context

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework applies historical-critical method to Bible but not to Swedenborg's writings. Critical analysis recommends either applying HCM consistently or acknowledging asymmetry. If applying HCM to Swedenborg, need analysis of cultural/intellectual influences.

**Research Question**:
What 18th-century intellectual currents influenced Swedenborg's theological system? How do his doctrines relate to:
1. Swedish Lutheran pietism and mysticism
2. Cartesian dualism (mind-body separation)
3. Neoplatonic emanation theories
4. Kabbalistic traditions (his knowledge of Jewish mysticism)
5. Paracelsus and Jakob Boehme (earlier Christian mystics)
6. Enlightenment rationalism (his scientific background)

To what extent are Swedenborg's "correspondences" original vs. synthesizing existing symbolic interpretation traditions? How did his theology evolve across his corpus (*Arcana Coelestia* → *True Christian Religion*)?

**Notes**:
This is **sensitive** but necessary for intellectual honesty. Can accept Swedenborg as revelatory while acknowledging cultural situatedness (as with biblical authors). See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 1C and `framework_improvement_action_plan.md` Action 1.3.

### [GDR] Proto-Luke Hypothesis Scholarly Status

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework presents Proto-Luke (Jamesian protograph) as significant source. Critical analysis notes: hypothesis stacked on hypothesis (Markan priority → Q → L → Proto-Luke → Jamesian attribution). Knowledge graph acknowledges "hypothesis stacked on hypothesis" with low confidence. Need current scholarly assessment.

**Research Question**:
What is the current status of B.H. Streeter's Proto-Luke hypothesis (1924) in NT scholarship? Specifically:
1. How many contemporary scholars accept Proto-Luke as distinct pre-Lukan source?
2. Main arguments FOR Proto-Luke (textual evidence, coherence)
3. Main arguments AGAINST (can be explained by Lukan redaction of Mark + Q + L)
4. Relationship to Klinghardt's Marcionite hypothesis (contested minority view)
5. How does "Jamesian protograph" attribution relate to standard Proto-Luke theory?

Is there textual evidence *requiring* Proto-Luke, or can Lukan peculiarities be explained by editorial activity on standard sources?

**Notes**:
Framework relies heavily on this for Jamesian tradition reconstruction. If hypothesis is marginal in scholarship, claims should be marked speculative. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 14C and knowledge graph EARLY-002 caveats.

### [GDR] DOPS Verification Rate

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework emphasizes strongest DOPS cases (James Leininger, Ryan Hammons) with verified statements and birthmarks. Critical analysis asks: What's the *overall* verification rate? Cherry-picking strongest cases while ignoring weaker ones inflates evidential strength.

**Research Question**:
Of the 2,500+ cases documented by UVA DOPS:
1. What percentage have *any* verified statements?
2. What percentage have *multiple* verified statements?
3. What percentage have physical correspondences (birthmarks to wounds)?
4. What percentage lack verification (no documentation found)?
5. How do researchers handle cases where verification attempts fail?

What are the methodological critiques of DOPS research (information leakage, cryptomnesia, selective reporting)? How strong are Tucker's responses to these critiques?

**Notes**:
Framework should report both successes and failures. If verification rate is low (even 10-20% would be remarkable), that context matters for assessing evidential strength. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 14C.

### [NLM] Paul's Self-Abasement Passages

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework characterizes Paul as exhibiting "proprium" (self-love) based on confrontational passages and authority claims. Critical analysis notes: Paul also has extensive self-abasement language (servant, slave, least of apostles, weakness boasting in 2 Corinthians). Need balanced assessment.

**Research Question**:
How do Pauline scholars interpret passages where Paul describes himself with extreme humility? Examples:
1. "Slave of Christ" (δοῦλος Χριστοῦ)
2. "Least of the apostles" (1 Cor 15:9)
3. Weakness boasting (2 Cor 11-12)
4. Suffering catalogues (2 Cor 6:4-10)

Do scholars see these as:
- Authentic humility (Paul's genuine self-perception)
- Rhetorical strategy (establishing authority paradoxically)
- Mixed: Sincere humility alongside prophetic zeal

How does this complicate framework's "proprium" diagnosis?

**Notes**:
Framework selectively emphasizes confrontational Paul; needs to address humble Paul. Can't cherry-pick. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Sections 5A and 9.

### [EXAMPLE] Consciousness Studies: NDE Beings of Light Statistical Profile

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Example  
**Date Added**: 2024-12-27

**Context**:
Framework proposes that "beings of light" in NDEs correspond to angelic presences. Need statistical data on frequency, characteristics, and cultural variation of light-being encounters.

**Research Question**:
What percentage of NDEs in the dataset include encounters with beings of light? How do descriptions vary across cultural/religious backgrounds? Is there statistical correlation with reported life transformation?

**Notes**:
Relevant to `01_Consciousness_Studies/` domain. Results would support or challenge the correspondence interpretation.

### [EXAMPLE] Biblical Scholarship: Proto-Luke Passion Narrative Sources

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Example  
**Date Added**: 2024-12-27

**Context**:
Proto-Luke hypothesis suggests a pre-Markan passion source. Klinghardt argues for Marcionite priority. Need scholarly perspectives on passion narrative stratigraphy.

**Research Question**:
What scholarly consensus exists regarding pre-Markan passion narrative sources? How does this relate to the Jamesian protograph hypothesis?

**Notes**:
Cross-reference with `04_Early_Christian_History/The Jamesian Protograph...` documents.

### [EXAMPLE] Mythological Studies: Australian Songline Dating

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Example  
**Date Added**: 2024-12-27

**Context**:
The framework cites Australian Aboriginal songlines as evidence for deep oral tradition durability (potentially 10,000+ years). This supports the "Ancient Word" hypothesis—that a universal symbolic system could persist across millennia through oral transmission. The Dreaming narratives encode geographical, ecological, and cosmological information in stable mythic form.

**Research Question**:
What is the current scientific consensus on the age and stability of Australian Aboriginal songlines? What methodologies (linguistic, archaeological, genetic) have been used to date these traditions? Are there documented cases of songlines preserving information about geological events (sea level changes, volcanic activity) that can be independently verified?

**Notes**:
Results support the plausibility of Swedenborg's "Ancient Word" persisting through oral tradition before diverging into national mythologies. See `06_Mythological_Studies/Echoes of an Ancient Word...`
