> **[REFRAMING #5]**: The following document equates "Most Ancient Church" with 40,000-10,000 BCE. Later analysis reframes the "Golden Age" as allegorical narrative for deep hominin evolution (millions of years), with 40,000-10,000 BCE being the **Ancient Church** period *after* cognitive externalization (the "Fall"). "Internal respiration" = decoupling of breath from locomotion (bipedalism). See "A Validation Analysis of Claims Concerning the Most Ancient Church" for the functional mapping.

Communication among the most ancient people (40000 \- 10000 BCE) was fundamentally different from communication today, centering on internal perception, a unique mode of respiration, and the use of representatives in speech.  
The key aspects of their communication, based on the sources, include:  
Internal and Perceptive Communication  
The most ancient church, being "celestial men," possessed a distinctive mode of internal experience called perception.  
• Source of Perception: Perception was an internal sensation that came from the Lord alone, enabling them to know whether a thing was true and good.  
• Knowledge from Love: They knew what was true from what was good, or what was of faith from love. Through love from the Lord, they perceived all things belonging to faith, and often avoided even mentioning faith, lest it be separated from love.  
• Clarity and Perfection: This perception was so perfect that they instantly knew whether anything was true and good. The differences among these ancient churches were chiefly defined by the differences in their perception.  
• Divine and Angelic Interaction: Man was so created as to be able to speak with spirits and angels while living in the body, which they did in the most ancient times. The Lord even conversed with the members of the most ancient church face to face.  
Physical and Vocal Communication  
Their physical mode of speaking reflected their internal state, differing significantly from modern articulate speech.  
• Respiration and Ideas: The men of the most ancient church had internal respiration and only tacit external respiration. Because of this angelic mode of breathing, they were in profound ideas of thought.  
• Ideas over Words: They spoke not so much by words (articulate sounds) as by ideas, similar to angels. These ideas were conveyed more fully and clearly than is possible through modern articulate words.  
• Expression through the Face and Lips: They could express and represent these ideas by innumerable changes of the looks and face, especially of the lips. The numerous muscular fibers in their lips were free, enabling them to express in a minute's time what would require an hour to say today using words.  
• Cessation of Internal Respiration: When internal respiration ceased in their posterity, external respiration gradually took over, and with it, a language of articulate sounds (words) emerged, into which the ideas of thought were determined. This change meant man could no longer have the same degree of perception.  
Style and Use of Language  
The literary and customary mode of speaking among the most ancient people was representative, meaning earthly objects were understood in a spiritual context.  
• Representatives in Speech: When they mentioned terrestrial and worldly things, they always thought of the spiritual and celestial things which these represented. For example, when they saw a high mountain, they perceived not the mountain itself, but the idea of elevation, and from that, the idea of heaven and the Lord. When looking at a tree or its fruit, they saw man and heavenly things represented in them; fruit signified love and charity, and leaves signified faith.  
• Historical Series: They often arranged these representatives into a kind of historical series to give them more life. This constituted the first style of the Word, which was highly delightful to them. The details concerning creation and the Garden of Eden, down to the time of Abram, were derived by Moses from the descendants of this most ancient church.  
• Naming Things: It was customary for them to give names and by names to signify things. They understood the "name" of a thing to mean its essence, and by calling something by name, they understood knowing its quality.
