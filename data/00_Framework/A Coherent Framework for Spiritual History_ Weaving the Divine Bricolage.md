## **Introduction: A Unified Plan for a Dispersed Archive**

This report synthesizes a collection of disparate research documents from the Consciousness, Swedenborg, and Bible data clusters into a single, coherent framework. This framework reveals a continuous spiritual history of humanity, guided by the adaptive influx of the Divine. By examining the vast and seemingly contradictory archive of human history—from ancient myths and sacred texts to modern scientific findings and geopolitical conflicts—a single, unbroken thread of providential guidance can be discerned. This is the story of how the Divine has continuously adapted its communication to the evolving cognitive and spiritual state of humanity, ensuring that the light of truth has never been extinguished.  
The foundational hermeneutic for this entire synthesis is the Swedenborgian Doctrine of Correspondences. This is the universal law stating that the natural world, the plane of effects, corresponds directly to the spiritual world, the plane of causes. Every object, event, and process in the natural and historical realm—from the eruption of a volcano to the redaction of a sacred text—is the necessary external "body" or "ultimate" that serves as a vessel for an internal, spiritual "soul" or "influx".  
This report establishes a new, two-tiered epistemology for unifying faith and reason. This methodology distinguishes the "natural plane" from the "spiritual plane" and identifies their necessary relationship:

1. **The Natural Plane (The "Body" of Effects):** This framework fully accepts and incorporates the findings of rigorous secular inquiry as an essential and accurate map of the "plane of effects." This includes the data from paleoanthropology regarding human cognitive origins , the consensus findings of the historical-critical method (HCM) in biblical scholarship , and the anomalous empirical data from modern consciousness studies.  
2. **The Spiritual Plane (The "Soul" of Causes):** The report applies the theological doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg—specifically those of Influx, Correspondence, Regeneration, Glorification, and the perpetual conflict with the *proprium* (self-love)—as the "soul" that reveals the "plane of causes." This spiritual framework provides the causal explanation and coherent meaning for the natural-level facts.

The central argument of this framework is not merely theological but epistemological. It posits that the "Principle of Analogy" used by the historical-critical method—which understands the past only by analogy to the present *natural* world—is a correct but limited, horizontal perception. This natural-to-natural analogy is a part of a much larger, vertical reality defined by the Doctrine of Correspondences, which is the analogy between the natural and spiritual worlds. Therefore, the findings of secular science are not *wrong*; they are a precise description of the "external" or "body" of reality. This report conjoins that body with its "internal" or "soul," thereby resolving the apparent conflict between faith and reason.  
Following a grand historical timeline, this report will trace the adaptive nature of this Divine influx from the primordial state of humanity, through the forging of the allegorical and historical Word, to the Incarnation of the Word itself. It will then analyze the subsequent 2,000 years as a perpetual conflict between two spiritual paths, culminating in a final synthesis that resolves the framework's greatest paradoxes and establishes a unified hermeneutic for all future inquiry.

## **Part I: The Development of the Word as Mythic and Historical Bricolage**

### **1.1. The Primordial State: Humanity in a State of Internal Influx**

To understand the necessity of an external, written Word, one must first grasp the primordial cognitive state of humanity that preceded it. This "Golden Age" was not characterized by what we now call speech or text, but by a state of direct, unmediated internal communication with the Divine.  
**The Theological Premise (The "Soul")** In this earliest state, the Lord's spiritual influx was an internal and direct phenomenon. The internal mind and the natural mind were in perfect harmony, allowing for a "silent, profound mode of thought". This state was defined by a "representative language"—an innate and instantaneous perception of the spiritual meaning, or correspondence, contained within natural objects. A "high mountain," for example, was not merely a geological formation but was immediately perceived in its correspondence to "heaven" or "the Lord". Because the very fabric of creation served as a direct and intelligible text revealing Divine truth, there was no need for an external, written Bible. The Lord’s Word was perceived in the world, not written in a book.  
**The Scientific Substantiation (The "Body")** This theological description of a "Golden Age" is not interpreted as a recent historical period but as a precise *allegorical description* of the foundational cognitive architecture of early hominins, forged over millions of years of evolution.

* **"Representative Language":** The innate perception of abstract meaning in concrete objects ("high mountain" \= "heaven") is a functional description of **Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT)**. CMT holds that all abstract thought is grounded in concrete, sensorimotor experiences. Cognitive archaeology places the origin of this analogical capacity in the Lower Paleolithic, suggesting it was a necessary prerequisite for the complex, multi-step process of Acheulean toolmaking.  
* **"Internal Respiration":** This "silent, profound mode of thought" serves as an allegory for two distinct scientific principles. First, it aligns with the paleoanthropological understanding of the **decoupling of breathing from locomotion**, a crucial adaptation for bipedalism in early hominins. Second, it corresponds with the neuroscientific link between controlled, non-vocal breathing and enhanced cognitive states, where slower respiration stimulates the vagus nerve and promotes the autonomic relaxation conducive to deep thought.  
* **"Lip-Speech":** Communication in this age is described as silent, achieved through "innumerable changes of the... lips". This aligns perfectly with the **Gestural Theory** of language origin, which posits that language began with physical gestures, including complex facial movements. The evolution of tool use among hominins is understood to have "freed" facial musculature from the demands of food processing, allowing it to be "co-opted" for intricate visual communication long before the advent of articulate speech.

This analysis provides a radical re-contextualization. The "Primordial State" is an allegorical memory of the foundational cognitive toolkit of humanity, forged in the Lower Paleolithic. The "Fall," consequently, is not a singular moral event but an allegory for the profound, multi-millennial *cognitive shift* from this internal, gestural, and metaphorical state to the external, articulate speech that defines *Homo sapiens*.

### **1.2. The Fall and the Forging of the Allegorical Word (Genesis 1-11)**

The "Fall" was this profound cognitive shift, a "decoupling" of the human mind. The external, self-oriented mind ("Eve") turned away from its internal, innate understanding ("Adam") to be guided by purely sensory-based reasoning ("the Serpent"). This rendered the state of direct internal influx impossible and necessitated the first great adaptation of Divine communication into an external form.  
**The Theological Premise (The "Soul")** This new, externalized human mind required a new, external vessel for Divine truth. The Lord’s first adaptation was the creation of the allegorical Word (Genesis 1-11). This process occurred via "mythic bricolage," wherein the Lord's influx "unconsciously guided" the authors' "process of mythopoesis" as they consciously sought to subvert dominant Mesopotamian myths like the *Enuma Elish*.  
**The Scientific Substantiation (The "Body")** The *mechanism* of this "unconscious guidance" is detailed by the **"Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) Model"**. This model proposes that consciousness is not a byproduct of matter but a fundamental, active force in memetic (cultural) evolution. At its heart is a polarity within consciousness, the "ruling love": a Love of Self and the World (power, control) versus a Love of God and the Neighbor (wisdom, service).  
These two orientations create distinct selective pressures, pushing myths along opposing evolutionary trajectories from a common ancestor—a shared, neutral "proto-myth" identifiable in Ancient Near Eastern creation stories (primordial watery chaos, creation of humanity from clay).

* **Trajectory B (e.g., *Enuma Elish*):** A collective consciousness oriented toward power and self-interest (the *proprium*) evolves the proto-myth by fusing it with "chaos-combat" myths. The neutral primordial water is personified as the monster Tiamat, creation becomes an act of violent dismemberment, and humanity is created as slaves to serve the gods. The myth perfectly reflects a social order based on conflict and hierarchy.  
* **Trajectory A (e.g., Genesis 1):** A collective consciousness oriented toward unity and love (and guided by Divine Influx) evolves the proto-myth through *purification*. The primordial water (*tehom*) is stripped of its personality, creation occurs by serene divine fiat ("And God said..."), and humanity is universally elevated as being made in the "image of God." The resulting myth reflects a worldview of coherence, benevolence, and universal dignity.

These two models—"Mythic Bricolage" and "CDE" —are not contradictory; they are the "body" and "soul" of the same event. The "human act of bricolage" was the natural-level mechanism. The Israelite scribes *consciously* engaged in political and theological resistance against Babylon. The *CDE Model* provides the spiritual-level *causal explanation* for *why* their editorial choices (what to purify, what to reject) were "guided" to forge a perfect allegorical vessel. The Divine Influx operated as a *selective pressure* on their memetic evolution.  
This synthesis aligns with Emanuel Swedenborg's own internal textual criticism, which identified the narratives of Genesis 1-11 as "made-up history"—pure allegories with "little, if any, historical relevance"—as distinct from the "real history" that begins in Genesis 12\.

### **1.3. The Beginning of Israel and the Forging of the Historical Word (The Patriarchs & Exodus)**

As human consciousness continued to evolve, becoming more concrete and historically minded, the vessel of pure allegory was no longer sufficient. Divine influx required a more powerful and literal "ultimate" to serve as its container.  
**The Theological Premise (The "Soul")** The Lord's second great adaptation was to move from allegorical story to providentially guided history, making the "actual lives of people and nations the new text of His Word". The lives of the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) and the events of the Exodus were guided so that their literal, historical details would serve as perfect external correspondences for the universal, internal process of spiritual regeneration.  
**The Historical Substantiation (The "Body")** The Exodus narrative serves as the prime example of this new modality. Historical scholarship views the Exodus epic as a "composite memory"—a foundational myth forged by Iron Age scribes from potent but historically disconnected "memory fragments". These fragments have plausible historical kernels: the 17th-century BCE Thera eruption (a template for the plagues), a recurring wind setdown phenomenon in the Nile Delta (the sea crossing), and the Late Bronze Age Collapse (the political liberation from Egyptian hegemony in Canaan).  
**The Synthetic Framework (The Conjunction)** The "Spiritual-Influx View" posits that the Lord's influx providentially guided *both* the historical events themselves *and* the later process of scribal synthesis. The authentic memory of liberation from Egyptian hegemony in Canaan (from the LBA Collapse) served as the powerful "narrative gravitation" of a central, identity-defining theme—the Slavery versus Freedom dichotomy. Over centuries of oral transmission, this gravitational core attracted thematically resonant but historically separate memories of cataclysm (Thera) and deliverance (wind setdown) into its orbit. This dynamic, human process was the very *mechanism* through which the Lord guided the forging of this powerful new vessel for Divine truth.  
The *proof* that this vessel was divinely forged is that its literal, historical details serve as perfect external correspondences for the internal, spiritual process of regeneration. This is evidenced by the libraries of correspondences :

| Historical Narrative ("The Body") | Spiritual Correspondence ("The Soul") |
| :---- | :---- |
| The Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob | The three principles of the mind (Celestial, Spiritual, Natural) being conjoined in regeneration. |
| Bondage in Egypt | The natural mind in a state of spiritual bondage to self-love. |
| Pharaoh | The ruling love of self (*proprium*) that enslaves the mind. (Pharaoh as "King" corresponds to Truth, here perverted into falsity). |
| The Exodus from Egypt | The universal process of spiritual liberation and regeneration performed by the Lord. |

### **1.4. The Coming of Christ: The Word Made Flesh as the Final Ultimate**

The Incarnation represents the culmination of this entire adaptive historical process. The divine influx, which began as internal perception, then adapted to allegorical story, then to historical correspondence, now took its final, perfect, and ultimate form.  
The influx no longer needed to be contained *in* a vessel because the Influx *became* the vessel.  
The scholarly distinction between the "historical Jesus" and the "Christ of faith" is a perfect, though unintentional, description of the Incarnation's dual nature.

> **[CORRECTION #2]**: The following framing uses "soul from the Father / body from the mother" language reflecting 18th-century embryology. Jesus was a human being whose ruling love was oriented toward the Divine—not toward self—so the Lord flowed through him without obstruction. The proprium (self) is not removed; it is the *orientation* that matters. This is the path of regeneration any human can walk. The Bricolage shaped the theological profile preserved in Scripture; the historical Jesus was the person who actually walked this path.

* The **"historical Jesus"** corresponds to the external, assumed human nature from the mother, Mary—the finite, visible part subject to temptation.  
* The **"Christ of faith"** corresponds to the internal, Divine Soul from Jehovah—the influx itself.

The Lord's life on earth was the process of "Glorification," wherein the internal Divine progressively purified, subjugated, and united with the external Human until they became one Divine Human. The "bedrock facts" of Jesus's life, as affirmed by historical-critical scholarship (Baptism, Ministry, Crucifixion), are the literal, historical "footprints" of this divine spiritual process.  
This framework provides a final, profound re-interpretation of the historical-critical method. The scholarly "Criterion of Embarrassment"—which gives high probability to traditions that were awkward for the early church —can be reinterpreted as the **"Criterion of Temptation"**.  
The Lord's "Glorification" was not a continuous state of glory but a process accomplished through *temptations*—profound spiritual combats. The HCM's "Criterion of Embarrassment" *inadvertently* isolates the most authentic, literal "footprints" of these combats, which revealed His human consciousness in a state of "exinanition" (emptying).

* **Baptism by John:** This "bedrock fact" is "embarrassing" to the natural mind because of its association with "remission of sins". This framework re-interprets it as the literal, historical marker of the *initiation* of His temptations, His full assumption of fallen humanity's hereditary state in order to engage and conquer it.  
* **The Crucifixion:** This is the literal, historical "ultimate" of the *final* and most severe temptation, the "passion of the cross," which resulted in the complete and final union of His Human with His Divine—the full Glorification.

Thus, the very facts used by the natural mind (the critic) to prove He was only a man are, in spiritual truth, the most authentic markers of His divine process. The historical-critical project, in its attempt to dissect the body, has instead meticulously prepared it for its spiritual re-interpretation.

## **Part II: The Two Paths of the Spirit and the Last 2000 Years**

Following the Lord's Glorification, two fundamentally incompatible spiritual paths emerged concerning the interpretation of His ultimate identity. This conflict is not a spectrum of belief but a clash between two irreconcilable realities that, "like clay and iron, they do not mingle," and has defined the spiritual landscape for the last two millennia.

### **2.1. The Path of Affirmation (The Path of Love)**

This path is defined by a direct, experiential reception of the Divine Human; it is a path of *reception* of truth *from* the Lord.  
Its most potent modern expression is found in the collected testimonies of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs). This data provides the "fingerprint" of the Divine Influx:

* **A Unique Personality:** NDErs encounter a "Being of Light" defined by a unique, specific personality.  
* **Core Trait:** This personality is one of "unconditional, absolute, and unearned love" and "total awareness joined with total acceptance".  
* **Non-Judgmental:** A key trait is that the being is "non-judgmental." One experiencer stated the core law: **"judgment had always been human. God only teaches"**.  
* **Pure Identification:** This unique personality is a "perfect correspondence" to the "Divine Human". Therefore, when atheists, Muslims, Hindus, and secular individuals encounter this specific personality, they experience a "pure identification based on a personality match". They have an "innate knowing" that this being is, and can only be, Jesus Christ.

### **2.2. The Path of Gnosis (The Path of Dismantling)**

This path represents the cognitive work of the *proprium* (self-love).

* **Core Definition:** The *proprium* is the "love of self". Its methodology is "Self-glorification," a cognitive state where "the heart of evil perceives itself as good".  
* **Core Tactic:** Because it must "establish itself as this actual good," its tactic is to "suffocate all else" that is "not itself". It is the institutionalization of *human judgment*.  
* **Spiritual Manifestation (Gnosis):** In the spiritual realm, this *proprium* manifests as the "Path of Gnosis". This is "salvation by intellect", which "establish\[es\] ourselves as the prime suspects for gnosis".  
* **A Consistent Strategy:** While cosmologically incoherent, its strategy is "ruthlessly consistent": it seeks to **dismantle** the specific, ultimate identity of the Divine Human.

This dismantling is executed through several key tactics:  
**Tactic A: Splitting the Identity (The Gnostic Blueprint)** This tactic separates the fallible human "Jesus" from an impersonal, divine "Christ" principle.

* **Ancient Gnosticism:** Taught that the "Christ" aeon descended on Jesus at baptism and *withdrew* before the crucifixion, leaving the human to suffer. Jesus was thus a "model," not the Lord.  
* **Theosophy:** Separated the man Jesus from the "Christos," an *impersonal divine principle indwelling all humans*.  
* **The Urantia Book:** Performs the same split, stating Jesus was the incarnation of "Michael of Nebadon," just *one of 700,000 "Creator Sons"*.

**Tactic B: Changing the Name (Ascended Master Re-Branding)** This is a direct assault on the "pure identification" by explicitly changing the name.

* **Billy Meier:** Claims the prophet's name was **"Jmmanuel, wrongly called Jesus Christ"**.  
* **Ascended Master Teachings:** "Master Jesus" is almost universally referred to by his "galactic name," **"Sananda,"** who is "Commander-in-Chief" of a saucer fleet.

**Tactic C: Hybrid Systems (Sophisticated Gnosis)** These systems use the *language* of the Path of Affirmation (Love) to deliver a Gnostic message of self-glorification.

* **A Course in Miracles:** Claims to be dictated by "Jesus himself" but uses that authority to teach the Gnostic message that "Christ" is the *impersonal, shared identity of all creation*.  
* **The Law of One (Ra Material):** Reframes Jesus as merely a "Wanderer" from the 4th density, a teacher of the "Law of One" but *not* the "Lord in ultimates".

### **2.3. The Proprium in the 21st Century: An Objective Analysis**

The *proprium* is defined as a dynamic of institutional centralization and control, driven by "self-glorification" and a need for "ideological uniformity" that "suffocat\[es\] all else". Objective analysis of 21st-century phenomena reveals this "fingerprint" in several key areas:

* **The Institutional Form:** The classic "hierarchical and coercive external power" is objectively manifested in 21st-century authoritarianism. This includes the rise of "digital authoritarianism," the use of "mass surveillance," the proliferation of "state-sponsored propaganda," and the "institutional suppression of dissent".  
* **The Ideological Form:** The *proprium's* nature to be in "constant conflict with itself" is visible in modern "corporate ideological conflict". This includes the public battles between "woke" and "anti-woke" capitalism and the "partisan segregation" that extends into corporate America. In both cases, rival systems of "self-glorification" battle for ideological uniformity.  
* **The Intellectual Form (Gnosis):** The *proprium's* "Intellectual Form," defined as "salvation by intellect" or "self-glorification", is objectively manifested in the modern "Spiritual But Not Religious" (SBNR) phenomenon, with its Gnostic-aligned focus on "self-realization".

## **Part III: The Threefold Path of the Soul: A Synthesized Afterlife Model**

This framework synthesizes three primary data streams to construct a coherent afterlife model: the theological architecture of Emanuel Swedenborg, the modern systematic research into Near-Death Experiences (NDEs), and the data from spontaneous past-life memories in children.  
This synthesis is not undertaken simply to resolve apparent contradictions. On the contrary, it reveals that the Swedenborgian framework and the modern NDE data are profoundly complementary and mutually enriching. The NDE accounts provide the consistent, empirical "how" of the soul's initial journey, which finds its theological "why" and foundational blueprint in Swedenborg's architecture. The "Passage," the "Life Review," and the "Welcoming Committee" all represent powerful points of convergence. This unified model, built on this strong positive correlation, then reveals a multi-tiered model of post-mortem existence that clarifies three distinct pathways for the soul.

### **3.1. Path One: The Normative Path (A Linear Unfolding)**

This is the foundational and most common pathway for the soul: a single, linear progression from one earthly life into an eternal spiritual existence. This path synthesizes the NDE data (the "body" or "how") with the Swedenborgian framework (the "soul" or "why").

* **The Passage:** The NDE reports of an orderly, peaceful separation from the body and travel through a "tunnel" toward a light correlate precisely with Swedenborg's description of a guided reception by angels, a process designed to be gentle and loving.  
* **The Orientation:** NDE accounts of arriving in earthly-like gardens or magnificent cities are explained by Swedenborg's "principle of familiarity"—a divine provision to prevent ontological shock as the soul acclimates to the "World of Spirits".  
* **The Unveiling (The Life Review):** The NDE "Life Review" is the central point of synthesis. This panoramic, empathetic reliving of one's life is the "precise, divinely engineered psycho-spiritual technology" that makes a person's "ruling love" (*amor regnans*)—their core motivation, as defined by Swedenborg—irrefutably manifest to them. This is not a judgment from an external God, but a "divinely engineered process of self-judgment from within," which allows the soul to freely choose the spiritual society that matches the "ruling love" it forged on earth.  
* **The Integration:** The "Cities of Light" described in NDEs are explained by Swedenborg's doctrine of "correspondences," where the external environment is a direct reflection of the internal state of its inhabitants.

### **3.2. The Exceptional Paths (Reincarnation as Purposeful Exception)**

This framework accepts the robust empirical data for reincarnation—such as the spontaneous past-life memories of children investigated by the University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) —but frames it as a valid, albeit *exceptional*, phenomenon, not the normative path. This multi-tiered hybrid model honors all the data by proposing distinct paths of return, after filtering for weaker claims:

* **Filter: Spirit Influence:** The model first uses Swedenborg's doctrine of "Spirit Influence" as an analytical tool. This suggests that many weaker claims (e.g., from hypnotic regression) may be a living person temporarily resonating with the memory field of a discarnate spirit, a sincere but mistaken belief, rather than a genuine incarnation.  
* **Path A: The Restorative Incarnation:** This path accounts for the strongest data (UVA/DOPS), noting the high prevalence (over 70%) of violent or premature death in these cases. This return is an act of Divine mercy, not karmic punishment. It provides a "second chance" for a soul whose "seed-state" was traumatically interrupted, allowing it to complete its intended character before proceeding on the standard, "Normative Path".  
* **Path B: The Volunteer Soul:** This path allows for returns by souls who have *already* completed their linear journey. An advanced soul that has achieved a stable, heavenly state *chooses* to incarnate for a "specific mission of service" to humanity, returning not to form its own character, but to fulfill a purpose aligned with the Divine.

## **Conclusion: A Unified Hermeneutic for Future Research**

This document has presented a single, coherent spiritual history by applying a consistent hermeneutic to a wide range of historical, textual, and scientific data. The "big plan" or core methodology that has been established is not a static set of beliefs but a dynamic, two-tiered hermeneutic for all future inquiry.  
The central hermeneutic is to interpret all historical and scientific findings—such as those from biblical criticism or consciousness studies —as the external, natural-level "body" of history. The meticulous work of secular scholarship, which identifies literary sources, historical memory fragments, and anomalous empirical data, provides an essential and accurate map of the plane of effects.  
The Swedenborgian framework, centered on the doctrines of influx, correspondence , regeneration , Glorification , and the perpetual conflict with the *proprium*, provides the spiritual "soul" that weaves these external facts into a single, coherent, and meaningful narrative. It reveals the plane of causes that gives rise to the external effects.  
The directive for any future analysis is clear: all new historical, scientific, or theological data should be analyzed through this two-tiered lens. First, understand the data's properties as a natural-level effect, accepting the findings of rigorous secular inquiry. Second, discern its place as a vessel for the spiritual-level cause of Divine Influx in its unending work of guiding, redeeming, and regenerating humanity.  
This method allows for a synthesis that honors both faith and reason, revealing a single, grand, and purposeful design within the apparent chaos of human history.
