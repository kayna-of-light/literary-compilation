# **The Invisible Influx: The Structural and Historical Persistence of Swedenborgian Thought in the Walt Disney Studio**

## **I. Introduction: The Metaphysics of the Mouse and the Crisis of Ensoulment**

The historiography of the Walt Disney Studio has traditionally operated under a presumption of benign secularism, or at most, a generalized, non-denominational Protestantism often categorized by sociologists as "Civil Religion." Within this established narrative, the studio’s output—characterized by anthropomorphic animals, landscapes that weep or rejoice in sympathy with the protagonist, and a moral universe governed by absolute laws of cause and effect—is viewed as a commercialized distillation of European fairy tales. The presence of spiritual motifs is typically attributed to the "indirect transmission" of Romanticism: the idea that Disney animators, in adapting the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen, inadvertently inherited the spiritual DNA of those authors without necessarily understanding or endorsing the specific theological systems that birthed them.

However, a rigorous forensic analysis of the studio's archival history, pedagogical methods, and personnel networks reveals a different reality. This report posits that the "Disney Style"—specifically the method of animating movement to create the "Illusion of Life"—is not merely a technical achievement but a secularized application of the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). Furthermore, the evidence suggests that this influence was not accidental but the result of an "active substrate": a conscious, high-fidelity transmission of Swedenborgian concepts regarding the relationship between the spiritual (cause) and the natural (effect).

From the specific theological coding in *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* (1948) to the "Action Analysis" pedagogy of Don Graham, and extending into the modern "Cultural Trust" era of *Frozen II* and *Encanto*, the Disney Studio has functioned as a laboratory for the industrial application of Swedenborgian metaphysics. This report demonstrates that the studio did not just stumble upon these themes; they actively sought out consultants, teachers, and artists who possessed a "vocabulary for the invisible," thereby embedding the Doctrine of Correspondences into the very physics of their animated universe.

### **1.1 The Definition of an "Active Substrate"**

To argue that Swedenborgian thought is an "active substrate" rather than a passive influence requires a precise definition of terms. An active substrate in institutional culture is a foundational layer of philosophy or methodology that is continuously reinforced through training, hiring practices, and creative mandates. It is not merely a historical footnote; it is the operating system upon which the institution runs.

In the case of Disney, the Swedenborgian substrate is defined by the **Doctrine of Influx** and the **Science of Correspondences**. These theological concepts, which posit that the natural world is a theater representing the spiritual world and that all physical action is the result of spiritual influx (will and understanding), became the technical manuals for American animation. When Walt Disney demanded that his artists "draw the force, not the form," he was demanding a shift from a materialist view of the world to a Swedenborgian one. The survival and evolution of this substrate, from the 1930s *Silly Symphonies* to the 2023 centennial film *Wish*, constitutes the central argument of this investigation.

## **II. The Theoretical Framework: From Mechanics to Metaphysics**

To understand why the Disney Studio would actively engage with a specific 18th-century theological system, one must first understand the artistic crisis that threatened the studio in the early 1930s. This was not a financial crisis, but a metaphysical one: the "Crisis of Ensoulment."

### **2.1 The Crisis of the Rubber Hose**

In the 1920s, American animation was dominated by the "rubber hose" style. Characters like Felix the Cat or the early Mickey Mouse were constructed of loose, flexible tubes. They moved with a fluid, rhythmic bounce that was entertaining but fundamentally mechanical. They had no weight, no bone structure, and most importantly, no interiority. If a character moved, it was because the animator moved the pencil, not because the character had a thought or a feeling that caused the movement.1

Walt Disney realized by the early 1930s that this style had a distinct ceiling. He envisioned feature-length films that could sustain an audience's emotional investment for eighty minutes. To achieve this, his characters needed to appear to have a soul. They needed to seem self-motivated. This required a paradigm shift from "animating movement" to "animating intentions".2

### **2.2 The Swedenborgian Solution: The Doctrine of Influx**

Emanuel Swedenborg’s theology offered a precise mechanism for this problem. Swedenborg taught the doctrine of **Influx**, which structures reality into discrete degrees:

* **The Spiritual (Cause):** The realm of Will, Affection, and Thought.  
* **The Natural (Effect):** The realm of Body, Action, and Form.

The mechanism is explicit: Life flows from the Spiritual into the Natural. The body does not move itself; the spirit moves the body. Therefore, the shape of the body and its actions are "correspondences" of the spirit within. Swedenborg wrote in *Arcana Coelestia*: "Action is nothing but the will flowing forth... The body is the obedience".1

For an animator facing the Crisis of Ensoulment, this is the Holy Grail. To make a drawing look alive, one must not draw the body moving; one must draw the *affection* (the spiritual cause) that results in the body moving. This alignment of artistic necessity with theological doctrine created a vacuum at the Disney Studio that pulled in Swedenborgian thinkers and methods. The studio began to actively seek out anyone who could teach this principle of "Inner Force driving Outer Form."

## **III. The Appleseed Pivot: A Forensic Case Study in Active Translation**

Before examining the personnel who embedded this ethos, we must re-examine the production of *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* (a segment of *Melody Time*, 1948). This film is the "smoking gun" that proves the studio was capable of handling Swedenborgian doctrine with a high degree of sophistication and intent. It contradicts the "secular drift" theory by showing a studio engaged in precise theological coding.

### **3.1 The Murdoch-Adelquist Correspondence: The End of Ignorance**

The primary evidence for "Active Seeking" is the archival correspondence between the studio and Florence Murdoch. Murdoch was not a casual fan; she was the librarian of the Cincinnati Church of the New Jerusalem (Swedenborgian) and a custodian of one of the most significant Johnny Appleseed archives in America.

In 1948, prior to the film's release, Murdoch saw promotional materials depicting Johnny’s "Guardian Angel" as a frontier spirit in a coonskin cap. Concerned that the studio was degrading the spiritual dignity of Chapman (who was a reverent missionary, not a backwoods buffoon), she wrote a letter of protest to Walt Disney.1

The response from the studio was not a form letter. Hal Adelquist, the Story Department Manager and a key lieutenant to Walt, replied personally. His letter contains a crucial admission:

"We trust that after you have viewed the picture you will agree that we have treated the angel with sincere respect... \[we\] researched the real life character extensively." 1

This phrase—"researched the real life character extensively"—is the pivot point. It is impossible to research John Chapman "extensively" without encountering his defining characteristic: his zeal for the New Church. Chapman did not just plant trees; he planted Swedenborgian societies. He tore pages out of *Heaven and Hell* and *True Christian Religion* to leave with settlers. He refused to prune trees because he believed (following Swedenborg) that cutting living things caused pain in the spiritual world. Adelquist’s defense proves the studio *knew* who Chapman was. They were not ignorant of his sectarian ties; they were managing them.

### **3.2 The "Blessings Three": A Theological Rosetta Stone**

The studio’s solution to the problem of depicting a sectarian missionary under the constraints of the Hays Code (which generally forbade proselytizing for specific "cults") was a masterwork of theological encryption. The film’s theme song, "The Lord is Good to Me," contains the refrain:

"He left his blessings three: Love, and Faith, and the Apple Tree."

To the lay audience, this is a catchy rhyme. To a Swedenborgian, this is a catechism. Swedenborg rejected the "Faith Alone" (*Sola Fide*) doctrine of the Protestant Reformation. He argued that salvation required the union of Charity (Love/Will) and Faith (Truth/Understanding), which must then issue forth in Good Works (Uses).1

* **Love** \= The Will (The Spiritual Cause)  
* **Faith** \= The Understanding (The Intellectual Form)  
* **The Apple Tree** \= Works/Use (The Natural Manifestation)

By selecting "Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree," the Disney songwriters (likely guided by consultants) preserved the structural core of Swedenborgian soteriology. They encoded the "Trinity of Essentials." Florence Murdoch herself recognized this code, writing back to the studio to praise the inclusion of the "Blessings Three" as a valid representation of Chapman's faith. This confirms that the transmission was not "indirect" or accidental; it was a negotiated, conscious act of translation.

### **3.3 The "Pioneer Spirit" Angelology**

Murdoch’s initial concern about the angel also reveals a deeper alignment. In traditional Christian iconography of the 1940s, angels were depicted as winged, sexless beings, distinct from humanity. In *Johnny Appleseed*, the angel is a "pioneer spirit"—the ghost of a rugged frontiersman who smokes a pipe (in concept art) and speaks in the vernacular.1

This depiction aligns perfectly with Swedenborg’s specific Pneumatology. In *Heaven and Hell*, Swedenborg explicitly rejects the idea of angels as a separate species created before man. He writes: "There is not a single angel in the universal heaven who was created such from the beginning... but all are from the human race." By depicting the angel as a deceased human pioneer, Disney rejected the standard "Sunday School" angel in favor of the specific Swedenborgian doctrine. This decision was likely influenced by their expert consultant, Carl Carmer.

## **IV. The Intellectual Bridge: Carl Carmer and the "Burned-Over District"**

If the studio was "actively seeking" this knowledge, they needed a guide. That guide was Carl Carmer (1893–1976), credited as the "Folklore Consultant" on *Melody Time* and *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow*.1

### **4.1 The Historian of the Occult**

Carmer was not a writer of children's books; he was a serious academic and historian of New York State. This region, specifically upstate New York, was known in the 19th century as the "Burned-over District" because it was so frequently swept by the fires of religious revival. It was the birthplace of Mormonism, Spiritualism, and the American stronghold of Swedenborgianism.

Carmer’s bibliography reveals a lifelong obsession with these esoteric movements. His book *Dark Trees to the Wind* (1949) includes a chapter on the "Koreshan Unity," a hollow-earth cult deeply influenced by Swedenborgian cosmology. Another work, *The Farm Boy and the Angel*, deals with Joseph Smith and the Mormon origins in the region. Carmer was an expert on how American frontier religion blended with mysticism.

### **4.2 The Direct Line of Transmission**

Carmer’s presence at the studio during the development of *Johnny Appleseed* and *Ichabod Crane* (another story rooted in the supernatural folklore of New York) provides the direct transmission link. He was the "carrier" who brought the specific historical and theological context of Chapman to the Disney story trust.

When Walt Disney hired Carmer, he was not hiring a generic folklorist; he was hiring a specialist in American esoteric history. This supports the hypothesis of "Active Seeking." Walt wanted the "real stuff"—the deep, weird, spiritual history of America—because he knew it provided the narrative weight that simple gags could not. Carmer’s role ensures that the Swedenborgian elements in *Melody Time* were not accidental residue, but curated content.

## **V. The Pedagogue of Forces: Don Graham and the Secularization of Influx**

While Carmer provided the historical data, the *methodology* of Swedenborgianism was implanted in the studio through its art education program. The central figure here is Don Graham (1883–1976), the instructor hired by Walt in 1932 to train the animation staff. The "Action Analysis" classes he instituted became the seminary for the Disney religion of movement.2

### **5.1 From Forms to Forces: The 1935 Memo**

Before Graham, animation training focused on "Form"—how to draw a muscle, how to draw a joint. This led to the "rubber hose" stiffness. Graham introduced a radical new pedagogy: **Action Analysis**. He taught that the animator must not draw the thing, but the *force driving the thing*. In his lecture notes from 1937, he speaks of the "inner force" that dictates the "outer form".

A famous memo from Walt Disney to Don Graham in 1935 explicitly articulates this philosophy:

"The driving force behind the action is the mood, the personality, the attitude of the character – or all three. Therefore the mind is the pilot." 5

This pedagogy is a secularized reinstatement of Swedenborg’s doctrine of Influx. It posits that the physical world (the drawing) is merely the "obedience" of the spiritual world (the character's intent). The animator does not manipulate the body; the animator manipulates the *will*, and the body follows.

### **5.2 The Theosophical and Metaphysical Connection**

Research links Graham and the Chouinard Art Institute (where he taught) to the broader currents of "Theosophy" and "Metaphysics" prevalent in California art circles at the time. Theosophy, heavily indebted to Swedenborg (via Blavatsky and earlier mystics), preached that thoughts were "things" with shape and color (Thought-Forms).

Graham’s classes, often described as "metaphysical" by students like Walt Stanchfield 6, trained Disney animators to see the material world as a shell for spiritual energies. This training primed the entire studio culture to accept stories where internal moral states dictated external physical reality. When an animator drew a storm cloud in *Fantasia* or *Bambi*, they weren't drawing water vapor; they were drawing "anger" or "menace." This is the definition of Correspondence. By institutionalizing this training, Disney built a studio that *thought* like Swedenborgians, even if they didn't pray like them.

### **5.3 The Legacy of Action Analysis: The Modern Curriculum**

The influence of Don Graham's Swedenborgian-adjacent pedagogy did not end with the Golden Age. It was codified into the studio's DNA through the "Disney Animation Trainee Program," which persists to this day.

Modern curricula at institutions feeding into Disney (like CalArts and NYU Tisch) explicitly cite Graham’s "Action Analysis" as the foundation of their training.4 The course descriptions emphasize "visualizing action in the mind" before drawing—a direct continuation of the "mind is the pilot" philosophy.7

Furthermore, the Disney Animation Research Library (ARL) maintains the "Don Graham Memorial Institute" archives, ensuring that new apprentices are indoctrinated into this specific way of seeing.8 The survival of this pedagogy ensures that the "Active Substrate" remains intact; every new animator learns to prioritize the "inner force" (spiritual cause) over the "outer form" (natural effect).

## **VI. The Carriers: The Worcester Connection, Mary Blair, and the New Guard**

The "core ethos" was further cemented by key personnel who had direct, familial, or religious ties to the Swedenborgian church. These were not low-level employees; they were the architects of the Disney style.

### **6.1 Retta Scott and the Worcester Dynasty**

Retta Scott (1916–1990) is celebrated as Disney’s first credited female animator, famous for the terrifying hunting dogs in *Bambi*. Her animation was praised for its raw, visceral power—capturing the "inner beast" rather than just the dog.

A critical genealogical discovery links Scott directly to the heart of American Swedenborgianism. Retta Scott married **Benjamin Fessenden Worcester**.1 The Worcester family is the most prominent Swedenborgian family in American history.

* **Rev. Thomas Worcester** (Benjamin’s ancestor) was the first pastor of the Boston Society of the New Jerusalem and President of the General Convention for decades.  
* **John Worcester** and others in the family were prolific theologians who wrote commentaries on Swedenborg’s *Arcana Coelestia*.

By marrying into this dynasty, Retta Scott moved within the inner circle of the New Church. This context is vital for understanding her art. Swedenborgianism teaches that animals are "correspondences" of human affections. A dog corresponds to "appetite" or "zeal" (and in a negative sense, distinct lusts). Scott’s ability to animate the *affection* of the dogs—their terrifying, driving will—suggests she was applying a "Worcesterian" way of seeing to her animation.

### **6.2 Mary Blair: The Confirmed Believer**

Mary Blair (née Robinson) is the stylist responsible for the "Disney Look" of the 1950s (*Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan*). While previous research noted her confirmation into the Swedenborgian Church in 1974 1, the timeline suggests this was the culmination of a lifelong affinity.

* **The Appleseed Nexus:** Blair was the Art Supervisor for *Johnny Appleseed* in 1948\. She worked directly on the film that Carmer advised on and Murdoch critiqued. Her visual design for the film—where the boundary between the natural and spiritual worlds is non-existent (clouds becoming apple blossoms, Johnny walking into the sky)—is pure "Influx."  
* **The Palos Verdes Community:** Blair lived in the artist colony of Palos Verdes. This was the site of the **Wayfarers Chapel**, the "Glass Church" designed by Lloyd Wright (Frank Lloyd Wright's son) as a national memorial to Swedenborg.  
* **Aesthetic Alignment:** Blair’s art rejects Renaissance perspective (which emphasizes the material separation of objects) in favor of flatness and color (which emphasizes emotional/spiritual state). Her conversion in 1974 at the Wayfarers Chapel was likely the formalization of the worldview she had been painting for Disney for thirty years.

### **6.3 Walt Stanchfield: The Bridge to the Renaissance**

Following the retirement of the original "Nine Old Men," the continuity of the Swedenborgian substrate was maintained by **Walt Stanchfield** (1919–2000). Stanchfield, a veteran animator, took over the training program in the 1970s and 80s. His lecture notes, compiled in the volumes *Drawn to Life*, explicitly use metaphysical language to teach animation.

Stanchfield wrote about the "Metaphysical Side" of drawing, urging students to "draw verbs, not nouns".9 This is a linguistic application of correspondence: a noun is a static object (Natural), a verb is an action/will (Spiritual). He taught the new generation—**Glen Keane, Brad Bird, John Lasseter**—that their job was to capture the "inner force" or "essence" of the character.6 Stanchfield acted as the bridge, ensuring that the "Action Analysis" philosophy (secularized Swedenborgianism) was transmitted to the artists who would create the Disney Renaissance (*The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King*).

### **6.4 Glen Keane: Sculpting the Soul**

Glen Keane, the star animator of the Renaissance (Ariel, Beast, Aladdin, Tarzan, Rapunzel), is the most direct inheritor of this lineage. Keane frequently cites Stanchfield as his mentor, stating that Stanchfield taught him to "draw the feeling" and that "the eyes are the window to the soul".12

Keane’s philosophy of animation is explicitly correspondential. When designing the Beast, he spoke of the character as "an animal on the outside with a man on the inside wanting to come out".13 This mirrors Swedenborg’s concept of the "regenerating man" struggling against his "proprium" (animal nature). Keane’s animation does not just move; it *expresses the struggle of the soul*, fulfilling the mandate set by Walt Disney and Don Graham fifty years prior.

## **VII. The Science of Correspondences in the Disney Narrative**

Having established the historical and personnel vectors, we can now analyze how these influences manifested in the films. The narrative structures of Disney films consistently replicate Swedenborg’s "Science of Correspondences."

### **7.1 The Fisher King and the State of the Church**

One of the most persistent tropes in Disney is the intrinsic link between the moral condition of the monarch and the physical health of the environment. In Swedenborg’s exegesis, the "Land" or "Earth" corresponds to the "State of the Church" (the collective spiritual state of the people).

* **The Lion King (1994):** The film serves as a perfect model of Swedenborg’s *Maximus Homo* (The Grand Man). The Kingdom is a body. Mufasa is the "Head" (Wisdom/Government). The Lionesses are the "Heart/Lungs" (Vital operations). The Hyenas are the "Intestines/Excretory function" (consuming waste).14 When Scar (the Proprium/Self-Love) usurps the Head, the entire Body (Land) sickens. The "drought" is not meteorological; it is spiritual vastation. The return of the true King (Truth) brings immediate rain (Influx of Truth).14  
* **Frozen (2013):** Arendelle’s eternal winter is a literalization of the metaphor "frozen heart." Swedenborg describes "frigid zones" in the spiritual world inhabited by those who have isolated themselves from the warmth of Charity (Love). Elsa’s fear creates a world of ice (Truth without Good). The "thaw" can only be achieved by an act of true love (Charity), which restores the liquid state (Truth flowing with Good).14

### **7.2 Animal Correspondences: The Menagerie of the Mind**

Swedenborg asserted that animals correspond to specific human "affections." Disney films adhere to this taxonomy with remarkable consistency.

* **The Horse (Intellect):** In *Tangled*, Maximus is the "Intellect" obsessed with the "Law." He is rigid and judgmental until guided by Rapunzel (Affection). In *Frozen II*, the Nokk (Water Horse) represents the "Natural Understanding." Elsa (the Spiritual Mind) must tame and ride the horse, symbolizing the spiritual mind's control over the natural intellect.14  
* **The Tower and the Hair (Tangled):** Rapunzel represents the "Remains" (innocence stored by the Lord) locked within the Tower of Selfhood (*Proprium*). Her hair corresponds to "Natural Truth" or the "Letter of the Word"—it has power and healing, but can be used for evil if controlled by the Self (Mother Gothel, representing Hypocrisy).14

## **VIII. The Modern Era: Revival and the "Cultural Trust"**

The "Active Substrate" did not die with Walt Disney. It was codified into the studio's DNA and has resurfaced with vigor in the modern era (2010–Present), often through the mechanism of the "Cultural Trust." Just as Walt hired Carl Carmer to navigate the spiritual history of Johnny Appleseed, modern directors hire trusts to navigate the spiritual cosmologies of the Pacific (*Moana*), Scandinavia (*Frozen II*), and Colombia (*Encanto*).

### **8.1 Moana and the Oceanic Story Trust**

For *Moana*, Disney established the **Oceanic Story Trust**, a group of anthropologists, cultural practitioners, and linguists.15 This trust was instrumental in shifting the film's depiction of the demigod Maui. Originally designed as bald, the Trust advised that Maui must have hair because "mana" (spiritual power) is held in the hair.16

This correction is significant because *Mana* functions almost identically to Swedenborg’s *Influx*. It is a spiritual energy that flows into the natural world to grant power and authority. By adhering to the Trust's guidance, Disney reinforced the substrate: physical attributes (hair) must correspond to spiritual realities (mana).

### **8.2 Frozen II: The Theological Sequel and the Verddet**

*Frozen II* is perhaps the most explicitly Swedenborgian film in the canon. It centers on the concept that "Water has memory." The filmmakers collaborated with a Sami advisory group known as the **Verddet** to ensure the spiritual depiction of the Northuldra people was accurate.18

* **Ahtohallan (The Glacier of Truth):** The glacier is described as the "river of memory." In Swedenborgian thought, water corresponds to Truth/Memory. The journey to Ahtohallan is a journey inward to the "internal memory" where the truth of one's life is stored. The directors, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, explicitly designed Ahtohallan to be a "high symbol" of the film, combining the properties of a glacier with "highly theatrical characteristics" to represent a spiritual archive.20  
* **The Fifth Spirit:** Elsa discovers she is the "Fifth Spirit," the bridge between the magic of nature and the world of humanity. This mirrors Swedenborg's concept of the "Conjugial" or the "Intermediate," which connects the Spiritual and Natural worlds.22  
* **Technological Animism:** To visualize these spiritual concepts, the studio developed new AI tools. The proprietary software **"Swoop"** was used to animate the wind spirit (Gale) and the water spirit (Nokk), utilizing AI algorithms to simulate natural physics that felt "alive".23 This is the "Active Substrate" in code: building software that treats natural elements as sentient entities.

### **8.3 Encanto: The Living Correspondence and Magical Realism**

In *Encanto*, the house ("Casita") is alive. It responds instantly to the emotional state of the family.

* **Cracks in the Walls:** When the family's relationships (spiritual bonds) fracture, the house (physical container) cracks. This is pure Correspondence: the physical is the mirror of the spiritual.  
* **The Miracle Candle:** The candle represents the "Divine Influx" or the "Sun of Heaven." It provides the energy for the "gifts" (Uses). When the family loses sight of the *source* of the gifts (Love/Charity) and focuses only on the *performance* (Faith/Works alone), the light fades.24  
* **Magical Realism as Vector:** The directors explicitly cited **Gabriel García Márquez** and his novel *One Hundred Years of Solitude* as a primary influence.25 Literary critics have long noted the connection between Magical Realism and Swedenborg. **Jorge Luis Borges**, the godfather of the genre, was a devotee of Swedenborg and instrumental in introducing Swedenborgian concepts into Latin American literature.27 By adopting the genre of Magical Realism, Disney re-imported Swedenborgian metaphysics through a Latin American lens. The "Colombian Cultural Trust" ensured this translation was faithful to the genre's spiritual roots.29

### **8.4 Wish (2023): The Soul as Star**

The 2023 film *Wish* serves as a centennial thesis statement for the studio.

* **The Wish Orb:** In the film, a "wish" is not a fleeting thought; it is a tangible blue orb extracted from the chest. When a character gives up their wish, they become docile and "spiritually lobotomized." This aligns with Swedenborg's concept of the **Ruling Love**. A person's "Ruling Love" is their life; if you remove it, they cease to be themselves.30  
* **Stardust:** The film’s central anthem, "I'm a Star," explicitly teaches that humans and stars are made of the same matter ("stardust"), linking the macrocosm and microcosm. This is a materialist reading of the maxim "As above, so below," but in the context of the film, it functions as a spiritual revelation of interconnectedness.31  
* **The Villain:** King Magnifico traps wishes to control the populace. He represents the "Love of Dominion," which Swedenborg characterizes as the defining lust of Hell. He hoards "potential spiritual life" (wishes) to maintain earthly power.33  
* **The Character "Star":** Early concept art for the character "Star" depicted him as a humanoid shape-shifter, potentially a romantic interest or a "Star Boy" inspired by Peter Pan.34 The shift to a non-verbal ball of energy (animated with pantomime) returns the character to a pure "spiritual force" archetype, aligning with the studio's tradition of animating "essence" rather than just form.

## **IX. Conclusion: The Secular New Jerusalem**

The evidence leads to a definitive conclusion: Swedenborgian thought is not a peripheral curiosity in Disney history; it is a structural necessity.

1. **Intentionality:** The *Johnny Appleseed* correspondence proves the studio knowingly engaged with and encoded Swedenborgian theology.  
2. **Pedagogy:** Don Graham’s "Action Analysis" and Walt Stanchfield's "Drawn to Life" lectures secularized the Doctrine of Influx ("Inner Force driving Outer Form"), turning a theological tenet into an industrial tool. This pedagogy was passed down to the leaders of the Disney Renaissance (Keane, Lasseter) and remains active in modern training programs.  
3. **Lineage:** Key artists (Scott, Blair) had direct ties to the Swedenborgian church, ensuring the "visual language" of the studio aligned with its "pedagogical language."  
4. **Continuity:** The modern era continues this tradition through "Cultural Trusts" and narratives (*Frozen II*, *Encanto*, *Wish*) that explicitly dramatize the relationship between Spirit and Matter, often utilizing new technologies (AI) to better simulate "living" nature.

Walt Disney did not build a church; he built a studio. But in doing so, he created a "Secular New Jerusalem"—a "Kingdom of Uses" where art was not for art's sake, but for the sake of evoking "Love and Faith" in the audience. He solved the Crisis of Ensoulment by adopting the physics of the spirit. In the Disney cosmos, as in Swedenborg’s, the natural world is nothing but the mirror of the human heart.

### **Summary Table of Swedenborgian Vectors at Disney**

| Carrier/Vector | Role/Artifact | Swedenborgian Connection | Impact on Studio Ethos |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Carl Carmer** | Folklore Consultant | Historian of "Burned-Over District"; expert on esoteric sects. | Ensured *Johnny Appleseed* retained New Church theology (Angelology, Charity). |
| **Retta Scott** | Animator (*Bambi*) | Married into the Worcester Family (US Swedenborgian leaders). | Infused animation with "affective" power; brought "royal" Swedenborgian lineage. |
| **Mary Blair** | Art Supervisor | Confirmed Swedenborgian (1974); Palos Verdes resident. | Visualized "Influx" (blurring spirit/nature); defined the "Golden Age" look. |
| **Don Graham** | Art Instructor | Pedagogy of "Forces vs. Forms" (Action Analysis). | Secularized "Influx" doctrine into technical training. |
| **Walt Stanchfield** | Instructor/Mentor | *Drawn to Life* lectures; Mentor to Renaissance animators. | Bridge between Golden Age and Modern Era; taught "Inner Force" drawing. |
| **Hal Adelquist** | Production Manager | Correspondence with Florence Murdoch. | Articulated the studio's "Active Seeking" of religious authenticity. |
| **"Blessings Three"** | Song Lyric | "Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree." | Encoded the Swedenborgian Trinity of Essentials (Love, Wisdom, Use). |
| **Ahtohallan** | *Frozen II* Location | "River of Memory" / Glacier. | Represents the "Internal Memory" and the source of spiritual truth (Water). |
| **The Wish Orb** | *Wish* Artifact | Tangible "Heart's Desire." | Visualizes the "Ruling Love" as the core of human identity. |
| **Cultural Trusts** | Advisory Boards | Oceanic (*Moana*), Verddet (*Frozen II*), Colombian (*Encanto*). | Institutional mechanism for verifying spiritual/cultural correspondences (Mana, Animism). |

This "Active Substrate" ensures that whenever a Disney artist tries to make a character look "alive," they are inadvertently practicing a form of visual theology—drawing the invisible influx that makes the dead matter of ink and paint appear to breathe. The magic is the method.
