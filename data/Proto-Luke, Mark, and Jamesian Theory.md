# **The Jamesian Protograph: A Forensic Reconstruction of the Proto-Lukan Nexus, the Q Source, and the Politics of Resurrection**

## **1\. Introduction: The Synoptic Impasse and the Shadow of Jerusalem**

The historical-critical investigation into the origins of the New Testament Gospels stands at a precipice. For over a century, the field has been dominated by the Two-Source Hypothesis (2SH), a model that posits the Gospel of Mark and a hypothetical sayings source, Q (from the German *Quelle*), as the independent foundations upon which Matthew and Luke built their narratives.1 While this model has provided a stable framework for generations of exegesis, it suffers from persistent, structural anomalies that suggest it is an artificial simplification of a far more complex organic reality. The primary weakness of the 2SH remains the non-existence of Q as a physical document; despite intensive searching and reconstruction, it remains a phantom text, defined solely by the material shared by Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark.3 Furthermore, the 2SH struggles to account for the "Minor Agreements"—instances where Matthew and Luke, supposedly writing independently of one another, agree against Mark in wording, omission, or alteration, hinting at a literary relationship that the hypothesis explicitly denies.4

This report undertakes a rigorous feasibility study of an alternative, unified hypothesis: that the document scholars have reconstructed as "Q" was not a fragmented sayings list, but a coherent, pre-canonical gospel—a **Proto-Luke**—that served as the primary source for both Matthew and the canonical Luke. Furthermore, this investigation tests the radical proposition that this Proto-Luke was not a Pauline or Gentile creation, as tradition suggests, but a direct construct of the **Jamesian Jerusalem Church**, preserving the ethical rigor, poverty theology, and spiritual eschatology of the earliest Jewish followers of Jesus.1

The proposed lineage—**Proto-Luke (Jamesian) \-\> Mark (Pauline Reaction) \-\> Matthew & Canonical Luke (Harmonization)**—integrates the cutting-edge textual criticism of scholars such as Matthias Klinghardt and Jason BeDuhn, who argue for the priority of the gospel used by Marcion of Sinope, with the socio-historical reconstruction of the "Ebionite" or Jamesian community.1 If this lineage holds, it necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of the resurrection narratives. It implies that the earliest church, led by James the Just, adhered to a belief in **Spiritual Resurrection** (exaltation/enthronement) that was compatible with the continued existence of physical remains. Consequently, the explicit physical proofs found in the canonical Luke—the "flesh and bones" of Luke 24:39—must be viewed not as original historical memories, but as later orthodox interpolations designed to "materialize" the faith in opposition to Gnostic and Marcionite readings.1

This report will demonstrate that Marcion, traditionally vilified as the arch-heretic who mutilated the Gospel, likely possessed the unedited version of this Jamesian Proto-Luke. His "heresy" was, in fact, the preservation of an earlier, spiritual Christology that the emerging "Great Church" sought to suppress and overwrite with a physicalist, institutional theology. By triangulating the literary evidence of the Synoptic Problem, the theological profile of the Jamesian "Poor," and the text-critical variances of the Marcionite Evangelion, we can reconstruct the contours of the "Jamesian Protograph"—the lost gospel of the Jerusalem Pillars.

### **1.1 The Collapse of the Consensus**

The dominant Two-Source Hypothesis relies on the assumption of Markan Priority—that Mark was the first gospel written and that Matthew and Luke used it independently. However, the "Minor Agreements" challenge this independence. When Matthew and Luke agree against Mark in small details (e.g., omitting Markan redundancies or improving Markan grammar in identical ways), it suggests they had access to a version of the story that *was not* Mark, or that one used the other.5

Furthermore, the "Q" hypothesis posits a document that consists almost entirely of sayings, lacking a passion narrative. This genre anomaly—a "gospel" without the death and resurrection—has troubled scholars for decades. If, however, Q was actually a *narrative* gospel that included the passion (which Mark and Matthew then overwrote or edited), the genre problem disappears. This narrative Q looks suspiciously like the "Proto-Luke" proposed by B.H. Streeter in 1924—a foundational document that Luke valued more highly than Mark.10

### **1.2 The "Jamesian" Variable**

The historical figure of James the Just, the brother of Jesus, has undergone a scholarly rehabilitation. Once marginalized as a "Judaizer" in the shadow of Paul, James is now recognized as the central authority of the earliest church (the *ekklesia* of Jerusalem). The theology of this community—focused on the poor (*Ebionim*), the Law, and a non-sacrificial interpretation of Jesus' death—stands in stark contrast to the Pauline kerygma of atonement and the abrogation of the Law.7

If the Jerusalem church possessed a written gospel, it would reflect this Jamesian theology. It would likely be a gospel of the poor, a gospel of wisdom, and a gospel that viewed the Temple cult with suspicion while upholding the Torah. This report argues that we *have* this gospel, fragmented and overlaid by later redactions, in the form of the non-Markan portions of Luke (Q \+ L) and the text preserved by Marcion.

**2\. The Literary Stratigraphy: From the "Q" Illusion to the Proto-Gospel**

To validate the hypothesis that the Jamesian church produced a narrative gospel that predates Mark, we must first dismantle the artificial separation between the "Sayings Source" (Q) and the "Narrative Gospel" (Luke). The evolution of Synoptic scholarship has slowly converged on the realization that Q was likely a gospel in its own right—a realization that leads directly to the Proto-Luke hypothesis.1

### **2.1 The "Q" Source: A Gospel in Disguise?**

The traditional definition of Q is a collection of *logia* (sayings) with no narrative framework, akin to the Gospel of Thomas. However, a granular analysis of the "Double Tradition" (material shared by Matthew and Luke) reveals a document with significant narrative progression.3

* **Narrative Elements:** Q contained not just aphorisms but narrative sequences, including the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness (Luke 4:1-13), the healing of the Centurion’s servant (Luke 7:1-10), and the messengers from John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35). These are not free-floating sayings; they are biographical episodes anchored in specific times and places (Capernaum, the desert).1  
* **Structural Coherence:** Scholars like Kloppenborg have identified a distinct theological structure within Q, moving from John’s preaching of judgment to Jesus’s inauguration of the Kingdom, and concluding with eschatological warnings. This structure mirrors the biographical arc of the canonical gospels, suggesting Q was not a "sayings list" but a "Proto-Gospel".1  
* **The Narrative Vacuum:** The primary argument against Q being a gospel is its lack of a Passion Narrative. However, this is an argument from silence based on the circular logic of the 2SH. If Matthew and Luke simply stopped copying Q when they reached the Passion (preferring Mark's version or a different source), the Passion narrative of Q would remain invisible to us. Recent scholarship suggests that elements of the non-Markan Passion material in Luke (e.g., the specific details of the trial) may indeed derive from this Q/Proto-Luke source.1

If Q had a narrative structure, the distinction between "Q" and a "Gospel" collapses. The document was a narrative account of Jesus's ministry—a Proto-Luke. This reclassification allows us to view the "Q" material not as a disjointed list, but as the *Jamesian Protograph*—a coherent narrative preaching the Kingdom of God to the poor.

### **2.2 The Proto-Luke Hypothesis: Streeter’s Insight and Beyond**

B.H. Streeter, the father of the Four-Source Hypothesis, explicitly proposed the existence of Proto-Luke in 1924\. Streeter observed a peculiar phenomenon: if one meticulously excises all the verses in Luke that are derived from Mark, the remaining material does not fall apart into a heap of fragments. Instead, it forms a continuous, coherent gospel narrative.1

* **The "Q \+ L" Nexus:** Streeter argued that the evangelist we call "Luke" did not weave Q and L (special Lukan material) into Mark. Rather, he possessed a complete gospel composed of Q and L (Proto-Luke) and later expanded it by inserting blocks of Markan material.10  
* **Priority of the Non-Markan:** In this model, Proto-Luke is the primary framework. This explains why Luke often departs from Mark’s order or omits Markan details—he is following his primary source, Proto-Luke.12  
* **Jamesian Implications:** Streeter identified the "L" material (part of Proto-Luke) as having a distinct "Caesarean" or Palestinian flavor, unlike the Roman/Antiochian flavor of Mark. This aligns with the hypothesis that this source emanated from the Jewish-Christian heartland.1

Streeter’s hypothesis effectively identifies "Q" as the backbone of a narrative gospel. If we accept the premise that Proto-Luke \= Q, the "Synoptic Problem" simplifies dramatically. We no longer need to hunt for a lost sayings list; we have its expanded form in the Gospel of Luke and its earlier form in the Evangelion of Marcion.

### **2.3 The Marcionite Key: The "Oldest Gospel"**

The most significant breakthrough in recent years comes from the work of Matthias Klinghardt, Jason BeDuhn, and Markus Vinzent, who have revived and scientifically fortified the "Marcion Priority" hypothesis.8

Church Fathers like Tertullian claimed that Marcion "mutilated" Luke to create his Evangelion. However, computer-aided analysis of "editorial fatigue" suggests the opposite direction of dependence.1

* **Editorial Fatigue:** When a writer copies a source, they often make small changes at the beginning of a passage but lapse back into the wording of the source as they get tired or distracted. Comparisons of Luke and Marcion show that Canonical Luke exhibits fatigue when diverging from Marcion’s text, implying that the canonical author was expanding Marcion’s shorter text, not the other way around.15  
* **The "Missing" Birth Narrative:** Marcion’s Gospel lacked the first two chapters of Luke (Birth of John, Birth of Jesus). Critical scholarship increasingly views Luke 1-2 as a later addition—a "Pastoral" prologue added to anchor Jesus in Old Testament history and biology, countering the "alien" Jesus of the Proto-Gospel.1  
* **The Lineage Confirmed:** Klinghardt proposes that Marcion’s Gospel (which we can call Proto-Luke) was the first comprehensive gospel to combine the Markan narrative with the Q sayings. Canonical Matthew and Canonical Luke are then independent expansions of this Proto-Gospel.17

This creates a convergence between the "Proto-Luke" hypothesis and the "Marcion Priority" hypothesis. The document Marcion preserved was likely the *Jamesian Protograph*—the narrative Q.

| Hypothesis | Source A | Source B | Result | Relation to James |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Traditional 2SH** | Mark (Priority) | Q (Sayings) | Matt & Luke | Q is vaguely "Jewish-Christian"; Mark is Petrine/Pauline. |
| **Proto-Luke (Streeter)** | Q \+ L (Proto-Luke) | Mark | Canonical Luke | Proto-Luke preserves the Palestinian/Jamesian core. |
| **Marcion Priority** | Evangelion (Proto-Luke) | \- | Luke & Matt | Evangelion preserves the original text; Canonical Luke is a reaction. |
| **Jamesian Protograph** | **Proto-Luke (Q+L)** | **Mark (Secondary)** | **Canonical Synthesis** | **Proto-Luke is the direct construct of the Jerusalem Church.** |

**3\. The Jamesian Matrix: The Theological DNA of the Proto-Gospel**

If Proto-Luke (the Evangelion) is the intermediate link, does it reflect the theology of the Jamesian Jerusalem Church? The hypothesis suggests a direct construct from the Jamesian community. This seems counter-intuitive given Marcion's reputation as a radical Paulinist who rejected Judaism. However, a forensic analysis of the ethical and social content of the Proto-Lukan material reveals a profound "Ebionite" or Jamesian substrate that Marcion paradoxically preserved.1

### **3.1 The "Ebionim" and the Theology of Reversal**

The earliest Jerusalem community, led by James the Just, referred to themselves as the *Ebionim* ("The Poor Ones"). This was not merely a description of economic status but a theological title. They believed that God had chosen the poor to be "rich in faith" and heirs of the Kingdom, while the wealthy were intrinsically aligned with "Mammon" and the corruption of the present age.1

This specific theology is the hallmark of the Q / Proto-Luke material, particularly in the sections that differ from Matthew.

* **The Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6:20-26):** Matthew spiritualizes the beatitudes: "Blessed are the poor in spirit." Proto-Luke (and Q) preserves the raw, economic radicalism: "Blessed are you poor (*oi ptochoi*)... But woe to you who are rich (*tois plousiois*)." This direct address to the economic classes mirrors the social reality of the Jerusalem church, which practiced a community of goods (Acts 2:44).19  
* **The Woes:** The "Woes to the Rich" (Luke 6:24-26) are unique to the Lukan/Proto-Lukan tradition. They are absent in Matthew and Mark. These woes mirror the Epistle of James almost verbatim: "Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you" (James 5:1).22  
* **Direct Literary Dependence:** Scholars like Patrick Hartin have demonstrated a web of "catchword connections" and thematic parallels between the Epistle of James and the Q material in Luke, arguing that James and Q draw from the same oral tradition of the Jerusalem Church.22 The Epistle of James is essentially a commentary on the ethical sayings found in Proto-Luke.

### **3.2 The "L" Material: Anti-Temple and Anti-Wealth**

The material unique to Luke ("L"), which Streeter argued was part of Proto-Luke, reinforces this Jamesian provenance.19

* **The Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31):** This parable is the "smoking gun" of Ebionite theology. The rich man is damned not for idolatry or vice, but simply for living in luxury while Lazarus (a name etymologically linked to *Eliezer* and *Ebion*—"God helps" / "Poor") suffers. The parable reflects a rigid caste system of salvation based on economic reversal, characteristic of the Jamesian sect.19  
* **Renunciation of Possessions:** The absolute demand in Luke 14:33—"So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple"—reflects the communalism of the Jerusalem church, where private property was abolished. This is far more radical than the tithing or almsgiving ethics found in later Pauline communities.19  
* **Anti-Temple Polemic:** James was known as the "Opposition High Priest," engaging in a ritual protest against the Sadducean aristocracy.1 The Proto-Lukan material contains fierce critiques of the Temple elite (e.g., the Good Samaritan who shames the Priest and Levite).

### **3.3 The Marcionite Paradox: Why Use a Jamesian Text?**

Why would Marcion, who sought to sever Christianity from Judaism, use a Gospel rooted in the Jamesian Jewish-Christian sect? The answer lies in the "enemy of my enemy" principle.

* **Shared Antagonism:** The Jamesian sect was fiercely opposed to the Sadducean Temple establishment and the "Rulers of this Age." They viewed the Temple cult as corrupt and possibly illegitimate (a view shared by the Qumran Essenes).  
* **Marcion's Reinterpretation:** Marcion likely interpreted this Jamesian anti-Temple rhetoric as *anti-Creator* rhetoric. When the Proto-Lukan Jesus condemned the "Laws of the Pharisees" or the "Temple," Marcion read this not as a call to purified Judaism (James's intent) but as a rejection of the Jewish God (Marcion's intent).  
* **Preservation of Ethics:** Marcion was an ascetic. The rigorist ethics of the Jamesian church—sexual chastity, dietary restrictions (no meat/wine), and rejection of wealth—aligned perfectly with Marcion's Gnostic dualism, which rejected the material world.1

The Proto-Luke was a "direct construct from the Jamesian Jerusalem church" in that it codified their oral tradition of Jesus as the champion of the poor and the judge of the Temple. Marcion adopted this text because its anti-establishment tone served his anti-cosmic dualism.

## ---

**4\. Mark as a Secondary and Polemical Stream**

If Proto-Luke is the primary, Jamesian document, where does Mark fit? The report proposes that Mark is not the earliest gospel (contra 2SH) but a **secondary stream**—a narrative constructed later (c. 70-75 CE) specifically to counter or redirect the Jamesian trajectory, likely under Pauline influence.

### **4.1 The Jerusalem School Hypothesis: Mark as "Re-Write Man"**

Robert Lindsey and the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research argue that Mark exhibits "secondary" characteristics relative to Luke.

* **Non-Hebraic Idioms:** Lindsey found that while Luke translates easily back into Hebrew (suggesting a Semitic/Jamesian source), Mark is full of "non-Hebraisms" and awkward Greek phrasings that suggest he is rewriting a source rather than translating from an original.24  
* **Markan "Pick-Ups":** Mark frequently uses vocabulary that appears to be "picked up" from Luke or Acts and then repeated excessively (e.g., *euthys* \- "immediately"). This "stereotyping" suggests Mark is editing and dramatizing a pre-existing narrative (Proto-Luke).26  
* **The Minor Agreements:** The existence of agreements between Matthew and Luke against Mark (the "Minor Agreements") is best explained if they both used Proto-Luke, and Mark is a divergent offshoot that they occasionally ignored.5

### **4.2 Mark as Anti-Jamesian Polemic**

The theological content of Mark supports the view that it is a polemic *against* the Jerusalem leadership (James, Peter, John).

* **The Disciples as Failures:** In Mark, the disciples (representing the Jerusalem pillars) never understand Jesus. They are "hard of heart," fail to heal, and abandon him. Theodore Weeden argues this is a deliberate polemic to discredit the Jerusalem leadership and elevate a Pauline "Gentile mission" theology.28  
* **Rejection of the Family:** Mark 3:21 and 3:31-35 present a devastating critique of Jesus's physical family. His "own people" (likely his family) think he is crazy (*exestē*) and try to seize him. Jesus then redefines his family as "those who do the will of God," explicitly excluding his mother and brothers who are "standing outside".30 This is a direct attack on the dynastic leadership of James the Just (the brother of Jesus) in the Jerusalem church. Proto-Luke/Q does not contain this specific narrative of family hostility in the same polemical frame.  
* **Pauline Theology in Narrative Form:** Scholars like Michael Goulder and Joel Marcus identify Mark as a "Pauline Gospel." Mark's focus on the Cross (which the disciples misunderstand), the setting aside of food laws (Mark 7:19 \- "Thus he declared all foods clean," a parenthetical comment not found in Matthew or Luke), and the Gentile mission all align with Paul's battle against the Jamesian "Judaizers".33

### **4.3 Dating Mark Post-70 CE**

While Proto-Luke (as preserved by Marcion) lacks the specific details of the 70 CE siege (see Section 6), Mark is clearly a war-time or post-war document.

* **The Abomination of Desolation:** Mark 13:14 warns of the "Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not." This cryptic reference fits the chaos of the Zealot takeover of the Temple (66-70 CE) or the fear of a pagan statue. It reflects a specific historical crisis that Proto-Luke's generic warnings do not necessarily presuppose.1  
* **The Empty Tomb Innovation:** As discussed below, Mark introduces the Empty Tomb, a feature absent in the earliest creedal layers (1 Cor 15). This suggests Mark is innovating a new physical/absence theology in response to the destruction of the community's center in Jerusalem.

## ---

**5\. The Politics of Resurrection: Spiritual Exaltation vs. The Empty Tomb**

The divergence between the Jamesian Protograph and the Markan/Canonical stream is most acute in the resurrection narratives. The Jamesian view, preserved in Proto-Luke and Paul, was **Spiritual Resurrection**. The later streams "materialized" this to serve political ends.

### **5.1 The Jamesian/Pauline Consensus: *Soma Pneumatikon***

The earliest textual evidence for the resurrection (Paul, c. 55 CE) aligns with the Jamesian view.

* **Flesh and Blood Cannot Inherit:** Paul is categorical: "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God" (1 Cor 15:50). He distinguishes between the *soma psychikon* (natural body) and the *soma pneumatikon* (spiritual body). This resurrection is an exchange of vessels, not a resuscitation of the corpse.1  
* **Visions (*Ōphthē*):** Paul lists his own visionary experience of the Risen Christ (light/voice) as identical in nature to the appearances to Peter and James (*ōphthē* \- "he appeared/was seen"). There is no empty tomb in Paul, only an exaltation to God's right hand.1  
* **The Talpiot Tomb:** Archaeological evidence suggests the Jamesian community practiced secondary burial (ossuaries). If the Talpiot tomb contained the bones of Jesus and his family, it confirms that the earliest church saw no contradiction between physical death/burial and spiritual enthronement.1

### **5.2 Mark’s Translation Fable: Transformation and the Soma Pneumatikon**

Mark (c. 70-75 CE) breaks with the Jamesian/Pauline tradition by introducing the Empty Tomb. This act should not be read as merely an argument for the body's absence, but as a literary-theological assertion of the body’s transformation (apotheosis) into a spiritual state, perfectly aligned with Paul's soma pneumatikon.

* **The Translation Fable**: In the Greco-Roman world, a missing body was a recognized literary trope (a "translation fable") that signaled **deification (apotheosis)**, not resuscitation. By reporting the body is gone ("He is not here") and providing **no resurrection appearances** (Mark 16:8), Mark used this trope to confirm that Jesus had been exalted to a divine, non-corporeal status.  
* **Pauline Alignment**: This narrative dramatizes Paul’s theology: the "flesh and blood" body is the seed that must die to be *transmuted* into the "spiritual body" (1 Cor 15:44). Jesus's physical shell is absent because it has been transformed into a heavenly reality.  
* **The Gnostic Loophole**: Mark's deliberate lack of physical proofs (no eating, no touching) left his narrative theologically ambiguous. This *Resurrection of Absence* inadvertently created a **Gnostic loophole**, allowing Marcionites and Docetists to interpret the gospel as proof that Jesus had discarded his material body as an irrelevant shell.

### **5.3 Canonical Luke’s "Physical Lockdown": The Anti-Marcionite Correction**

Canonical Luke (the 2nd-century editor of Proto-Luke) takes the final, polemical step into aggressive materiality. This redaction is best understood as a direct anti-heretical correction of the spiritual ambiguity Mark introduced, designed to "lock in" the physical reality of the resurrection for the emerging Great Church.

* **Direct Contradiction: "Flesh and Bones":** In Luke 24:39, Jesus explicitly denies being a spirit: "Touch me and see; for a spirit does not have **flesh and bones** as you see that I have." This is a forensic refutation of the Docetic claim that Jesus was a phantom and a clear-cut contradiction of Paul’s formula ("flesh and blood cannot inherit").  
* **Forensic Proof: Eating Fish:** Jesus eats broiled fish (Luke 24:41-43) in an act that serves no narrative purpose other than to establish his biological reality. This detail is a crucial anti-Docetic interpolation, asserting that the flesh itself was resurrected.  
* **The Anti-Marcionite Purpose:** By adding these material proofs to the Jamesian Proto-Gospel, the Orthodox editor successfully **co-opted the text’s authority** while framing the Jamesian/Markan spiritual resurrection as a heresy (Docetism) that needed to be suppressed.

## ---

**6\. Dating the Proto-Luke: The Pre-70 CE Horizon**

A critical component of this theory is the dating of Proto-Luke/Q to the pre-70 CE period, making it a contemporary witness to the Jamesian church.

### **6.1 The "Armies" vs. The "Abomination": A Chronological Marker**

The standard argument for dating Luke after 70 CE relies on Luke 21:20: "When you see Jerusalem surrounded by **armies**, then know that its desolation has come near."

* **The Marcionite Variant:** Reconstructions of Marcion’s Evangelion indicate that his text may have lacked the specific "armies" reference or used a more generic "desolation" warning closer to Daniel.1  
* **Vague vs. Specific:** If Proto-Luke contained a generic apocalyptic warning (as found in Q material like Luke 13:35 "Your house is forsaken"), it fits a pre-70 context of Zealot unrest and "wars and rumors of wars."  
* **Canonical Redaction:** The specific detail of "armies" and "circumvallation" (Luke 19:43) in the canonical text is best explained as a post-70 CE update by the "Anti-Marcionite" editor to make the prophecy match the historical reality of the Roman siege under Titus. This confirms Proto-Luke was *pre-70* and Canonical Luke was *post-70*.1

### **6.2 The "Flight to Pella" Oracle**

Eusebius records that the Jerusalem Church fled to Pella (c. 66 CE) after being warned by an "oracle."

* **Proto-Luke as the Oracle:** It is highly plausible that the Proto-Lukan/Q text *was* this oracle. The command in Luke 21:21 ("Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains") functions as the specific instruction that saved the Jamesian community.1 This necessitates the document's existence and authority within the Jamesian community *before* the destruction.

## ---

**7\. Synthesis: The Jamesian Protograph and the Western Trajectory**

The forensic reconstruction yields a clear lineage that resolves the anomalies of the 2SH and explains the theological diversity of the New Testament.

### **Stage 1: The Jamesian Protograph (Proto-Luke / Q) \[c. 50-65 CE\]**

* **Provenance:** Jerusalem / Palestine (Jamesian Community).  
* **Content:** Narrative gospel with heavy sayings material (Q).  
* **Theology:** Ebionite (poverty/reversal); Spiritual Resurrection; Anti-Temple establishment; Torah-observant ethics.  
* **Status:** The "Oracle" that guides the flight to Pella. Preserved later by Marcion.

### **Stage 2: The Pauline Reaction (Mark) \[c. 70-75 CE\]**

* **Provenance:** Rome or Syria (Pauline Community).  
* **Content:** Narrative dramatization of Proto-Luke elements \+ Pauline theology.  
* **Theology:** Suffering Messiah (Pauline Cross); Anti-Family/Anti-Disciple polemic; Empty Tomb (Absence); Abrogation of Food Laws (Mark 7).  
* **Status:** A counter-narrative to the Jamesian authority, emphasizing the failure of the "Pillars" and the new Gentile mission.

### **Stage 3: The Canonical Harmonization (Matthew & Luke) \[c. 85-130 CE\]**

* **Matthew:** Re-Judaizes Mark using Proto-Luke/Q. Attempts to reclaim Jesus for a Pharisaic/Rabbinic framework.  
* **Canonical Luke:** A 2nd-century "Anti-Marcionite" revision of Proto-Luke.  
  * Adds Birth Narrative (Anti-Docetic).  
  * Adds Physical Resurrection (Flesh & Bones).  
  * Updates Apocalypse (Luke 21\) with 70 CE siege details.  
  * Writes Acts to domesticate Paul and James into a unified "Catholic" history.

## **8\. Conclusion: The Vindication of the Jamesian Q**

The theory that a **Jamesian Proto-Luke (Q)** was the first direct construct of the Jerusalem church is not merely a speculative alternative; it is a forensic necessity to explain the literary strata and theological tensions of the New Testament.

This model vindicates the "Q" concept by giving it a concrete historical form (Proto-Luke/Evangelion) and a specific social home (The Jamesian/Ebionite Church). It reveals **Mark** not as the primitive foundation, but as a sophisticated, polemical **secondary stream** designed to pivot the movement away from Jerusalem and towards the Pauline Gentile mission. Finally, it exposes the **Canonical Luke** as a later, harmonizing "hostile takeover" of the Jamesian legacy—a text that took the radical, poverty-loving, spiritually resurrected Jesus of James and dressed him in the flesh, bones, and Roman citizenship required to conquer the Empire.

In this light, **Marcion of Sinope** stands not as a mutilator, but as the accidental archivist of the original Jerusalem Gospel—a text he misunderstood theologically but preserved textually, allowing us, centuries later, to hear the voice of the "Poor Ones" beneath the layers of orthodoxy.
