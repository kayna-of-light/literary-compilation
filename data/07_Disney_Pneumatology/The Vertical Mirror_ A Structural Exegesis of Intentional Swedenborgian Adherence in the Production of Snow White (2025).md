# **The Vertical Mirror: A Structural Exegesis of Intentional Swedenborgian Adherence in the Production of Snow White (2025)**

## **I. Introduction: The Metaphysical Crisis of the Centennial Studio**

The historiography of the Walt Disney Studio has traditionally been bifurcated into two distinct and often contradictory narratives. The first presents the studio as the quintessential engine of secular humanism, a purveyor of "civil religion" where the "magic" is a metaphor for human potential and the "wish" is a secularized prayer to the self. The second narrative, often championed by cultural historians and theologians, paints the studio as an intuitive, almost accidental mystic, a creator whose obsession with the "illusion of life" inadvertently tapped into deep, archetypal myths without a conscious understanding of the specific theological architectures it was replicating.1 However, a rigorous forensic analysis of the studio's output—specifically the divergence between the centennial animated feature *Wish* (2023) and the live-action adaptation of *Snow White* (2025)—reveals a third, far more compelling reality. The visual language and narrative architecture of the 2025 *Snow White* operate upon a fundamental, almost metaphysical premise: that the internal world of emotion, intent, and character can be—and indeed must be—externalized into the visible world of form, movement, and environment.2

The year 2023 marked the centennial of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, a cultural institution that has arguably served as the primary myth-maker for the Western world in the 20th and 21st centuries. Throughout its history, the studio’s output has operated on a structural isomorphism with the theological system of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), specifically his Doctrine of Correspondences, which posits that natural forms are the "ultimate" effects of spiritual causes.1 For decades, this "language of nature" remained consistent. A storm in *The Little Mermaid* was not merely a meteorological event but the externalized fury of a sea king; the wilting rose in *Beauty and the Beast* was not a botanical anomaly but a chronometer of the soul's potential for regeneration. The animation medium itself, by its very nature, demanded a "physics of the soul" where gravity, light, and color obeyed the emotional and moral logic of the scene rather than the laws of Newtonian mechanics.3

However, the recent release of *Wish* and the subsequent production of *Snow White* (2025) suggests a profound schism in this metaphysical tradition. While *Wish*, intended as a tribute to the studio's legacy, has been critiqued for performing a "theological inversion" or "profanation" of these principles, early analysis of the live-action *Snow White* indicates a surprising fidelity to the structural dynamics of Swedenborgian regeneration.3 This divergence presents a paradox: the film explicitly designed to celebrate the "magic" of the studio (*Wish*) appears to have hollowed out that magic by severing its vertical connection to the Divine, while the film most criticized for its "modern sensibilities" and departure from tradition (*Snow White*) has inadvertently reinforced the deep theological structures of the original fairy tale.

Central to this reinforcement is the specific, and seemingly novel, inclusion of the "Apple Orchard backstory." This narrative addition, often dismissed by critics as a modernization attempt to give the heroine "agency" or to cater to contemporary political sensibilities, serves a far more specific theological function when viewed through the lens of the studio’s history. By explicitly linking Snow White to the cultivation of apples and the distribution of pies *before* her fall, the filmmakers have aligned her "ruling love" with the only explicitly Swedenborgian figure in the Disney canon: Johnny Appleseed.2 This report argues that this connection is not coincidental but represents the re-activation of the studio’s "Active Substrate"—a foundational layer of philosophy that acts as the operating system for the studio’s storytelling.2

Furthermore, the surrounding elements of the 2025 production—the visual aesthetic evoking Mary Blair’s work on *Melody Time* (1948), the specific re-characterization of the male lead as "Jonathan" (God-given), and the ontological treatment of the Evil Queen’s demise—create a coherent theological system that rejects the "Faith Alone" passivity of the 1937 original in favor of a robust "Doctrine of Use." This investigation will demonstrate that the "Apple Orchard" is not merely a setting; it is a theological declaration, positioning the protagonist as a cultivator of spiritual good in a landscape devastated by the self-love of the Queen. Through this lens, the 2025 film emerges not as a subversion of the classic, but as a restoration of its spiritual core, correcting the "Gnostic drift" observed in the studio's recent output.

## **II. Theoretical Framework: Vertical Causality and the Active Substrate**

To understand the magnitude of the divergence between the studio’s intentions and the resulting spiritual architecture of *Snow White* (2025), one must first establish the "active substrate" of Swedenborgian thought that historically underpinned the Disney universe. This was not merely a stylistic choice but an operational philosophy that governed the "physics" of the animated world.1 Furthermore, it is essential to distinguish this "Vertical Logic" from the "Horizontal Logic" of Jungian psychology, as these two systems are frequently conflated in film criticism but lead to vastly different narrative consequences.

### **2.1 The Swedenborgian Vertical: The Ontological Mirror**

Emanuel Swedenborg’s "Doctrine of Correspondences" posits a fundamentally different mechanic from the psychological archetypes of Carl Jung. While Jungian analysis views archetypes as projections of the collective unconscious—horizontal structures within the human psyche—Swedenborg’s system is vertical and ontological. Reality is stratified into discrete degrees: the Celestial (Love), the Spiritual (Truth), and the Natural (Effect). In this vertical cosmos, the spiritual world is the realm of causes, and the natural world is the realm of effects. Life flows via "Influx" from the Divine (the Spiritual Sun) through the spiritual degrees into natural forms.1

According to this doctrine, life does not originate in the natural world; it flows into it from the Lord. Forms in the natural world—whether human bodies, animals, or trees—are merely "receptacles" of this life. They do not generate life; they receive it. A tree is not just a biological organism; it is the physical manifestation of a specific spiritual principle (perception or knowledge). An animal is not just a beast; it is an "embodied affection." In this system, a "Mirror" is not just a psychological tool for self-reflection; it is a mechanism of divine influx and judgment. It reveals the "internal quality" of a thing, which is its ontological reality. If a character cuts themselves off from Divine Influx (a state Swedenborg calls *Proprium* or Self-Love), they do not merely suffer psychologically; their physical environment decays (Vastation), and they themselves may cease to exist substantially, turning to "ash" or "dust," which corresponds to "damned love" or the lack of spiritual life.2

This verticality creates a "physics of morality." In a Swedenborgian universe, a lie is not just an abstract concept; it causes a physical distortion. A good deed is not just socially beneficial; it generates light and life. This is the physics that governs the Disney fairy tale universe, where the environment is a "Moral Mirror" of the ruler. When the "Good King" rules, the land blooms; when the "Evil Queen" rules, the land freezes or withers. This is not pathetic fallacy; it is the Doctrine of Correspondence in action.

### **2.2 The "Active Substrate" of Disney Animation**

The adoption of this metaphysical framework at the Disney Studio was driven by artistic necessity rather than religious zeal. In the 1930s, as Walt Disney planned *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* (1937), he realized that characters needed to appear to have a soul to sustain a feature-length narrative. The "rubber hose" animation of the 1920s—where characters moved with fluid, boneless impossibility—was insufficient for tragedy or romance. This required a paradigm shift from "animating movement" to "animating intentions." The solution arrived in the form of a radical new pedagogy, codified in the "Mind is the Pilot" memo of 1935 and the "Action Analysis" classes taught by Don Graham.1

Graham’s pedagogy taught animators to "draw the force, not the form," effectively secularizing the Doctrine of Influx. The drawing became a vessel for an invisible force (the animator's intent). This training laid the groundwork for the studio’s "Active Substrate"—a foundational layer of philosophy that acts as the operating system for the studio’s storytelling. By teaching artists that "the mind is the pilot" and that the body is merely a vehicle for the spirit, Disney inadvertently institutionalized a dualistic, influx-based view of reality that mirrors Swedenborg’s cosmology.

While modern creators like Marc Webb or Greta Gerwig may not be conscious Swedenborgians, they are working within a machine built on these principles. When they attempt to "modernize" the story, the "ghost in the machine"—the structural logic of correspondence—asserts itself, often correcting or overriding their secular intentions.2 This substrate explains why, despite changes in management, technology, and cultural values, the "Disney Magic" remains identifiable: it is a specific, consistent set of spiritual laws governing the relationship between the inner and outer worlds.

### **2.3 The "Carriers of the Invisible"**

This substrate was historically reinforced by specific personnel who acted as "Carriers of the Invisible." Artists like Albert Hurter and Gustaf Tenggren brought specific European aesthetic sensibilities that aligned with Swedenborgian thought (such as the anthropomorphism of nature and the grotesque). Later, artists like Mary Blair became central to the studio's aesthetic identity. Blair, notably, was a confirmed member of the Swedenborgian Church (The Wayfarers Chapel), and her influence on the studio’s color theory and design philosophy cemented the correspondence between "internal state" and "external color".4

Blair's work on the package films of the 1940s, specifically *Melody Time* (1948), established a visual vocabulary where color and form were dictated by the emotional and spiritual content of the scene, not by realism. This "Mary Blair Aesthetic" is crucial to understanding the visual language of the 2025 *Snow White*, particularly in the apple orchard sequences, which visually cite her work. By hiring "seers" like Blair, Walt Disney ensured that the "Active Substrate" was not just a theory, but a visible practice.

## **III. The Precedent: Johnny Appleseed and the 1948 Code**

The most explicit evidence of the studio’s engagement with Swedenborgian theology is the 1948 production *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed*, a segment of the package film *Melody Time*. The historical Johnny Appleseed (John Chapman) was a missionary for the Church of the New Jerusalem (Swedenborgianism). He distributed Swedenborg’s tracts along with his apple seeds, viewing his orchards as a way to prepare the "soil" of the frontier for both physical and spiritual sustenance.

### **3.1 The Murdoch-Adelquist Correspondence: The "Smoking Gun"**

Forensic analysis of the studio's archives reveals that the production team, led by Walt Disney, engaged in "Active Seeking" regarding Chapman’s theology. This was not a superficial adaptation. Correspondence between Hal Adelquist (Disney Story Department) and Florence Murdoch (a Swedenborgian archivist and librarian) confirms that the studio had "researched the real life character extensively" and was fully aware of his sectarian beliefs.4

Murdoch had written to the studio expressing concern that the portrayal of Johnny’s "angel" might be disrespectful or inaccurate. Adelquist’s response, defending the portrayal as respectful and researched, proves that the studio's deviation from strict historical fact (e.g., omitting the specific tracts) was a conscious choice, not an error of ignorance. To navigate the Hays Code and commercial viability—which discouraged explicit sectarianism—the studio employed a strategy of "Strategic Ambiguity," encoding the theology into the film’s lyrics rather than its dialogue.

### **3.2 The "Blessings Three" Code**

The film’s theme song, "The Lord is Good to Me," contains the refrain: "He left his blessings three: Love, and Faith, and the Apple Tree".7 This triad is not a random collection of rhyming words; it is a precise theological encoding of the Swedenborgian Trinity of Essentials:

1. **Love (Charity/Will):** The spiritual motive. In Swedenborgian terms, this is the "Celestial" degree, the heat of the spiritual sun.  
2. **Faith (Truth/Understanding):** The intellectual form. This is the "Spiritual" degree, the light of the spiritual sun.  
3. **The Apple Tree (Works/Use):** The natural manifestation. This is the "Natural" degree, the ultimate effect where Love and Faith are conjoined in Use.

Swedenborg explicitly teaches that "Charity and Faith make one in Good Works".4 Faith without Charity is dead; Charity without Faith is blind. Only in the "Apple Tree" (Use/Good Works) do they find their fullness. By establishing this "Blessings Three" code, the studio created a theological precedent: the Apple is not merely a fruit, nor solely a symbol of the Fall (Eve), but a symbol of *Charity in Action* (Use). The Apple is the "Good of Life."

### **3.3 The Theology of the Orchard**

In *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed*, the orchard is presented as a site of civilization and peace. The lyrics "There's a lot of work out there to do" 9 emphasize the industrious nature of the spiritual life. Johnny does not just pray; he plants. This aligns with the Swedenborgian "Doctrine of Use," which states that the Kingdom of Heaven is a "Kingdom of Uses." Every angel and spirit has a function. Idleness is a state of hell.

By depicting Johnny as a planter who brings "apple pies and apple tarts" 10 to the frontier, Disney established a specific iconography: the apple orchard is the place where the "wilderness" (the unregenerate natural mind) is cultivated into a "garden" (the regenerate mind) through the planting of "seeds" (truths) that grow into "trees" (perceptions) bearing "fruit" (good works). This is the theological DNA that the 2025 *Snow White* reactivates.

## **IV. The Narrative Architecture of Snow White (2025): From Poison to Use**

The 2025 live-action adaptation, written by Erin Cressida Wilson and Greta Gerwig, introduces significant narrative alterations that have been the subject of intense cultural debate. However, the most critical alteration for this investigation is the introduction of the Apple Orchard backstory. This is not a minor detail; it is the structural pivot upon which the film's theology turns.

### **4.1 The Apple Orchard Backstory**

In the 1937 animated original, Snow White is introduced scrubbing floors. Her relationship to the apple is passive; she is the victim of the poisoned fruit. She is the "Church in Expectation," waiting for the Prince. In the 2025 film, the narrative establishes a pre-lapsarian state of activity. In a pivotal dialogue scene, Snow White explains her motivation to the Queen:

"When I was young, my parents and I would pick apples. We'd take them and make pies, and then go out into the village... Pies are luxuries. They don't need luxuries. It confuses them.".2

This dialogue establishes several critical theological points:

1. **The Origin of the Will:** Snow White's "Good Will" is rooted in the memory of her parents (specifically the Father/King). In Swedenborgian terms, the Father represents "Divine Good." Snow White seeks to be her "Father's Daughter" 3, meaning she seeks to align her life with Divine Good.  
2. **The Method of Use:** The method of this alignment is *work*. "We'd pick apples... make pies... go out." This is active charity. She is not sitting in the castle wishing; she is in the orchard working. This recalls Johnny Appleseed’s "There's a lot of work out there to do."  
3. **The Definition of Luxury:** The Queen calls the pies "luxuries" that "confuse" the peasants. This reveals the Queen's spiritual state. To the "natural man" (the Queen), spiritual goods (charity/pies) are useless luxuries. To the "spiritual man" (Snow White), they are essential sustenance. The Queen's rejection of the pie is a rejection of the Doctrine of Use.

### **4.2 The Theological Correction of the Apple**

By giving Snow White this specific backstory, the filmmakers have effectively realigned her "ruling love" with the Doctrine of Use. In Swedenborgian correspondence, the "Apple" (and fruit trees generally) signifies the "Good of Life" or "Works of Charity" derived from Truth.2

* **The Queen's Apples:** The Evil Queen uses the apple as a vessel for death (poison). This represents the **Profanation of Use**—using the appearance of a good thing (a beautiful red apple) to destroy the soul. It is "faith separate from charity," or knowledge used for evil ends.  
* **Snow White's Apples:** Snow White uses the apple as a vessel for nourishment (pie/charity). This represents the **True Use** of goods.

By linking Snow White to the apple *before* the poisoning (a change from the 1937 original), the film reclaims the symbol of the apple from the Fall (Eve) and realigns it with Redemption (Johnny Appleseed/Charity). This is a theological correction that posits "Good Works" (baking pies) as the foundation of the character's strength. Snow White is not "fairest" merely because she is beautiful; she is "fairest" because she is *useful*. She feeds the village. She manifests her internal love in external works.

### **4.3 The "Socialist Agrarian" vs. "Kingdom of Uses"**

Critics and reviewers have interpreted the apple picking and pie distribution as a "socialist" or "Robin Hood" element, noting the film's emphasis on resource distribution and the "socialist agrarian" ideal of the Good King's reign.13 While this political reading is valid on a horizontal level, the Swedenborgian reading offers a deeper, vertical interpretation.

The "Kingdom of Uses" described by Swedenborg is a society where every individual contributes their specific "use" (talent/work) for the good of the whole. It is a spiritual organism. Snow White’s father established a kingdom where resources were shared—a "utopia" of uses.2 The Queen disrupts this not just by hoarding wealth, but by stopping the *flow* of uses (conscripting farmers into soldiers, stopping the pies). Snow White’s desire to return to the orchard and the pies is a desire to restore the spiritual order of the kingdom, where "Charity and Faith make one in Good Works." The "socialism" is merely the political shadow of the spiritual reality of Heaven, where all goods are shared because all goods flow from the Lord.

### **4.4 Jonathan: The "God-Given" Truth and the Bandit Archetype**

One of the most controversial decisions in the 2025 production was the replacement of the traditional "Prince" with a new character named "Jonathan," described as a bandit or a Robin Hood-like figure.14 Critics initially viewed this as a concession to modern feminism or a rejection of the romance trope. However, a structural analysis reveals a profound theological logic behind this specific nomenclature and characterization.

**Etymological Intent: Yehonatan** The name "Jonathan" is Hebrew (*Yehonatan*), meaning "Yahweh has given" or "God-given".2 In Swedenborgian exegesis, names in sacred texts (and by extension, in correspondential narratives) are never arbitrary; they signify the "quality" or "essence" of the character. The choice of "Jonathan"—a specifically biblical name—over a generic European royal name (like Florian or Henri) signals a shift in the character's function.

In the Bible, Jonathan is the son of King Saul (the corrupt, external ruler) but the sworn friend and ally of David (the true, spiritual king). Swedenborg analyzes the biblical Jonathan as representing the "Truth of Doctrine" or the "External Truth protecting the Church".2 He acts as a medium or a bridge. In the 2025 film, the kingdom is ruled by the Evil Queen (a Saul figure/Usurper). Snow White represents the "Church" or the "Soul" in exile. Jonathan, introduced as a "bandit" operating outside the Queen's law, represents "Truth" that has been alienated from the ruling structure but remains loyal to the true order.

**The Spoliation of the Egyptians** Jonathan is explicitly described as a thief who steals from the Queen to feed the poor.2 In Swedenborgian symbolism, "thieves" generally have a negative correspondence (appropriating the Lord's merit). However, in the context of "saving the remains" (the poor/the good) from a "profane dominion" (the Queen), this action corresponds to the "Spoliation of the Egyptians"—the reclaiming of truths and goods that have been captured by evil.

Jonathan enters the "closed" system of the Queen’s tyranny to introduce a new element of hope, functioning as a disruptive force of truth in a kingdom of falsity. This characterization fundamentally alters the dynamic of salvation. Jonathan’s role is to facilitate Snow White’s agency, not to save her passively. This aligns with the Swedenborgian concept of "Cooperation." The soul (Snow White/Will) cannot be saved by "Faith Alone" (passive belief in a Prince). It must cooperate with "Truth" (Jonathan/Understanding) to fight against the Proprium. Jonathan challenges Snow White, urging her to action, which mirrors the function of Divine Truth activating the Will.2

## **V. The Visual Liturgy and Production Design**

The structural adherence to Swedenborgian thought is not limited to the script; it is embedded in the visual "liturgy" of the film—the use of color, light, and set design to externalize internal states.

### **5.1 The Visual Homage to Mary Blair**

The visual realization of the apple orchard scenes supports the "Johnny Appleseed" connection. Production notes and reviews describe the orchard scenes as stylized, with "drifts of pure white snow in an apple orchard" and vibrant colors that contrast with the "drab" or "garish" tones of the Queen's castle.18 This aesthetic evokes the work of Mary Blair, particularly her concept art for *Melody Time* (1948) and the *Johnny Appleseed* segment.6

Mary Blair’s style, characterized by "flatness" and "color as emotion," is a visual application of Swedenborgian aesthetics—seeing the spiritual in the natural, rather than the natural as a separate solid.4 By invoking this specific visual language for the orchard sequence, director Marc Webb and the production design team are visually citing the era of the studio where Swedenborgian influence was most explicit. The orchard is not just a location; it is a "sacred space" of memory and innocence, distinct from the "Vastated" landscape of the Queen’s castle.

The film's use of color adheres to the "Correspondence of Colors":

* **Snow White:** Primary colors (Blue/Red/Yellow). Blue corresponds to Truth, Red to Love/Charity, Yellow/Gold to Goodness. She is the integrated soul.  
* **The Queen:** Purple, Black, and Cold tones. Purple corresponds to the "Love of Dominion" (royal power abused). Black corresponds to falsity and the void.  
* **The Orchard:** described in reviews as having a specific, almost "fake" or "video game cutscene" quality.22 While intended as a criticism, this "unreality" aligns with Blair's rejection of realism in favor of "emotional truth." The orchard is a spiritual memory, not a geographical location.

### **5.2 The Mirror as Speculum Vivum vs. The Void**

In the 1937 film, the Magic Mirror is a passive revealer of truth. In the 2025 film, the Mirror is elevated to a site of judgment and consumption. The production notes describe the Mirror as containing a "being" or "spirit" that speaks the truth.3 From a Swedenborgian perspective, the Mirror represents the "Word" or "Divine Truth" which reflects the internal state of the viewer. For the Good (Snow White), the truth is affirming ("You are fairest" \= You are most full of Charity). For the Evil (the Queen), the truth is intolerable.

The climax of the film involves the Queen destroying the Mirror. According to plot leaks and descriptions, shattering the mirror creates a "rift into a netherspace" that consumes her.3 She turns to ash and is sucked into this void.

This imagery is strikingly Swedenborgian. Swedenborg describes Hell not as a place of external punishment (fire and pitchforks), but as a state where the internal is a "void" or "abyss" because it is emptied of truths and goods. The "netherspace" behind the mirror corresponds to the internal state of the Proprium (Selfhood). It is a black hole of self-absorption. The fact that the Queen is consumed by the mirror is a perfect visual representation of Swedenborg’s teaching that "Evil is its own punishment." The Proprium consumes itself. She is not killed by Snow White (which would be external combat); she is consumed by the medium of her own vanity (internal vastation).

Furthermore, Swedenborg notes that "broken glass" or a shattered vessel signifies the destruction of truths by falsities, or the breaking of the container of the letter to reveal the internal. By shattering the mirror, the Queen destroys the container of her own self-image, revealing the "abyss" of her non-existence beneath.3

### **5.3 "A Hand Meets a Hand": The Hymn of Conjunction**

The musical score, written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, functions as a liturgy for these transitions. The duet between Snow White and Jonathan, "A Hand Meets a Hand" 25, contains lyrics that explicitly describe the process of Conjunction.

* **Lyrics:** "A hand meets a hand / Like it found where to land / And suddenly, I've watched the world come alive".2  
* **Analysis:** In Swedenborgian theology, "touch" corresponds to communication and the transfer of power. The meeting of hands represents the conjunction of the "Will" (Snow White/Love) and the "Understanding" (Jonathan/Truth). It is this union that makes the world "come alive" (Influx). The song explicitly links their connection to the revitalization of the world, reinforcing the "Fisher King" dynamic where the "Heavenly Marriage" restores the land. This stands in stark contrast to the Queen's anthem "All is Fair" 2, which redefines fairness as self-interest ("fair" as in "equitable retaliation").

## **VI. Comparative Pneumatology: Wish (2023) vs. Snow White (2025)**

To fully appreciate the Swedenborgian structure of *Snow White* (2025), one must contrast it with *Wish* (2023). The divergence between these two films highlights the struggle between "Horizontal" and "Vertical" metaphysics within the modern studio. *Wish* was intended to be the centennial masterpiece, yet it failed to resonate deeply with audiences. *Snow White* faces backlash but possesses a rigorous structure. Why?

### **6.1 Wish: The Inverted Influx and Self-Deification**

*Wish* (2023) operates on a "Horizontal" plane. The central theological conceit is that the source of magic is "Stardust"—matter found within everyone ("We are all stars").3 This is Gnosticism or Pantheism: the divine is trapped in matter. It creates a horizontal hierarchy where everyone is equally a god.

* **The Wish Orb:** The film treats the "Ruling Love" (the Wish) as an external object that can be extracted and stored. This commodifies the soul.  
* **Resolution:** The solution is to return the wish to the "self," reinforcing the closed loop of the Proprium. There is no need for influx from a higher degree; the self is sufficient. "I look up at the stars... and I see me."

This structure severs the connection to the Divine (Vertical). It posits that the "Self" is the source of the wish. This is the definition of *Proprium* in Swedenborgian thought—the delusion that life belongs to the self.

### **6.2 Snow White: The Vertical Restoration**

*Snow White* (2025) restores the "Vertical" plane. The source of resolution is Transcendence.

* **Source of Power:** Jonathan (God-given) comes from outside the castle. The Mirror speaks an objective Truth that the Queen cannot control. Snow White seeks to be her "Father's Daughter" (deriving authority from a higher, absent source).2  
* **Resolution:** The solution is the destruction of the Proprium (Queen) and the restoration of "Use" (Apple/Charity). The self is not the source; the self is the vessel for Divine Truth (Jonathan) and Divine Good (Snow White) to operate.

*Wish* posits that the "Self" is the source of the wish. *Snow White* posits that the "Self" (The Queen) is the source of evil, and that salvation comes from aligning with an objective, external order. This confirms that *Snow White* operates on a deeper, more traditional metaphysical plane than the centennial film.

### **Table 1: Comparative Correspondence Analysis**

| Narrative Element | Swedenborgian Correspondence | Snow White (1937) | Wish (2023) | Snow White (2025) | Vertical Logic Evidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Jonathan** | *Yehonatan* (God-Given Truth) | Generic Prince (Romance) | None (Asha saves herself) | Bandit/Partner (Truth outside) | Name etymology; Role as "external aid"; Spoliation of Egyptians. |
| **The Magic Mirror** | Divine Truth / The Word | Passive revealer | Magnifico's Mirrors (Vanity) | Agent of Judgment / Void | Objective Truth; Destroys Queen when she attacks it. |
| **The Queen's Death** | Vastation / Second Death | Fall from cliff (Nature) | Trapped in mirror (Static) | Consumed by Mirror / Ash | Internal collapse of Proprium; "Evil consumes itself." |
| **Snow White** | The Church / Affection for Truth | Passive / "Faith Alone" | Self-Deified ("I'm a Star") | Active / "Doctrine of Use" | Moves from "Waiting" to "Leading"; "Father's Daughter." |
| **Apple Pie** | Charity / Good of Life | N/A (Gooseberry Pie) | N/A | Foundation of Leadership | Link to Johnny Appleseed; Good Works as antidote to Proprium. |
| **The Void** | Hell / The Abyss | N/A | N/A | Destination of the Queen | Hell as emptiness/lack of being (Swedenborgian "Void"). |

## **VII. Intentionality and the Ghost in the Machine**

Does this evidence prove that Marc Webb, Greta Gerwig, or Erin Cressida Wilson are practicing Swedenborgians? It is highly unlikely that they are card-carrying members of the New Church. However, the evidence suggests the existence of an "Active Substrate" of Swedenborgian thought within the "Disney Formula" that asserts itself whenever the studio engages seriously with fairy tales.2

### **7.1 Greta Gerwig: The Theological Bricolage**

Greta Gerwig, co-writer of the screenplay, has a known background in exploring theological themes. Her film *Lady Bird* is explicitly concerned with Catholicism, grace, and the "economy of love".28 While she is not Swedenborgian, her "Catholic imagination" (sacramentalism, saints, tangible grace) predisposes her to "Vertical" storytelling.

When adapting *Snow White*, her instinct to give the character "agency" did not lead to secular nihilism (as in *Wish*) but to a "Theology of Works." She replaced "Passive Faith" not with "Self-Empowerment" but with "Active Charity" (the Pies). This aligns with the Swedenborgian critique of "Faith Alone" (Sola Fide). Gerwig likely accessed the "Appleseed" archetype via the studio's cultural memory, utilizing it as a shorthand for "American Goodness," inadvertently reactivating its sectarian roots. She intuitively understood that for Snow White to be a leader, she had to be a *server*.

### **7.2 Marc Webb: The Wholesome DNA**

Marc Webb, the director, has emphasized the film's "joyous finale" and "wholesome uplifting family entertainment" coming directly from "old-school Disney DNA".2 By attempting to "honor the DNA," Webb is essentially running the old code. The "DNA" of 1937 and 1948 *is* Swedenborgian (due to Graham, Hurter, and the Appleseed production). Therefore, the more Webb tries to be "Disney," the more Swedenborgian the film becomes. His visual direction of the orchard scenes—evoking Mary Blair’s *Melody Time* aesthetic—proves that he is visually citing the very era where these correspondences were codified.

### **7.3 The "Woke" Paradox**

Critics have focused on the "woke" elements of the film—Rachel Zegler’s comments about the "stalker" prince, the diverse casting, the "girlboss" leadership arc.31 However, this report finds that these elements have ironically reinforced the "Vertical Spiritual Logic" of the film.

* **Rejection of the Stalker Prince:** By rejecting the "passive rescue" of the 1937 film, the creators have moved the narrative from "Faith Alone" (waiting for salvation) to "Cooperation" (working with Truth/Jonathan).  
* **Leadership Arc:** By making Snow White a leader who "rallies her people" through service (pies) 33, the film moves her into the "Doctrine of Use." She is not just being good; she is *doing* good. In Swedenborgian terms, this is a higher spiritual state. The "modernization" has inadvertently made the film more theologically rigorous.

## **VIII. Conclusion: The Unintended Reformation**

The investigation concludes that the 2025 live-action *Snow White* provides structural proof of intentional (or at least structurally inevitable) Swedenborgian adherence. The film stands as a "theological correction" to the Gnostic humanism of *Wish*. Where *Wish* trapped the divine in the self, *Snow White* (2025) restores the mirror—not as a tool of vanity, but as a terrifying, vertical window into the ontological reality of the soul.

The "Apple Orchard backstory" is the linchpin of this restoration. By linking the heroine to the "Blessings Three" (Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree) of Johnny Appleseed, the film grounds her character in the "Doctrine of Use." She is not "fairest" because she is pretty; she is "fairest" because she is Useful. She bakes pies. She feeds the village. She manifests her internal love in external works.

The creative leadership, in their attempt to "modernize" the story, has stripped away the "romance" (Horizontal) and replaced it with "alliance" and "judgment" (Vertical). They have replaced the "Prince" with "Truth" (Jonathan) and the "Cliff" with the "Void." In doing so, they have produced a film that is arguably more spiritually rigorous than the original it seeks to update. The commercial fate of the film may be subject to the whims of the "culture war," but its metaphysical architecture stands as a testament to the enduring power of the Vertical Mirror.
