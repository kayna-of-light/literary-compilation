# **The True Wish: A Theological Exegesis of Snow White's Prayer and the Rejection of Gnostic Self-Deification**

## **I. Introduction: The Metaphysical Crisis of the Centennial Studio**

The historiography of the Walt Disney Studio has traditionally been bifurcated into two distinct and often contradictory narratives. The first presents the studio as the quintessential engine of secular humanism, a purveyor of "civil religion" where the "magic" is a metaphor for human potential and the "wish" is a secularized prayer to the self. The second narrative, often championed by cultural historians and theologians, paints the studio as an intuitive, almost accidental mystic, a creator whose obsession with the "illusion of life" inadvertently tapped into deep, archetypal myths without a conscious understanding of the specific theological architectures it was replicating.1 However, the release of the 2025 live-action adaptation of *Snow White* has precipitated a necessary re-evaluation of these categories. While the film has been the subject of intense cultural debate, primarily centered on questions of representation, feminism, and fidelity to the 1937 original, this analysis proposes that the critical dimension of the film has been entirely overlooked: its function as a **theological correction** to the Gnostic humanism embodied in Disney's centennial celebration *Wish* (2023).

In 2023, Walt Disney Animation Studios released *Wish*, a film explicitly designed to celebrate the centennial of the studio and the "magic of wishing" that had defined its legacy. The film’s theology was unambiguous: the song "I’m a Star" declared that "we are our own origin story," locating the divine spark within the material constitution of the characters themselves ("stardust").3 The Star—the film’s mascot—was silent, cute, and validating. It asked nothing. It challenged nothing. The wish was already fulfilled because the divine was already inside. This represented the consummation of a "horizontal" theology, where the source of magic is immanent, democratic, and ultimately self-referential.

One year later, *Snow White* (2025) offered a radically different vision. Its central song, "Waiting on a Wish" (composed by Pasek and Paul), presents a wish that is not silent but crying out—not self-validating but questioning—not complete but seeking.2 This thesis argues that "Waiting on a Wish" functions as the **True Wish**: the wish Emanuel Swedenborg would recognize as the affection for truth seeking its counterpart, the will straining toward alignment with Divine Good, the soul calling upward rather than inward. Through a close reading of the film’s central song, this report demonstrates that the lyrics explicitly diagnose and reject the "self-as-source" theology of *Wish*, instead articulating a framework of regeneration through alignment with transcendent Divine Good. The song constitutes not merely a character's "wanting" moment, but a **prayer of the Will seeking activation**—the True Wish that acts, speaks, and refuses the hollow echo of self-deification.

The divergence between these two films—released within eighteen months of each other by the same studio—represents a profound theological schism. *Wish* embodies the consummation of the Swedenborgian "vastation" trajectory: forms emptied of meaning, celebrating magic while severing its vertical source. *Snow White* (2025), despite (or perhaps through) its controversial "modernizations," reinstates the vertical structure that made Disney's Golden Age films spiritually resonant. This report undertakes an exhaustive, expert-level investigation into this divergence. It posits that *Wish* represents a shift from "Universal Correspondence" to "Cultural Metaphor" and Gnostic self-deification, effectively severing the link to the "Spiritual Sun".3 Conversely, the live-action *Snow White*, through its specific reinvention of characters like Jonathan and its handling of the Magic Mirror, inadvertently reconstructs a rigorous Swedenborgian drama regarding the destruction of the Proprium (selfhood) and the restoration of the "State of the Church".3

## **II. Theoretical Framework: The Swedenborgian Substrate and the Physics of Soul**

To understand the magnitude of the divergence between *Wish* and *Snow White* (2025), one must first establish the "active substrate" of Swedenborgian thought that historically underpinned the Disney universe. This was not merely a stylistic choice but an operational philosophy that governed the "physics" of the animated world.

### **2.1 The Doctrine of Influx vs. The Illusion of Self-Life**

The core of Swedenborgian cosmology is the Doctrine of Influx. Reality is stratified into discrete degrees: the Celestial (Love), the Spiritual (Wisdom), and the Natural (Action). A fundamental tenet of this system is that life does not originate in the natural world; it flows into it from the Lord, who is the "Spiritual Sun".3 Forms in the natural world—whether human bodies, animals, or trees—are merely "receptacles" of this life. They do not generate life; they receive it.

In the "Golden Age" of Disney animation (e.g., *Pinocchio*, *Snow White* 1937\) and the "Renaissance" (e.g., *The Lion King*, *Beauty and the Beast*), this doctrine was secularized as the artistic principle of "Inner Force driving Outer Form".3 Animators were taught that a character’s movement (natural effect) must be driven by an internal intent or emotion (spiritual cause). If a character moved without this internal motivation, it was dismissed as "rubber hose" animation—mechanical, lifeless, and devoid of soul. This pedagogical mandate created a universe where the physical world was transparent to the spiritual. A storm was not meteorological; it was the externalization of rage. A blooming meadow was not agricultural; it was the externalization of innocence.3

This alignment was not accidental but the result of specific personnel and pedagogical choices. The studio actively sought consultants and teachers who could articulate this "physics of the soul," leading to an environment where the "Doctrine of Correspondences" became the de facto operating system of the studio.3 The result was a cinematic universe where the boundary between the "spiritual" and the "natural" was porous, allowing for a direct, causal relationship between moral states and physical realities.

### **2.2 The Proprium and the Cosmology of Desire**

Emanuel Swedenborg's theological system posits a fundamental distinction between desires that originate from the **Proprium** (the self-love that constitutes fallen human nature) and desires that flow from **Divine Influx** (the life-giving current from the Lord through the spiritual degrees into natural forms).3 In Swedenborgian psychology, every person is defined by a "Ruling Love"—the gravitational center of the soul around which all thoughts, memories, and actions organize themselves. This Ruling Love determines the person's eternal trajectory: when oriented toward self (Amor Sui), it leads to hell; when oriented toward the Lord and the neighbor (Amor Dei et Proximi), it opens to heaven.

The Proprium is the vivid sensation that we live, think, and act from ourselves.8 It is the "ownhood" of the human being. While necessary for the sensation of free will, when the Proprium confirms itself as the *source* of life, it becomes the "Love of Self" (Amor Sui), which is the root of all evil and the essence of Hell.2 A "wish," therefore, is not theologically neutral. It participates in the fundamental question of spiritual existence: **What is the source?** A wish directed upward—toward the Lord, toward alignment with Divine Order—is prayer. A wish directed inward—toward the validation of the self as already divine—is the Proprium confirming itself, which Swedenborg identifies as the mechanism of spiritual death.

### **2.3 The False Wish: Self as Source**

*Wish* (2023) constructs a cosmology where the wish is a commodity that can be extracted, stored, and returned. The "Wish Orb" literalizes this: the ruling love becomes an object one *has* rather than what one *is*.3 More critically, the resolution of the film—returning wishes to their owners and declaring "we are all stars"—locates the source of magic within the self. This is the **Gnostic inversion**: the divine spark trapped in matter, needing only to be recognized and expressed rather than received and aligned with.3 The Star in *Wish* functions as a mirror of the ego—silent, affirming, asking nothing. It is the wish that validates without transforming.

In *Wish*, the theological mechanic collapses the "Vertical Causality" of Swedenborg into a "Horizontal" plane. There is no need for regeneration, repentance, or influx from the Lord because the self is already divine. Swedenborg defines the belief that "nature is the source of life" or that "man is God" as the fundamental falsity of the Proprium (Self-Love). By celebrating the self as the source of magic, *Wish* inadvertently celebrates the very force (Proprium) that acts as the antagonist in Swedenborg’s theology.3 The film posits that the "wish" is the most important part of the person—their "truth"—and that any authority figure who withholds it is a tyrant. This ignores the Swedenborgian distinction between "good desires" (from the Lord) and "evil lusts" (from the Proprium), flattening all desire into a valid expression of the "divine self."

### **2.4 The True Wish: Reception from Above**

The True Wish, by contrast, acknowledges that the self is empty without influx. It seeks not to express what is already there but to **receive** what must come from beyond. It is characterized by:

1. **Vertical orientation** — directed toward a source external and superior to the self.  
2. **Transformation** — seeking to become something not yet actualized.  
3. **Cooperation** — preparing to act in partnership with divine assistance.  
4. **Honesty** — acknowledging the insufficiency of the current state.

"Waiting on a Wish" exhibits all four characteristics. It operates on the "Vertical" plane where the source of resolution is transcendence.1 Snow White seeks to be her "Father's Daughter" (deriving authority from a higher, absent source) rather than asserting her own inherent divinity.3

## **III. The Anatomy of the False Wish: A Pneumatology of *Wish* (2023)**

To fully appreciate the correction offered by *Snow White*, one must first examine the error it corrects. *Wish* (2023) serves as the primary case study for the abandonment or inversion of the studio's traditional system. Intended as a centennial celebration of the studio’s history of "wishing upon a star," the theological mechanics it establishes represent a radical departure from the studio's historical metaphysics, effectively "profaning" the very tradition it seeks to honor.

### **3.1 The Star as "Stardust": Immanence vs. Transcendence**

In the classic Disney canon, exemplified by *Pinocchio* (1940), the "wish" is a prayer directed upward to a transcendent source (the Blue Star/Blue Fairy). The puppet Pinocchio is "empty" and must earn his soul through moral regeneration ("brave, truthful, and unselfish").3 This aligns with Swedenborg’s view that the human proprium (self) is lifeless until animated by Divine Influx. The source of life is external and superior to the vessel.

In *Wish*, this cosmology is inverted. The song "I'm a Star" explicitly teaches that "we are our own origin story" and that the divine spark is inherent in the material constitution of the characters ("stardust").3 The lyrics proclaim: "You don't have to look too hard / It's all around and not too far / If you tryna figure out just who you are / You're a star\!".4 This is a Gnostic or Pantheistic framework where the divine is trapped in matter, rather than a Theistic framework where life flows into matter from a higher degree.

The implication of this shift is profound. It collapses the "Vertical Causality" of Swedenborg into a "Horizontal" plane. The "Star" is not a messenger of Divine Providence; it is a "mascot" or a reflection of Asha’s own ego.3 This creates a "closed loop of self-reference" where the universe exists only to validate the ego's desires. The "magic" is democratized to the point of meaninglessness; if everyone is a star, and the source of power is internal biology ("genes from outer space" 10), then there is no moral requirement for its use, only a requirement for its liberation.

### **3.2 The Wish Orb: The Commodification of the Ruling Love**

The film introduces the concept of the "Wish Orb," a physical sphere containing a person's greatest desire. King Magnifico extracts these orbs and keeps them in his castle for "safekeeping," causing the citizens to forget their wishes and live in a state of docile contentment.3 In Swedenborgian psychology, every being is defined by a "Ruling Love" (Dominant Love). This is the gravitational center of the soul. All thoughts, actions, and memories organize themselves around this core desire. If the ruling love is removed, the person effectively ceases to exist or becomes a "spiritual zombie" until it is restored.3

By treating the Ruling Love as an external object that can be given away, stored, or shattered, *Wish* commodifies the spiritual essence. In Swedenborg’s system, the Ruling Love is the life of the person; it cannot be extracted without death. The film’s mechanic suggests that the soul is a possession one *has*, rather than what one *is*. Furthermore, the film’s solution to this tyranny is not to restore the wishes to a higher order (Divine Will) but to return them to the "self," reinforcing the closed loop of the Proprium. The resolution is the "Liberation of the Self," which Swedenborg would identify as the liberation of the Proprium—a spiritual disaster masquerading as a triumph.

### **3.3 The Hollow Echo and the Vastation of Meaning**

Critics and analysts have frequently noted that *Wish* feels "hollow" or lacks the emotional weight of earlier films.3 From a Swedenborgian perspective, this is the inevitable result of the "Closed Loop of Self-Reference".1 The mechanism of "Universal Correspondence" relies on the influx of the Infinite (the Divine) into the Finite (the Natural). This creates a sense of depth, mystery, and life. When the "vertical" connection to the Divine is severed in favor of the "self" (which is finite and dead in itself), the artistic product loses its "soul." It mimics the forms of correspondence—talking animals, magic sparks, musical numbers—but lacks the influx that gives them life.

The concept of the "Echo" becomes central here. In *Wish*, the magic is an echo of the self. Asha looks up at the stars and sees herself.1 The lyrics of "This Wish" and "I'm a Star" encourage the characters to listen to their own inner voice as the ultimate authority. This is the "echo" that *Snow White* (2025) will explicitly identify and reject.

## **IV. Exegesis: The Lyrical Architecture of "Waiting on a Wish"**

If *Wish* is the theology of the Echo, *Snow White* (2025) is the theology of the Voice. The film's central song, "Waiting on a Wish," functions as a systematic refutation of the Gnostic premises of its predecessor. Through a close reading of the lyrics, we can trace the movement from the prison of the Proprium to the liberation of Influx.

### **4.1 The Prison of Repetition (Verses 1-2)**

The song opens with an image of stasis and entrapment:

*Little girl at a lonely well* *With the same little tale to tell* *Feeling trapped by the walls that hold her* *Feeling stuck in the story they've told her* 5

The imagery immediately evokes the 1937 film's iconic wishing well sequence ("I'm Wishing"). But something is wrong. The well is "lonely." The tale is "the same"—repetition without transformation. The walls "trap" her. And critically, the story has been **told to her** rather than lived by her. This is meta-awareness. Snow White recognizes she is in a narrative she did not choose. Read through the lens of the Disney theological crisis, this is the studio acknowledging that the princess formula has become a prison. The "story they've told her" is the post-*Wish* theology: that magic is self-expression, that wishing is enough, that everyone is already complete.

The second verse deepens the diagnosis:

*Another day where she fades away* *Never daring to disobey* *So she's dreaming all alone* *Sharing secrets with the stone* 5

"Fading away" corresponds to Swedenborg's description of spiritual death as the dimming of life when cut off from influx. "Sharing secrets with the stone" suggests prayer that receives no response—the echo that returns only the self. Stone, in Swedenborgian correspondence, often represents "sensual truth" or truth in its lowest, most rigid form. To share secrets with the stone is to commune with a dead, unresponsive materialism.

### **4.2 The Father's Identity (First Chorus)**

The theological heart emerges in the memory of the Father:

*My father told me long ago* *I braved a bitter storm of snow* *Is that a girl I'll ever know again?* 11

This is not a question about becoming someone new. It is a question about **recovery of what was already given**. The Father (corresponding to Divine Good) had already told her who she was: brave, capable of enduring the storm. The identity was bestowed, not invented. The question—"Is that a girl I'll ever know again?"—frames the spiritual problem as **estrangement from an original state** rather than aspiration toward a novel one. This aligns precisely with Swedenborg's doctrine of **Remains**: the states of innocence and truth implanted in childhood by the Lord, preserved in the interior memory, waiting to be reactivated in the process of regeneration.3

The chorus continues:

*I'm waiting on a wish* *Beneath a thousand treetops* *And as the silver sky stops* *I send a whisper to the water* 5

The wish is sent outward—"to the water" (truth in correspondences). It is not an echo chamber. It seeks response from beyond.

*Hoping somehow, some way* *I'll become my father's daughter* 5

This is the critical phrase. Not "my own person." Not "a star." Not "who I want to be." **Her Father's daughter.** The source of identity is external and superior. She seeks to **receive** rather than to construct. In Swedenborgian terms, the Father represents the Divine Good (Love), and the Daughter represents the Affection for Truth that seeks to be conjoined with that Good. To "become my father's daughter" is to align the self with the Divine Influx.2

*I close my eyes and see* *The girl I'm meant to be* *Is she a part of me I've yet to find?* 12

Even in self-reflection, the framing is receptive: a part of her she has "yet to find"—not yet to create, but to discover. Something already there, waiting to be uncovered.

### **4.3 The Shadow Kingdom (Verse 3\)**

*Little girl by a wild wood* *How she tries to be someone good* *But in the shadow the kingdom's caught in* *Somehow, fairness is long forgotten* 12

The kingdom is in "shadow"—the Swedenborgian correspondence for states of falsity obscuring truth. "Fairness is long forgotten" operates on both the surface level (the Queen's obsession with beauty) and the deeper level (justice, equity, right order have been abandoned). The Queen’s song "All is Fair" redefines fairness as self-interest ("fair" as in "equitable retaliation" or the zero-sum game of the ego).1 Snow White laments the loss of the true definition of fairness—Divine Justice.

*So will she rise or bow her head?* *Will she lead or just be led?* *Is she the girl she always said she'd be?* 12

The question of agency emerges. This is not self-deification ("I will rise because I am a star"). This is the **anxiety of cooperation**: Will she act? Will she participate in her own regeneration? Or will she remain passive—the "Faith Alone" posture that Swedenborg identifies as spiritually dead?

### **4.4 The Rejection of the Echo (Bridge)**

The song's most theologically significant moment occurs in the bridge, where the text explicitly engages with the theology of *Wish*:

*They say, "All you have to do* *To make your wish come true* *Is let it echo, echo, echo, echo* *Your voice will carry through* *And bring that dream to you* *Just like an echo, echo, echo"* 5

This is the **explicit articulation of the *Wish* theology**. "They say"—the cultural voice, the studio's recent messaging, the Gnostic promise: just express yourself, let your truth resonate, the universe will manifest your desire. The echo is the self bouncing back, affirmed and amplified. It promises that the "voice will carry through" and "bring that dream to you" by sheer force of self-assertion.

And Snow White's response constitutes the **theological refutation**:

*Well, I can hear the echo loud and clear* *But I'm still waiting here* 5

The echo doesn't work. She tried it. She heard her own voice return—"loud and clear." And nothing changed. Because the echo is just her. There is no influx. No response from above. No transformation. The horizontal magic is **hollow**.

This single couplet is the hinge of the entire theological argument. It explicitly names the *Wish* formula ("let it echo") and explicitly declares its failure ("But I'm still waiting here").1 The True Wish is not the echo. The True Wish still waits—for something that must come from beyond the self.

### **4.5 The Activation of the Will (Final Chorus)**

Having rejected the false theology, the song moves toward activation:

*Waiting on a wish* *Beyond a whisper to the water* 5

"Beyond" a whisper—she is preparing to do more than pray. The movement from whisper to speech to action.

*Is it almost someday?* *Can I somehow, some way* *Learn to be my father's daughter?* 5

The verb "learn" indicates process, cooperation, effort. Not automatic self-expression. Not already being a star. **Learning** to receive the Father's identity.

*Someone who could finally start* *Start speaking with a fearless heart* *Someone who just might be brave* *Someone no one needs to save* 5

"No one needs to save" has been read as feminist self-empowerment. But in the Swedenborgian context, it means something more precise: she seeks to **cooperate** with salvation rather than passively await rescue. The doctrine that "man must act as if from himself, while acknowledging that the power is from the Lord" is central here.1 This is the Doctrine of Use—the will activated in partnership with divine truth.

But the song maintains its honesty:

*Well, I can always dream, but then* *I wake up and it's me again* *Waiting on a wish* 13

Dreams alone don't transform. Wishing without action doesn't regenerate. She is still herself—still waiting—but now waiting with awareness that something more is required. The arrival of Jonathan (God-given Truth) will complete what the wish has prepared.

## **V. Structural Restoration: The Mechanics of Grace in *Snow White***

While "Waiting on a Wish" diagnoses the problem, the narrative structure of *Snow White* (2025) provides the solution. The film restores the "Vertical" plane of existence through three primary mechanisms: the character of Jonathan, the function of the Magic Mirror, and the symbolism of the Apple Orchard.

### **5.1 Jonathan: The God-Given Truth**

The replacement of the generic "Prince Charming" with a new character named Jonathan has been a point of significant controversy. However, structurally, this character aligns with a sophisticated Swedenborgian reading of biblical typology, suggesting that the change restores a deeper spiritual meaning to the narrative.

The name Jonathan is derived from the Hebrew *Yehonatan*, meaning "**Yahweh has given**" or "**God-given**".1 In Swedenborgian exegesis, names in the Word are never arbitrary; they signify the "quality" or "essence" of the person. Jonathan represents the "**Truth of Doctrine**" or the "External Truth protecting the Church".1

In the film, Jonathan is introduced as a "**bandit**" or "thief" who operates outside the corrupt law of the Queen.1 While "thief" usually has a negative correspondence in Swedenborg (stealing merit from the Lord), there is a contextually positive sense: the "spoliation of the Egyptians." Jonathan steals from the Queen (the Proprium) to feed the poor (the Remains). He reclaims the truths and goods that have been captured by evil and applies them to good use.

Critically, Jonathan functions as a partner to Snow White rather than a savior. In the 1937 film, the Prince is a *deus ex machina* who saves a passive Snow White. In the 2025 film, Jonathan facilitates her agency. This mirrors the Swedenborgian concept of **Cooperation**, where the soul (Will/Snow White) must work with Truth (Understanding/Jonathan) to combat evil. The duet "A Hand Meets a Hand" explicitly describes this process of **Conjunction**: "A hand meets a hand / Like it found where to land / And suddenly, I've watched the world come alive".1 The union of Will and Understanding is what allows for the influx of life ("world come alive") and the restoration of the kingdom.

### **5.2 The Magic Mirror: The Ontology of Judgment**

In *Wish*, the mirrors are tools of vanity and narcissism. In *Snow White* (2025), the Magic Mirror is elevated to a site of **Ontological Judgment**. It represents "Divine Truth" or "The Word." For those full of charity like Snow White, it is affirming; for the Evil Queen, who uses it to confirm her own superiority, it becomes a site of intolerable judgment.1

The Mirror represents the "Vertical" connection to reality. It speaks an objective truth that the Queen cannot control. When the Queen attempts to shatter the Mirror in the film's climax, she is attempting to destroy Truth itself. This act creates a "rift into a **netherspace**" or dark void that consumes her.3

This imagery is strikingly Swedenborgian. Swedenborg describes Hell not as a place of external punishment, but as a state where the internal is a "void" or "abyss" because it is emptied of truths and goods. The "netherspace" behind the mirror corresponds to the internal state of the Proprium. It is a black hole of self-absorption. The fact that the Queen is consumed by the mirror is a perfect visual representation of Swedenborg’s teaching that "**Evil is its own punishment**." She turns to ash and is sucked into the void, signifying "Internal Vastation"—the total collapse of the self into its own non-existence.1 This stands in sharp contrast to *Wish*, where the villain is trapped *in* the mirror but remains intact, a static containment rather than a spiritual annihilation.

### **5.3 The Apple Orchard: The Doctrine of Use**

Perhaps the most significant addition to the 2025 film is the "**Apple Orchard backstory**," which links Snow White to the cultivation of apples and the baking of pies.1 This narrative addition realigns Snow White's "ruling love" with the **Doctrine of Use**.

By explicitly linking Snow White to the apple orchard, the filmmakers have connected her to the only explicitly Swedenborgian figure in the Disney canon: **Johnny Appleseed** (John Chapman). As depicted in the 1948 Disney film *Melody Time*, Johnny Appleseed was a missionary whose orchards were a way to prepare the spiritual "soil" of the frontier.18 His "Blessings Three"—Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree—correspond to the Swedenborgian triad of Charity, Faith, and Use (Good Works).

In *Snow White* (2025), the apple is reclaimed from its traditional symbol as the fruit of the "Fall" and realigned with "Redemption" and "Charity." Snow White bakes pies and feeds the village. She is not "fairest" because she is pretty; she is "fairest" because she is **Useful**.1 She manifests her internal love in external works. The Queen uses the apple for poison (the **Profanation of Use**), while Snow White uses it for nourishment. The orchard represents the "Kingdom of Uses," a society where every individual contributes their specific talent for the good of the whole. Snow White's desire to return to the orchard is a desire to restore this spiritual order.

Visually, the film supports this connection through the influence of **Mary Blair**, the legendary Disney artist whose work defined *Melody Time* and *Cinderella*. Blair was a known Swedenborgian sympathizer, and her aesthetic style—characterized by the use of color to externalize spiritual states—is heavily cited in the orchard scenes of the 2025 film.1 The orchard is not just a setting; it is a liturgical space where the "good of life" (charity) is practiced.

## **VI. Comparative Synthesis: The True Wish vs. The False Wish**

The divergence between these two films can be systematically mapped across key theological dimensions. This comparison reveals that *Wish* and *Snow White* (2025) operate on mutually exclusive metaphysical premises.

| Dimension | Wish (2023) | Snow White (2025) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Source of Magic** | Internal ("We are our own origin story" / Stardust) | External ("My father's daughter" / Divine Influx) |
| **Nature of Wishing** | Self-expression and validation (The Echo) | Prayer seeking transformation (The Voice) |
| **The Companion** | Silent Star (Mascot of the self) | Jonathan ("God-given" Truth) |
| **Mechanism of Power** | Horizontal (Democratic/Immanent) | Vertical (Hierarchical/Transcendent) |
| **The Problem** | Tyranny withholds self-expression | Estrangement from original identity (Remains) |
| **The Solution** | Liberation of the self (Return of the Orb) | Regeneration through alignment (Use/Orchard) |
| **The Villain's Fate** | Trapped in a Mirror (Static containment) | Consumed by the Void (Internal Vastation) |
| **Theological Framework** | Gnostic/Pantheist (Divine in matter) | Swedenborgian (Influx from the Lord) |

*Wish* locates the divine within; *Snow White* locates it above. *Wish* celebrates self-expression; *Snow White* articulates the insufficiency of the echo and the need for vertical response. *Wish* posits that the "Self" is the source of the wish; *Snow White* posits that the "Self" (The Queen) is the source of evil, and that salvation comes from aligning with an objective, external order.1

## **VII. Conclusion: The Haunting of the Studio**

The critical piece hidden in plain sight is this: "Waiting on a Wish" is a **refutation of *Wish*** embedded in the lyrics themselves. The song voices the Gnostic promise ("all you have to do is let it echo") and then declares its failure ("I can hear the echo loud and clear / But I'm still waiting here"). It moves from that refutation toward the True Wish: alignment with the Father's identity, cooperation with arriving Truth (Jonathan), and activation of the will to speak with a fearless heart.

If the Swedenborgian substrate that animated Disney's Golden Age persists as a "ghost in the machine," then *Snow White* (2025) represents that ghost reasserting itself against the studio's recent theological drift. The filmmakers—Greta Gerwig, Erin Cressida Wilson, and Marc Webb—may not be conscious Swedenborgians, but in their attempt to "honor the DNA" of the studio 1, they have reactivated the deep theological code that was written into that DNA by artists like Mary Blair and teachers like Don Graham.

The True Wish is not the wish that validates. It is the wish that transforms. It is not silent. It acts. It does not echo the self. It calls upward, toward the Father, waiting for the influx that alone can answer. And in the depths of the culture war's noise, in the hearts of those who received correspondences as children and cannot articulate why the new magic feels hollow, this wish is still waiting—waiting to be heard. *Snow White* (2025) is not a subversion of the classic; it is a restoration of its spiritual core, reminding us that the magic does not come from the "stardust" within, but from the Sun above.
