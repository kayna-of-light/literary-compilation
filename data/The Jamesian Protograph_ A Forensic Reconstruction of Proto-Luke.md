# **The Jamesian Protograph: A Forensic Reconstruction of Proto-Luke**

## **A Feasibility Study in the Recovery of the Gospel of the Poor**

### **1\. Introduction: The Synoptic Impasse and the Archeology of the Text**

The historical-critical investigation into the origins of the New Testament Gospels stands at a pivotal juncture, demanding a re-evaluation of foundational assumptions that have held sway for over a century. The dominant solution to the Synoptic Problem, the Two-Source Hypothesis (2SH), posits that the authors of Matthew and Luke independently utilized the Gospel of Mark and a hypothetical sayings source, Q (from the German *Quelle*), to construct their narratives.1 While this model has provided a stable framework for generations of exegesis, it suffers from persistent, structural anomalies that suggest it is an artificial simplification of a far more complex organic reality. The primary weakness of the 2SH remains the non-existence of Q as a physical document; despite intensive searching and reconstruction, it remains a phantom text, defined solely by the material shared by Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark. Furthermore, the 2SH struggles to account for the "Minor Agreements"—instances where Matthew and Luke, supposedly writing independently of one another, agree against Mark in wording, omission, or alteration, hinting at a literary relationship that the hypothesis explicitly denies.1

This report undertakes a rigorous feasibility study of an alternative, unified hypothesis: that the document scholars have reconstructed as "Q" was not a fragmented sayings list, but a coherent, pre-canonical gospel—a "Proto-Luke"—that served as the primary source for both Matthew and the canonical Luke. Furthermore, this investigation tests the radical proposition that this Proto-Luke was not a Pauline or Gentile creation, as tradition suggests, but a direct construct of the Jamesian Jerusalem Church, preserving the ethical rigor, poverty theology, and spiritual eschatology of the earliest Jewish followers of Jesus.1

The proposed lineage—Proto-Luke (Jamesian) \-\> Mark (Pauline Reaction) \-\> Matthew & Canonical Luke (Harmonization)—integrates the cutting-edge textual criticism of scholars such as Matthias Klinghardt and Jason BeDuhn, who argue for the priority of the gospel used by Marcion of Sinope, with the socio-historical reconstruction of the "Ebionite" or Jamesian community. If this lineage holds, it necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of the resurrection narratives. It implies that the earliest church, led by James the Just, adhered to a belief in Spiritual Resurrection (exaltation/enthronement) that was compatible with the continued existence of physical remains. Consequently, the explicit physical proofs found in the canonical Luke—the "flesh and bones" of Luke 24:39—must be viewed not as original historical memories, but as later orthodox interpolations designed to "materialize" the faith in opposition to Gnostic and Marcionite readings.1

This report will demonstrate that Marcion, traditionally vilified as the arch-heretic who mutilated the Gospel, likely possessed the unedited version of this Jamesian Proto-Luke. His "heresy" was, in fact, the preservation of an earlier, spiritual Christology that the emerging "Great Church" sought to suppress and overwrite with a physicalist, institutional theology. By triangulating the literary evidence of the Synoptic Problem, the theological profile of the Jamesian "Poor," and the text-critical variances of the Marcionite *Evangelion*, we can reconstruct the contours of the "Jamesian Protograph"—the lost gospel of the Jerusalem Pillars.1

### **2\. The Theoretical Framework for Reconstruction**

To successfully reconstruct Proto-Luke, one must first accept a paradigm shift regarding the composition of the Synoptic Gospels. The reconstruction relies on three interlocking theoretical pillars that provide the necessary leverage to separate the original strata from later accretions.

#### **2.1 Streeter’s Fundamental Insight: The Coherence of Q \+ L**

In 1924, B.H. Streeter, the father of the Four-Source Hypothesis, observed a distinct anomaly in the literary structure of the Third Gospel. Streeter proposed the existence of "Proto-Luke," arguing that the evangelist we call "Luke" did not simply weave Q and L (special Lukan material) into a Markan framework. Rather, Streeter observed a peculiar phenomenon: if one meticulously excises all the verses in Luke that are derived from Mark, the remaining material does not fall apart into a heap of fragments. Instead, it forms a continuous, coherent gospel narrative.1

Streeter argued that the evangelist possessed a complete gospel composed of Q and L (Proto-Luke) and later expanded it by inserting blocks of Markan material. In this model, Proto-Luke is the primary framework. This explains why Luke often departs from Mark’s order or omits Markan details—he is following his primary source, Proto-Luke. Streeter identified the "L" material (part of Proto-Luke) as having a distinct "Caesarean" or Palestinian flavor, unlike the Roman/Antiochian flavor of Mark. This aligns with the hypothesis that this source emanated from the Jewish-Christian heartland.5

Therefore, the First Rule of Reconstruction is the identification and excision of these secondary Markan blocks. The coherence of the remaining narrative serves as the primary validation of the reconstruction. If the removal of a Markan passage leaves a gap or a contradiction, the hypothesis fails. If, however, the removal reveals a seamless transition or resolves a narrative inconsistency (as we shall see in the case of the Nazareth pericope), the hypothesis is confirmed.1

#### **2.2 The Marcionite Control: The Evangelion as Witness**

The second pillar is the text preserved by Marcion of Sinope (c. 140 CE). The most significant breakthrough in recent years comes from the work of Matthias Klinghardt, Jason BeDuhn, and Markus Vinzent, who have revived and scientifically fortified the "Marcion Priority" hypothesis. Church Fathers like Tertullian claimed that Marcion "mutilated" Luke to create his *Evangelion*. However, computer-aided analysis of "editorial fatigue" suggests the opposite direction of dependence.1

Editorial fatigue occurs when a writer copies a source and makes small changes at the beginning of a passage but lapses back into the wording of the source as they get tired or distracted. Comparisons of Luke and Marcion show that Canonical Luke exhibits fatigue when diverging from Marcion’s text, implying that the canonical author was expanding Marcion’s shorter text, not the other way around. Furthermore, Marcion’s Gospel lacked the first two chapters of Luke (Birth of John, Birth of Jesus). Critical scholarship increasingly views Luke 1-2 as a later addition—a "Pastoral" prologue added to anchor Jesus in Old Testament history and biology, countering the "alien" Jesus of the Proto-Gospel.8

The *Evangelion* thus serves as the physical control for our reconstruction. It confirms that the earliest version of Luke lacked the Birth Narratives and the physical proofs of the resurrection, aligning perfectly with the proposed Jamesian theology. The reconstruction utilizes the Marcionite text not as a "heretical" aberration, but as a textual witness to the pre-canonical state of the Gospel.9

#### **2.3 The Jamesian/Ebionite Theological Filter**

The third pillar is the theological profile of the Jerusalem Church, or the "Ebionites" (The Poor). The earliest Jerusalem community, led by James the Just, referred to themselves as the *Ebionim* ("The Poor Ones"). This was not merely a description of economic status but a theological title. They believed that God had chosen the poor to be "rich in faith" and heirs of the Kingdom, while the wealthy were intrinsically aligned with "Mammon" and the corruption of the present age.1

This specific theology is the hallmark of the Q / Proto-Luke material, particularly in the sections that differ from Matthew. While Matthew spiritualizes the beatitudes ("Blessed are the poor *in spirit*"), Proto-Luke (and Q) preserves the raw, economic radicalism: "Blessed are you poor (*oi ptochoi*)... But woe to you who are rich (*tois plousiois*)." These "Woes to the Rich" (Luke 6:24-26) are unique to the Lukan/Proto-Lukan tradition and mirror the Epistle of James almost verbatim ("Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you" \- James 5:1).1

Reconstruction Principle: Passages that reflect a high Christology of physical substance, pro-Roman sentiment, or the specific historical details of the 70 CE siege (armies vs. desolation) are to be flagged as later redactions. Passages emphasizing poverty, the Spirit, and the "Law of Liberty" constitute the authentic Jamesian core. This triangulation of literary structure (Streeter), textual evidence (Marcion), and theological profile (James) provides a robust methodology for recovering the lost gospel.

**3\. Part I: The Galilean Ministry (The Reconstructed Text & Commentary)**

In this section, we present the reconstructed Greek text of the initial phases of the Gospel. The textual decisions are based on the excision of the Birth Narratives, the reliance on the Marcionite incipit, and the reordering of the Nazareth pericope to align with internal narrative logic.

#### **3.1 The Incipit: The Descent of the Spirit (Reconstructed Luke 3:1 \+ 4:31)**

**Rationale:** The most decisive step in reconstruction is the total excision of Luke 1 and 2\. The evidence for this is overwhelming and comes from multiple independent vectors. Marcion's *Evangelion* did not contain the birth narratives of John the Baptist or Jesus. Epiphanius explicitly notes the absence of the opening preface and the elaborate birth narratives in Marcion's text.10 Theologically, Luke 1–2 is heavily "Pastoral," focusing on priesthood (Zechariah) and Temple piety, which contradicts the Adoptionist Christology found in the baptism narrative. Linguistically, scholars have noted a sharp change in style; Luke 1:5–2:52 shifts abruptly to a "Septuagintal" style heavily imitating the Old Testament, suggesting it is a later "prequel" added to the main narrative.1

The original gospel likely began with a synchronism of political rulers, immediately followed by Jesus' appearance in Galilee. The canonical text reads: Luke 3:1 (dating) \-\> 3:21 (Baptism) \-\> 4:1 (Temptation) \-\> 4:16 (Nazareth). The reconstructed Proto-Luke, following the Marcionite witness, opens with the dating formula of Luke 3:1a and transitions directly to Luke 4:31.1

**Greek Text (Reconstructed):**

Ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τῆς ἡγεμονίας Τιβερίου Καίσαρος, ἡγεμονεύοντος Ποντίου Πιλάτου τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ τετρααρχοῦντος τῆς Γαλιλαίας Ἡρῴδου, Φιλίππου δὲ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ τετρααρχοῦντος τῆς Ἰτουραίας καὶ Τραχωνίτιδος χώρας, καὶ Λυσανίου τῆς Ἀβειληνῆς τετρααρχοῦντος, \[Luke 3:1\]

κατῆλθεν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ πόλιν τῆς Γαλιλαίας. καὶ ἦν διδάσκων αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς σάββασιν· καὶ ἐξεπλήσσοντο ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐν ἐξουσίᾳ ἦν ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ. \[Luke 4:31-32\]

**English Translation:**

*In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,*

*He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath; and they were amazed at his teaching, for his word was with authority.*

Textual Notes:  
The verb katēlthen ("he came down") in 4:31 is pivotal. In the canonical context, it refers to geographical movement from Nazareth (in the hills) down to Capernaum (by the sea). However, in the Marcionite incipit, devoid of the preceding Nazareth narrative and birth stories, katēlthen acquires a theological dimension, implying a descent from the heavenly realm directly into the historical moment defined by Tiberius and Pilate.1 This "vertical" Christology is consistent with the Marcionite view of the "Alien God" intervening in history without biological mediation. The intervening material in canonical Luke (Baptism of John, Genealogy, Temptation) is absent or radically compressed in the strictest Marcionite reconstructions, as these elements subordinate Jesus to John or link him to the Creator's lineage (Adam).1

#### **3.2 The Nazareth Pericope: The Displaced Rejection (Reconstructed Luke 4:16-30)**

**Rationale:** In canonical Luke, Jesus is rejected at Nazareth *before* he goes to Capernaum, yet the crowd refers to miracles he did in Capernaum (Luke 4:23: "Do here what we have heard you did at Capernaum"). This anachronism is a classic sign of editorial fatigue: the editor moved the story forward to programmatically define Jesus' ministry but failed to edit the dialogue which presupposes the Capernaum ministry.1 In Proto-Luke and Marcion, this incident likely occurred *after* the Capernaum ministry, resolving the narrative inconsistency.

Furthermore, the reference to "Joseph's son" (Luke 4:22) is textually disputed in the Marcionite tradition. Marcionite witnesses often lack this identification or treat it as a false assumption by the crowd which Jesus rebukes. The removal of "Is this not Joseph's son?" aligns with the anti-biological Christology of the reconstruction.

**Greek Text (Reconstructed):**

Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ναζαρά, οὗ ἦν τεθραμμένος, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν κατὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων εἰς τὴν συναγωγήν, καὶ ἀνέστη ἀναγνῶναι. \[Luke 4:16\]  
...  
καὶ πάντες ἐμαρτύρουν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐθαύμαζον ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις τῆς χάριτος τοῖς ἐκπορευομένοις ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ. \[Luke 4:22a \- omitting "Is this not Joseph's son?"\]  
...  
εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς· Πάντως ἐρεῖτέ μοι τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην· Ἰατρέ, θεράπευσον σεαυτόν· ὅσα ἠκούσαμεν γενόμενα εἰς τὴν Καφαρναοὺμ ποίησον καὶ ὧδε ἐν τῇ πατρίδι σου. \[Luke 4:23\]

**English Translation:**

And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and as was his custom, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.  
...  
And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.  
...  
And he said to them, "Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, 'Physician, heal yourself; what we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'

Textual Notes:  
The canonical phrase ouchi huios estin Iōsēph houtos ("Is this not Joseph's son?") 14 creates a jarring conflict with the crowd's "wondering at the gracious words." If they are impressed, why the skepticism? In the reconstructed text, the skepticism arises only after Jesus refuses to perform miracles, citing the proverb. This suggests the "Joseph's son" line may have been a later insertion to reassert Jesus' human lineage against Marcionite Docetism.15 By placing this pericope after Capernaum, the reference in v. 23 ("what we have heard done in Capernaum") becomes chronologically coherent.1

#### **3.3 The Call of the Disciples: The Non-Markan Vocation (Luke 5:1-11)**

**Rationale:** This narrative differs significantly from Mark 1:16–20. It includes the "miraculous catch of fish" and Peter’s confession ("Depart from me, for I am a sinful man"). Streeter identifies this as a non-Markan alternative preserved in Proto-Luke. It establishes Peter's dependence on Jesus’s power (Jamesian hierarchy) rather than the abrupt Markan calling. This story is internally coherent with the Proto-Lukan focus on the "poor" fishermen receiving abundance through obedience.1

**Greek Text:**

Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ τὸν ὄχλον ἐπικεῖσθαι αὐτῷ καὶ ἀκούειν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ἑστὼς παρὰ τὴν λίμνην Γεννησαρέτ, \[Luke 5:1\]  
...  
ἰδὼν δὲ Σίμων Πέτρος προσέπεσεν τοῖς γόνασιν Ἰησοῦ λέγων· Ἔξελθε ἀπ' ἐμοῦ, ὅτι ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλός εἰμι, κύριε. \[Luke 5:8\]  
...  
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν Σίμωνα ὁ Ἰησοῦς· Μὴ φοβοῦ· ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἀνθρώπους ἔσῃ ζωγρῶν. \[Luke 5:10b\]

**English Translation:**

Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around him and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,  
...  
But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' feet, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord\!"  
...  
And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear; from now on you will be catching men."

Textual Notes:  
The vocabulary epistata ("Master") used by Peter in v. 5 is uniquely Lukan (used 7 times, never in Mark/Matthew), confirming this as independent source material.16 The narrative arc emphasizes the divine provision for the economically destitute, a theme that resonates with the Ebionite "Gospel of the Poor."

**4\. Part II: The Ethical Core and The Travel Narrative**

This section, often called the "Central Section" or "Travel Narrative" (Luke 9:51–19:27), is the most distinctive feature of the Third Gospel. It contains almost no Markan material and consists primarily of L and Q. It represents the purest survival of the Jamesian Protograph.

#### **4.1 The Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6:20-49)**

**Rationale:** This is the foundational ethical document of the Jerusalem Church. The reconstruction must rigorously retain the "Woes to the Rich" (Luke 6:24–26). These verses are absent in Matthew and Mark but are present in canonical Luke and align perfectly with the Epistle of James.1

**Greek Text (Beatitudes and Woes):**

Καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπάρας τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ εἰς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ ἔλεγεν· Μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοί, ὅτι ὑμετέρα ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ.  
Μακάριοι οἱ πεινῶντες νῦν, ὅτι χορτασθήσεσθε.  
...  
Πλὴν οὐαὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς πλουσίοις, ὅτι ἀπέχετε τὴν παράκλησιν ὑμῶν.  
Οὐαὶ ὑμῖν, οἱ ἐμπεπλησμένοι νῦν, ὅτι πεινάσετε.

**English Translation:**

And lifting up his eyes on his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.  
Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied.  
...  
But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.  
Woe to you who are full now, for you shall hunger."

Textual Notes:  
The phrase hoi ptochoi (the poor) is absolute. The Matthean addition to pneumati ("in spirit") is widely considered a later spiritualization of the hard Ebionite teaching. Proto-Luke preserves the radical "Theology of Reversal" where economic status is the primary determinant of eschatological fate.1

#### **4.2 The Marcionite Lord's Prayer (Reconstructed Luke 11:2-4)**

**Rationale:** The reconstruction of the Lord's Prayer is critical. Marcion's version, as attested by Tertullian and medieval manuscripts (minuscules 162, 700), contained a variant petition asking for the Holy Spirit rather than the Kingdom. This aligns with the pneumatic focus of the early community. The prayer also simplifies the request for bread and clarifies the temptation clause.18

**Greek Text (Reconstructed):**

Πάτερ, ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου.  
ἐλθέτω τὸ πνεῦμά σου τὸ ἅγιον ἐφ' ἡμᾶς καὶ καθαρισάτω ἡμᾶς.  
τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δίδου ἡμῖν τὸ καθ' ἡμέραν·  
καὶ ἄφες ἡμῖν τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν, καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἀφίομεν παντὶ ὀφείλοντι ἡμῖν·  
καὶ μὴ ἄφες ἡμᾶς εἰσενεχθῆναι εἰς πειρασμόν.

**English Translation:**

Father, hallowed be thy name.  
Let thy Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us.  
Give us day by day our daily bread.  
And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.  
And do not let us be led into temptation.

Textual Notes:  
The reading elthetō to pneuma sou to hagion... ("Let thy Holy Spirit come...") is attested by Gregory of Nyssa and minuscules 162 and 700.18 This petition replaces the canonical "Thy Kingdom Come." Modern scholarship (Harnack, Roth) debates whether this was a Marcionite innovation or an original reading suppressed by later orthodoxy. Given the strong pneumatic emphasis of Proto-Luke (e.g., Jesus' first act is not baptism but Spirit-empowerment), this reading is retained as the likely original.19 The final petition uses mē aphes hēmas eisenechthēnai ("do not let us be led") rather than the active mē eisenenkēs ("lead us not"), a Marcionite distinction to avoid attributing the agency of temptation to the Good Father.4

#### **4.3 The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)**

**Rationale:** This parable functions as a fierce anti-Temple polemic. The Priest and Levite—representatives of the Temple elite and the Sadducean aristocracy—fail to keep the Law of Love because of concerns over ritual purity (contact with a corpse). The Samaritan, an outsider and theological enemy, fulfills the "Royal Law" (James 2:8). This aligns with James the Just's known opposition to the high priestly caste.1

**Greek Text:**

Σαμαρίτης δέ τις ὁδεύων ἦλθεν κατ' αὐτὸν καὶ ἰδὼν ἐσπλαγχνίσθη, \[Luke 10:33\]  
...  
τίς τούτων τῶν τριῶν πλησίον δοκεῖ σοι γεγονέναι τοῦ ἐμπεσόντος εἰς τοὺς λῃστάς; \[Luke 10:36\]

**English Translation:**

But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.  
...  
"Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"

#### **4.4 The Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31)**

**Rationale:** This pericope is the "smoking gun" of Ebionite theology. The rich man (Dives) is damned not for any specific vice or lack of faith, but simply for his state of being wealthy ("you in your lifetime received your good things"). Lazarus is saved solely for his state of poverty ("and Lazarus in like manner evil things"). The "great chasm" reflects a rigid eschatological dualism based on economic status.22

**Greek Text:**

Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος, καὶ ἐνεδιδύσκετο πορφύραν καὶ βύσσον εὐφραινόμενος καθ' ἡμέραν λαμπρῶς. \[Luke 16:19\]  
...  
ἀπέλαβες τὰ ἀγαθά σου ἐν τῇ ζωῇ σου, καὶ Λάζαρος ὁμοίως τὰ κακά· νῦν δὲ ὧδε παρακαλεῖται, σὺ δὲ ὀδυνᾶσαι. \[Luke 16:25\]

**English Translation:**

There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.  
...  
"You in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish."

Textual Notes:  
The name "Lazarus" (Eleazar) means "God helps." Some scholars suggest the rich man was originally named (perhaps a reference to Caiaphas, given the "five brothers" mention in v. 28, matching Caiaphas's brothers-in-law), but the name was suppressed.24 The reconstructed text preserves the stark economic determinism of the parable.

### ---

**5\. Part III: The Apocalypse and the Passion**

The reconstruction of the Passion Narrative is critical for dating the text and understanding the Christology of the Jamesian community.

#### **5.1 The Abomination of Desolation (Reconstructed Luke 21:20)**

**Rationale:** This verse serves as the chronometer of the reconstruction. Canonical Luke 21:20 reads "When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies" (*kykloumenēn hypo stratopedōn*), a specific reference to the Roman siege of 70 CE. This specificity marks it as a *vaticinium ex eventu* (prophecy after the fact). However, Mark 13:14 and Matthew 24:15 refer to the "Abomination of Desolation" (*bdelygma tēs erēmōseōs*), a cryptic Danielic phrase. Proto-Luke/Marcion likely preserved this vague apocalyptic warning, which functioned as the "Oracle" mentioned by Eusebius that warned the Jerusalem Church to flee to Pella *before* the siege began. A specific prophecy of "armies" would be too late to act upon (once surrounded, one cannot flee), whereas a warning of "desolation" allows for pre-emptive flight.1

**Greek Text (Restored):**

Ὅταν δὲ ἴδητε τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως ἑστὼς ὅπου οὐ δεῖ, τότε γνῶτε ὅτι ἤγγικεν ἡ ἐρήμωσις αὐτῆς. \[Composite based on Marcionite witness and Mark 13:14\]

**English Translation:**

*But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, then know that its desolation has come near.*

#### **5.2 The Eucharist: The Western Non-Interpolation (Luke 22:19-20)**

**Rationale:** The "Long Text" of the Last Supper includes the words of institution regarding the "new covenant in my blood," paralleling 1 Corinthians 11\. However, the "Western" textual witnesses (Codex Bezae D, Old Latin manuscripts) omit verses 19b–20. The "Short Text" ends with the bread and describes a meal of eschatological anticipation without the atonement theology of "blood poured out." This aligns with the Ebionite rejection of blood sacrifice and the Jamesian focus on the Kingdom meal rather than the Pauline theology of atonement.27

**Greek Text (Western Short Form):**

καὶ λαβὼν ἄρτον εὐχαριστήσας ἔκλασεν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς λέγων· Τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου. \[Luke 22:19a\]  
(Verses 19b and 20 are excised).

**English Translation:**

*And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body."*

Textual Notes:  
Westcott and Hort identified this as a "Western Non-Interpolation," arguing that the Western text preserved the original, shorter reading which was later interpolated from Paul's liturgy.27 The removal of the second cup (v. 20\) resolves the confusion of the "two cups" in the canonical text and presents a coherent Jewish fellowship meal.

#### **5.3 The Agony in the Garden (Luke 22:43-44)**

**Rationale:** The verses describing the angel strengthening Jesus and his sweat becoming like drops of blood are absent in the earliest and best manuscripts (P75, Vaticanus, Alexandrinus) and in the Marcionite text.28 These verses were likely added to counter a "docetic" or un-suffering Christ, portraying a very human Jesus in physical distress. Proto-Luke presents a Jesus who faces death with stoic resolve or spiritual confidence, consistent with the "martyr" theology of the early church.

**Action:** Verses 22:43-44 are **excised** completely from the reconstruction.

#### **5.4 The Marcionite Accusation (Luke 23:2)**

**Rationale:** In the trial before Pilate, Marcion's gospel included a specific charge against Jesus not found in the canonical text: that he was "destroying the law and the prophets." This fits the Marcionite/Proto-Lukan theme of Jesus abrogating the old order, which canonical Luke softened to "perverting our nation." This reading is attested by Epiphanius.7

**Greek Text (Restored):**

Ἤρξαντο δὲ κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ λέγοντες· Τοῦτον εὕραμεν διαστρέφοντα τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν καὶ καταλύοντα τὸν νόμον καὶ τοὺς προφήτας... \[Marcionite variant\]

**English Translation:**

*And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation and destroying the law and the prophets..."*

#### **5.5 The Death of Jesus (Luke 23:46)**

**Rationale:** Unlike Mark, where Jesus cries out in dereliction ("My God, why have you forsaken me?"), Proto-Luke presents a Jesus in communion with the Father.

**Greek Text:**

καὶ φωνήσας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν· Πάτερ, εἰς χεῖράς σου παρατίθεμαι τὸ πνεῦμά μου· τοῦτο δὲ εἰπὼν ἐξέπνευσεν. \[Luke 23:46\]

**English Translation:**

*And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit\!" And having said this, he breathed his last.*

Textual Notes:  
The verb paratithemai ("I commit/entrust") signifies a voluntary release of the spirit, fitting the pneumatic Christology where the Spirit-Christ departs the flesh before death, or simply a confident martyrdom.31

### ---

**6\. Part IV: The Resurrection and The Spiritual Body**

The final chapter contains the most significant theological alterations. Canonical Luke goes to great lengths to prove a physical resurrection ("flesh and bones," eating fish) to combat Marcionism and Docetism. The reconstruction must recover the earlier, spiritual account that aligns with Paul's *soma pneumatikon*.

#### **6.1 The Empty Tomb (Luke 24:12)**

**Rationale:** Verse 12 ("Peter rose and ran to the tomb...") is a "Western Non-Interpolation," omitted by Codex Bezae and Marcion.32 It is widely considered a later addition harmonizing with John 20:3-10. Its removal leaves the women's report unverified by male apostles in the immediate context, preserving the ambiguity of the empty tomb in the earliest tradition.

**Action:** Verse 24:12 is **excised**.

#### **6.2 The Appearance: "A Spirit does not have flesh" (Luke 24:39)**

**Rationale:** Canonical Luke 24:39 reads: "See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have." Marcion's text read differently. Tertullian indicates that Marcion’s text (or his interpretation of it) asserted: "A spirit does not have flesh and bones \[as you see I do not have\]" or simply used the verse to prove Jesus was *spirit*.3 Critical scholarship (BeDuhn, Vinzent) suggests the entire "flesh and bones" apology is a later orthodox insertion designed to crush the Gnostic/Marcionite reading of a spiritual resurrection.1

**Reconstructed Reading:**

ἴδετε τὰς χεῖράς μου καὶ τοὺς πόδας μου ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι αὐτός· \[Omit: ψηλαφήσατέ με... σάρκα καὶ ὀστέα οὐκ ἔχει...\]

**English Translation:**

*See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.* \[Omission of physical proof\].

Textual Notes:  
The removal of the command to "touch me" and the reference to "flesh and bones" restores the text to a form compatible with a visionary experience of the Exalted Lord rather than the resuscitation of a corpse. The eating of the fish (24:41-43) is also suspect and likely a later insertion.1

#### **6.3 The Ascension: Separation, Not Lift-off (Luke 24:51)**

**Rationale:** The phrase *kai anephereto eis ton ouranon* ("and was carried up into heaven") is absent in the Western text (D, it) and Sinaiticus (original hand). This is a classic Western Non-Interpolation.35 The original ending described Jesus simply "parting" (*diestē*) from them, implying a cessation of visions rather than a physical levitation.

**Greek Text (Western Short Form):**

καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εὐλογεῖν αὐτὸν αὐτοὺς διέστη ἀπ' αὐτῶν. \[Luke 24:51a\]

**English Translation:**

*And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them.*

Textual Notes:  
The removal of the physical ascension harmonizes with the lack of such a description in Matthew and Mark. It suggests the "Ascension" as a distinct event was a later theological construct developed by the author of Acts (or the final redactor of Luke-Acts).36

### **8\. Conclusion: The Rediscovered Gospel**

The forensic reconstruction of Proto-Luke reveals a document strikingly different from the canonical Gospel. Stripped of the Birth Narratives, the physical proofs of resurrection, and the post-70 redactions, the "Jamesian Protograph" emerges as a rigorous, pneumatic, and ethically radical text. It is a gospel of the "Poor" (Ebionites), where salvation is defined by the reversal of economic fortune and the reception of the Spirit, not by Temple sacrifice or Davidic lineage. This text likely served as the common ancestor of both the Marcionite *Evangelion* and the canonical Luke, capturing the diverse theological currents of the pre-70 Jerusalem Church before they were smoothed over by the emerging orthodoxy of the second century.
