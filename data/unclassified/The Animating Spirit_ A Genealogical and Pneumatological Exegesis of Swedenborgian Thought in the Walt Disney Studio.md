# **The Animating Spirit: A Genealogical and Pneumatological Exegesis of Swedenborgian Thought in the Walt Disney Studio**

## **I. Introduction: The Deliberate Selection Thesis**

The historiography of the Walt Disney Studio has traditionally operated under a presumption of benign secularism, or at most, a generalized, non-denominational Protestantism often categorized by sociologists as "Civil Religion." Within this established narrative, the studio's gravitation toward the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and Lewis Carroll is explained by simple commercial logic: these authors produced beloved, public-domain stories suitable for adaptation. The presence of spiritual motifs is typically attributed to "indirect transmission"—the idea that Disney animators, in adapting these fairy tales, inadvertently inherited their spiritual DNA without necessarily understanding or endorsing the specific theological systems that birthed them.1

**This report challenges the "indirect transmission" hypothesis with a stronger claim: the selection was deliberate.**

The Walt Disney Studio did not merely stumble upon stories that happened to contain Swedenborgian architecture. The studio actively sought out narratives whose internal logic aligned with the **Doctrine of Correspondences**—the Swedenborgian axiom that the natural world is a "theatre representative" of the spiritual world. This selection was driven by a specific technical crisis (the "Crisis of Ensoulment" in the early 1930s) that demanded stories where **internal states drive external forms**. The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and Lewis Carroll were not selected despite their theological substrate, but *because of it*. Their works provided the perfect narrative fuel for the studio's new "Action Analysis" animation engine.1

This investigation synthesizes evidence from three domains to prove the deliberate selection thesis:

1. **The Theological Architecture of the Source Material:** Demonstrating that Grimm, Andersen, and Carroll encoded Swedenborgian correspondences into their narratives (detailed in companion documents).3 4 6
2. **The Studio's Technical Needs:** Showing that the "Crisis of Ensoulment" created a precise demand for stories operating on "inner force driving outer form" logic.
3. **Evidence of Active Selection:** Documenting the studio's rejection of alternatives, its engagement with theological consultants, and its pattern of selecting specifically from Swedenborgian-adjacent authors.

### **1.1 The Crisis of Ensoulment: Why Theology Became a Technical Necessity**

In the 1920s, American animation was dominated by the "rubber hose" style. Characters like Felix the Cat or the early Mickey Mouse were constructed of loose, flexible tubes. They moved with a fluid, rhythmic bounce that was entertaining but fundamentally mechanical. They had no weight, no bone structure, and most importantly, **no interiority**. If a character moved, it was because the animator moved the pencil, not because the character had a thought or a feeling that *caused* the movement.1

Walt Disney realized by the early 1930s that this style had a distinct ceiling. He envisioned feature-length films that could sustain an audience's emotional investment for eighty minutes. To achieve this, his characters needed to appear to have a soul. They needed to seem **self-motivated**. This required a paradigm shift from "animating movement" to "animating intentions."2

**The Swedenborgian framework solved this problem precisely.** Emanuel Swedenborg's theology posits that life flows from the Spiritual (Cause/Will) into the Natural (Effect/Body). The body does not move itself; the spirit moves the body. Swedenborg wrote in *Arcana Coelestia*: "Action is nothing but the will flowing forth... The body is the obedience."1 For an animator facing the Crisis of Ensoulment, this is the Holy Grail: to make a drawing look alive, one must not draw the body moving; one must draw the *affection* (the spiritual cause) that results in the body moving.

This alignment of artistic necessity with theological doctrine created a **selection pressure** at the Disney Studio. The studio did not need *any* stories; it needed stories whose internal logic was already organized by the principle that **internal states manifest as external forms**. This dramatically narrowed the viable source pool—and it pointed directly at three authors whose works were architected on Swedenborgian foundations.

### **1.2 The Definition of an "Active Substrate"**

To argue that Swedenborgian thought is an "active substrate" rather than a passive influence requires a precise definition of terms. An active substrate in institutional culture is a foundational layer of philosophy or methodology that is continuously reinforced through training, hiring practices, **source selection**, and creative mandates. It is not merely a historical footnote; it is the operating system upon which the institution runs.

In the case of Disney, the Swedenborgian substrate is defined by two core theological mechanics:

1. **The Doctrine of Influx:** The belief that life flows from the Spiritual (Cause/Will) into the Natural (Effect/Body). In animation terms, this became the mandate that "The Mind is the Pilot."2
2. **The Science of Correspondences:** The belief that every natural object corresponds to a specific spiritual state or "affection." In animation terms, this manifested as the use of pathetic fallacy, where storms represent anger and animals represent human traits.1

When Walt Disney demanded that his artists "draw the force, not the form," he was demanding a shift from a materialist view of the world to a Swedenborgian one.1 Crucially, this demand also shaped **what stories the studio selected**. A story where the environment merely provides a backdrop—where nature does not respond to the protagonist's moral state—would be unusable under this paradigm. The studio needed stories where the land blooms when the rightful king returns, where the ice thaws when love is restored, where the forest grasps at those who enter with fear. The Grimms, Andersen, and Carroll provided exactly this.

## **II. The Three Literary Anchors: Evidence of Theological Architecture**

To understand why the Disney Studio gravitated toward specific literary sources, we must first establish that these sources were not merely secular fantasists, but **theological architects** who encoded the "Science of Correspondences" into their narratives. The detailed analyses are provided in companion documents; this section summarizes the key findings that support the deliberate selection thesis.

### **2.1 The Brothers Grimm: Nature as Visible Spirit**

The folklore of the Brothers Grimm (Jacob and Wilhelm) is often miscategorized as primitive or pagan. However, recent scholarship reveals that their work is deeply embedded in a philosophical framework influenced by **Emanuel Swedenborg's "Nature Philosophy,"** transmitted through the German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling.3

**The Schelling Connection:** Friedrich Schelling, heavily influenced by the Swedish mystic via Friedrich Oetinger, argued that "Nature is visible Spirit," and "Spirit is invisible Nature." This is a philosophical restatement of Swedenborg's maxim that the natural world is the "ultimate effect" of the spiritual world. The Grimms viewed folk tales (*Märchen*) not as entertainment, but as *Naturpoesie* (natural poetry)—shattered fragments of an ancient, organic revelation.3

**Why This Mattered to Disney:** The Grimm landscape is never neutral; it is a reactive mirror of the protagonist's internal state. This "animate landscape" became a cornerstone of the Disney style:

| Grimm Element | Swedenborgian Correspondence | Disney Application |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **The Forest** | The "natural man" / unregenerate intellect | *Snow White*: Trees that grasp at the fearful |
| **The Mountain** | Celestial Love / highest spiritual degree | *Sleeping Beauty*: Ascent to Aurora |
| **Thorns/Roses** | Falsities vs. Truths (state-dependent) | *Sleeping Beauty*: Hedge opens for the worthy |
| **The Well** | Entry to the Word / internal sense | *Snow White*: Wishing Well as threshold |

The Grimm stories came **pre-loaded** with correspondential logic. Disney animators did not have to invent the principle that "the forest reflects the fear of the protagonist"—it was already embedded in the source material.3

### **2.2 Hans Christian Andersen: The Celestial Botany**

If the Grimms provided the landscape, Hans Christian Andersen provided the pneumatology (the science of the soul). Andersen's specific engagement with Swedenborgian thought creates a "pneumatological scaffolding" in his tales, particularly regarding the **Doctrine of Discrete Degrees**.4

**The Ørsted Connection:** Andersen was a close friend of Hans Christian Ørsted, the physicist who discovered electromagnetism and who explicitly linked scientific laws to spiritual laws, viewing them as "thoughts of God"—a view highly compatible with Swedenborg.5

**Why This Mattered to Disney:** Andersen's stories are "ontological thrillers" about the crossing of Discrete Degrees:

| Andersen Story | Swedenborgian Doctrine | Disney Application |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **The Little Mermaid** | Soul acquiring immortality by crossing degrees | *The Little Mermaid*: Ariel's quest for legs/soul |
| **The Snow Queen** | Frozen Rational / intellect without love | *Frozen*: Elsa's ice as spiritual isolation |
| **The Fir Tree** | Profanation / celestial good subordinated to vanity | Theme of "wishing" and its proper object |
| **The Nightingale** | Natural vs. artificial truth | *Wish*: The commodification of the wish |

Andersen's stories required **no theological translation** for Disney's purposes—they were already operating on the principle that internal spiritual states determine external physical reality.4

### **2.3 Lewis Carroll: The Theology of Inversion**

The third anchor, Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), provides the structural logic for "Disney Madness." Contrary to the label of "literary nonsense," Carroll's work is a rigorous, systematic application of the **Doctrine of Correspondences** and the **Law of Inversion**.6

**The MacDonald/Maurice Connection:** Carroll's library reveals engagement with Swedenborg's works (*Heaven and Hell*, *Divine Love and Wisdom*), and his circle included Swedenborgian sympathizers like George MacDonald and F.D. Maurice. Maurice preached a theology of "states" rather than "places"—Hell as a state of selfishness, not a location—a view identical to Swedenborg's.6

**Why This Mattered to Disney:** Carroll's mechanics solved specific animation problems:

| Carroll Mechanic | Swedenborgian Doctrine | Disney Application |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Inversion** | Natural mind is inverted image of spiritual | *Alice in Wonderland*: Walking away to approach |
| **Size shifts** | Change of state = change of form | *Alice in Wonderland*: Eating/drinking as transformation |
| **Talking creatures** | Animals as correspondences of affections | All Disney films: Sidekicks as externalized traits |
| **Time distortion** | Spiritual time ≠ natural time | *Sylvie and Bruno*: The Outlandish Watch |

Carroll's "nonsense" is actually a precise map of what happens when the natural mind enters a spiritual environment. The humor arises from the friction between "Vertical" truth and "Horizontal" logic.6

## **III. Evidence of Deliberate Selection**

Having established that the three literary anchors contain Swedenborgian architecture, we now present evidence that Disney's selection of these authors was **not coincidental**.

### **3.1 The Pattern of Selection: What Disney Chose**

The studio's selection pattern reveals a consistent preference for Swedenborgian-adjacent source material:

| Era | Film | Source Author | Swedenborgian Connection |
|----|------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 1937 | *Snow White* | Brothers Grimm | Schelling/Naturphilosophie |
| 1940 | *Pinocchio* | Carlo Collodi | Catholic sacramental symbolism (compatible) |
| 1950 | *Cinderella* | Charles Perrault / Grimm | Grimm version preferred |
| 1951 | *Alice in Wonderland* | Lewis Carroll | Direct Swedenborgian engagement |
| 1953 | *Peter Pan* | J.M. Barrie | Theosophical/spiritualist milieu |
| 1959 | *Sleeping Beauty* | Charles Perrault / Grimm | Medieval correspondential aesthetics |
| 1989 | *The Little Mermaid* | H.C. Andersen | Discrete Degrees doctrine |
| 1991 | *Beauty and the Beast* | Madame de Beaumont | Transformation as regeneration |
| 1992 | *Aladdin* | *1001 Nights* | Islamic mysticism (compatible) |
| 2010 | *Tangled* | Brothers Grimm | Rapunzel as correspondential narrative |
| 2013 | *Frozen* | H.C. Andersen | *The Snow Queen* |

**The consistency is striking.** Across 75+ years, the studio returned repeatedly to Grimm, Andersen, and Carroll—and when selecting from other traditions, chose stories operating on similar internal-state-drives-external-form logic.

### **3.2 The Pattern of Rejection: What Disney Did Not Choose**

Equally revealing is what the studio **rejected** or abandoned:

| Rejected Project | Author/Source | Why It Failed |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| *Don Quixote* | Cervantes | Satirical/ironic; no animate landscape |
| *Chanticleer* (abandoned 1940s, 1990s) | Chaucer / Rostand | Allegorical but lacks organic correspondence |
| *The Odyssey* | Homer | Epic structure; environment as obstacle, not mirror |
| *Mort* (abandoned) | Terry Pratchett | Satirical; no genuine spiritual stakes |

The rejected projects share a common feature: their environments are **neutral backdrops** rather than moral mirrors. *Don Quixote* operates on irony—the gap between perception and reality—rather than correspondence. *The Odyssey* treats landscape as obstacle course, not as state-responsive. These stories are unusable under the "Action Analysis" paradigm because they do not permit the animator to draw "inner force driving outer form."

### **3.3 The Appleseed Pivot: Direct Evidence of Theological Consultation**

The most explicit evidence of deliberate theological engagement comes from the production of *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* (1948). This production proves the studio was capable of handling Swedenborgian doctrine with **precision and intent**.2

**The Murdoch-Adelquist Correspondence:** Florence Murdoch, librarian of the Cincinnati Church of the New Jerusalem and custodian of a major Johnny Appleseed archive, wrote to the studio concerned about the depiction of Chapman's guardian angel. Hal Adelquist, Story Department Manager, replied personally:

> "We trust that after you have viewed the picture you will agree that we have treated the angel with sincere respect... [we] researched the real life character extensively."2

It is **impossible** to research John Chapman "extensively" without encountering his defining characteristic: his zeal for the New Church. Chapman did not just plant trees; he planted Swedenborgian societies. He tore pages out of *Heaven and Hell* to leave with settlers. Adelquist's defense proves the studio **knew** who Chapman was. They were not ignorant of his sectarian ties; they were managing them.

**The "Blessings Three" Encryption:** The film's theme song encodes Swedenborgian soteriology in plain sight:

> "He left his blessings three: Love, and Faith, and the Apple Tree."

| Element | Swedenborgian Meaning |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Love** | The Will (Spiritual Cause) |
| **Faith** | The Understanding (Intellectual Form) |
| **The Apple Tree** | Works/Use (Natural Manifestation) |

This is the Swedenborgian rejection of "Faith Alone" (*Sola Fide*)—salvation requires the union of Charity (Love) and Faith (Truth), issuing forth in Good Works.2 The songwriters (likely guided by consultants like Carl Carmer, the "Folklore Consultant" who specialized in the esoteric history of the "Burned-Over District") preserved the structural core of Swedenborgian soteriology.

### **3.4 The Carl Carmer Connection: The Expert Consultant**

Carl Carmer (1893–1976), credited as "Folklore Consultant" on *Melody Time* and *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow*, was not a writer of children's books. He was a serious historian of the "Burned-Over District"—the region of upstate New York that birthed Mormonism, Spiritualism, and the American stronghold of Swedenborgianism.2

When Walt Disney hired Carmer, he was hiring a **specialist in American esoteric history**. This supports the hypothesis of "Active Seeking." Walt wanted the "real stuff"—the deep, weird, spiritual history of America—because he knew it provided the narrative weight that simple gags could not. Carmer's role ensures that the Swedenborgian elements in *Melody Time* were not accidental residue, but **curated content**.

## **IV. The Transmission Infrastructure: Pedagogy and Personnel**

The deliberate selection of Swedenborgian source material was reinforced by a studio infrastructure that could **receive and amplify** this content. This infrastructure had two components: the "Action Analysis" pedagogy instituted by Don Graham, and the strategic employment of personnel with direct ties to Swedenborgian thought. (Detailed personnel analysis is provided in the companion document *The Carriers of the Invisible*.8)

### **4.1 Action Analysis: The Pedagogy of Influx**

In 1932, Walt Disney hired **Don Graham** to train his animators. Graham instituted a pedagogy known as "Action Analysis," which became the seminary for the Disney religion of movement.1

**The Core Principle:** Graham taught that the animator must not draw the thing, but the *force driving the thing*. In his lecture notes from 1937, he speaks of the "inner force" that dictates the "outer form." A famous memo from Walt Disney to Graham in 1935 explicitly articulates this philosophy:

> "The driving force behind the action is the mood, the personality, the attitude of the character—or all three. Therefore the mind is the pilot."2

This pedagogy is a **secularized reinstatement** of Swedenborg's Doctrine of Influx. It posits that the physical world (the drawing) is merely the "obedience" of the spiritual world (the character's intent). The animator does not manipulate the body; the animator manipulates the *will*, and the body follows.

**Why This Created Selection Pressure:** Once the studio was trained to think correspondentially—to see the material world as a shell for spiritual energies—it **required** stories that operated on the same logic. A story where the environment is neutral, where nature does not respond to the protagonist's state, would be **unusable** under Action Analysis. The pedagogy created demand for Grimm, Andersen, and Carroll.

### **4.2 Key Personnel: The Carriers of Transmission**

The transmission was further secured by personnel who had direct ties to Swedenborgian thought.8 Key figures include:

| Personnel | Role | Swedenborgian Connection |
|-----------|------|-------------------------|
| **Retta Scott** | First credited female animator (*Bambi*) | Married into the Worcester family—the most prominent Swedenborgian dynasty in America |
| **Mary Blair** | Art Supervisor (*Johnny Appleseed*, *Alice*, *Cinderella*) | Confirmed member of the Swedenborgian Church (Wayfarers Chapel, 1974); lifelong associate |
| **Carl Carmer** | Folklore Consultant | Specialist in Burned-Over District esoteric history |
| **Florence Murdoch** | External Consultant | Swedenborgian Church librarian; Chapman archive custodian |
| **Walt Stanchfield** | Training Program Director (1970s-80s) | Taught "draw verbs, not nouns"—transmitted Action Analysis to the Renaissance generation |
| **Glen Keane** | Lead Animator (*Little Mermaid*, *Beast*, *Rapunzel*) | Stanchfield protégé; speaks of "drawing the soul" |

These personnel ensured that the theological substrate remained active across generations. The "Carriers" did not merely execute assigned tasks; they **selected, shaped, and transmitted** the Swedenborgian vision.8

---

## **V. The Modern Era: Divergence and Restoration**

The deliberate selection thesis is further validated by examining what happens when the studio **departs** from Swedenborgian principles—and what happens when it **returns**.

### **5.1 The Divergence: *Wish* (2023) as Anti-Swedenborgian Text**

The 2023 centennial film *Wish* represents a significant theological divergence. Contrary to the earlier films where the spiritual world (Cause) governed the natural world (Effect), *Wish* inverts the relationship:9

| Swedenborgian Principle | *Wish*'s Inversion |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| **The Ruling Love is internal** | The "wish" is depicted as an external object (blue orb) that can be extracted and hoarded |
| **Life flows from the Divine into the human** | "We are our own stars"—power originates within the self |
| **Providence governs** | The self replaces Providence (narcissistic autonomy) |

Critics within the framework have noted that *Wish* commits the heresy of "commodifying the Ruling Love" and "deifying the Proprium."9 It is, structurally, the first anti-Swedenborgian Disney film—and it underperformed critically and commercially.

### **5.2 The Restoration: *Snow White* (2025) as Return to Use**

The 2025 live-action *Snow White* functions as a corrective counter-narrative, returning the studio to the orthodox Swedenborgianism of the 1940s. It is structurally isomorphic to *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* (1948):10

| *Johnny Appleseed* (1948) | *Snow White* (2025) |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Salvation through labor (planting trees) | Salvation through labor (leading the dwarfs/bandits) |
| Rejection of "Faith Alone" | The Prince is not the savior |
| "Love, Faith, and the Apple Tree" | Active preparation ("Waiting on a Wish") |
| The pioneer as spiritual agent | The princess as spiritual agent |

By transforming the princess from a passive recipient of grace into an active agent of order ("The Leader"), Disney has resurrected the spirit of Johnny Appleseed. Snow White does not just "wish"; she *works*. In doing so, she validates the core Swedenborgian tenet that "Charity and Faith make one in Good Works."10

---

## **VI. Conclusion: The Secular New Jerusalem**

The evidence amassed from the studio's selection patterns, archival correspondence, pedagogical methods, and personnel networks leads to an inescapable conclusion: **The Walt Disney Studio did not merely adapt fairy tales; it adapted the "Theological Physics" that structured them.**

**First-Order Insight:** The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and Lewis Carroll were not selected for their popularity alone. They were selected because their narrative logic (Correspondence, Influx, Inversion) was compatible with the technical needs of "Action Analysis." The "Crisis of Ensoulment" demanded a theology of "Inner Force," and these authors provided it.

**Second-Order Insight:** The selection was reinforced by deliberate consultation (Murdoch, Carmer), strategic hiring (Scott, Blair), and institutionalized pedagogy (Graham, Stanchfield). The studio built an infrastructure that could receive, process, and amplify Swedenborgian content.

**Third-Order Insight:** When the studio departed from these principles (*Wish*), it produced work that is structurally incoherent and commercially weaker. When it returned to them (*Snow White* 2025), it restored the "Kingdom of Uses." The pattern validates the deliberate selection thesis: the Swedenborgian substrate is not incidental—it is **constitutive** of the Disney magic.

### **Summary of Transmission Vectors**

| Vector Type | Anchors / Agents | Swedenborgian Concept Transmitted | Disney Manifestation |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Literary Anchor** | **Brothers Grimm** | Nature as "Visible Spirit"; Landscape as Moral Mirror | *Snow White*: The living forest; *Sleeping Beauty*: Thorns vs. Flowers |
| **Literary Anchor** | **H.C. Andersen** | Discrete Degrees; The Frozen Rational; Celestial Botany | *The Little Mermaid*: Soul quest; *Frozen*: Ice vs. Love; *Tangled*: Hair/Truth |
| **Literary Anchor** | **Lewis Carroll** | Inversion; The Grand Man; Spiritual Cause vs. Natural Effect | *Alice in Wonderland*: Visual logic of the "Mad" world |
| **Pedagogy** | **Don Graham** | **Doctrine of Influx** ("Inner Force driving Outer Form") | **Action Analysis**: "The Mind is the Pilot"; *Fantasia*: Animating music as force |
| **Consultation** | **Carl Carmer / Florence Murdoch** | Burned-Over District esotericism; Chapman's mission | *Johnny Appleseed*: "Blessings Three" |
| **Personnel** | **Retta Scott / Mary Blair** | Worcester dynasty; Church membership | *Bambi*: Animals as affections; *Alice*: Color as spiritual state |
| **Divergence** | **Modern "Culture Thrust"** | **Proprium / Narcissism** (Anti-Influx) | ***Wish***: The Wish as commodity; Self-origin of power |
| **Restoration** | ***Snow White* (2025)** | **Doctrine of Use**; Rejection of "Faith Alone" | The Princess as "Leader" (Worker); *Johnny Appleseed* parallel |

The transmission is complete. The "Invisible Influx" that began in 18th-century Stockholm found its most effective amplifier in 20th-century Burbank—not by accident, but by **deliberate selection**.
