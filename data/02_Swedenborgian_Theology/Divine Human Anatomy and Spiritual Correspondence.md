# **The Grand Man: An Exhaustive Anatomical Atlas of the Divine Human**

## **I. Introduction: The Ontological Architecture of Heaven**

The theological cosmology of Emanuel Swedenborg, as revealed in his voluminous *Arcana Coelestia*, *Spiritual Diary* (*Experientiae Spirituales*), and *Heaven and Hell*, presents a radical restructuring of metaphysical space. It posits that the universal heaven—the aggregate of all regenerate souls, angels, and spirits—is not a formless ethereal realm but an organized, organic entity structured in the absolute image of a human body. This structure is termed the *Maximus Homo* (Grand Man) or the Divine Human. This concept is not merely metaphorical; it is the fundamental ontological principle of the spiritual universe. The human form is the form of the Divine itself, and consequently, the form of all creation that receives Divine life.1

The research materials drawn from Swedenborg’s private manuscripts and analyses of his symbolic roles reveal that this Grand Man functions as a "Divine Anatomy." Every specific organ, viscus, member, tissue, and fluid in the physical human body acts as a correspondent to a specific spiritual community or "province" in the heavens. These provinces are distinguished not by spatial location in a Cartesian sense, but by their "use" or function within the spiritual economy. The physiological operations of the body—digestion, respiration, circulation, sensation, and excretion—are the physical manifestations of spiritual causes enacted by these societies.1

The premise of this report is to provide an exhaustive mapping of this Divine Anatomy. We shall traverse the spiritual physiology from the cerebral heights of the celestial kingdom to the ultimate extremities of the skin and bones. By synthesizing Swedenborg’s direct experiential reports—where he converses with spirits of the liver, feels the pulsation of the dura mater, or observes the gnashing teeth of the sensual—we construct a complete anatomical atlas of the spiritual world. This atlas serves not only as a map of the afterlife but as a diagram of the human soul itself, for the microcosm (the individual) is created in the exact image of the macrocosm (the Grand Man).2

### **The Doctrine of Correspondence and the Human Form**

The mechanism that binds the physical body to the Grand Man is "correspondence." This is the relationship between a spiritual cause and its natural effect. The physical eye sees because it corresponds to the spiritual understanding; the heart beats because it corresponds to the influx of Divine Love. Swedenborg asserts that the ancients possessed this science of correspondences, reading the human body and nature as a book of Divine Truth. In the Grand Man, this means that a society of angels does not merely "represent" the liver; they *are* the liver of heaven. They perform the spiritual function of purification and assimilation of good, which manifests in the physical world as hepatic function.1

The Grand Man is organized into three distinct heavens, mirroring the anatomical divisions of the human form:

1. **The Head:** Corresponds to the Third or Celestial Heaven (Highest).  
2. **The Body (Thorax to Loins):** Corresponds to the Second or Spiritual Heaven (Middle).  
3. **The Extremities (Feet/Arms):** Corresponds to the First or Natural Heaven (Lowest).2

This report follows this vertical descent, analyzing the intricate systems that constitute the Divine Body.

**II. The Cephalic Province: The Heavens of the Head**

The head, as the seat of the brain and the organs of sense, corresponds to the highest and most interior principles of the Divine Human. It is the sanctuary of the central ruling faculties: the will and the understanding, which Swedenborg correlates with the two primary structures of the brain, the cerebrum and the cerebellum. The societies composing the province of the head are in the most intelligent and wise states, receiving influx directly from the Lord.1

### **A. The Brain: The Bicameral Mind of Heaven**

The subdivision of the brain into two hemispheres and two distinct organs (cerebrum and cerebellum) serves as the anatomical basis for the dual kingdom theory of heaven.

#### **1\. The Cerebrum: The Seat of Will and Intellect**

The cerebrum, particularly the right and left hemispheres, corresponds to the intricate interplay of the will and the intellect. While general Swedenborgian doctrine often associates the right with the will (good) and the left with the understanding (truth), the *Spiritual Diary* reveals a nuanced, cross-lateral correspondence.1

* **The Left Hemisphere (Intellectual Province):** Spirits acting upon the left side of the brain are associated with the intellectual principle. Swedenborg notes that the "intellectuals" operate upon the left side of the face and brain, signifying their dedication to the truths of faith. These angels are characterized by their light; they perceive truth clearly and communicate it. They correspond to the spiritual kingdom's presence within the celestial sphere.1  
* **The Right Hemisphere (Voluntary Province):** The right hemisphere is the receptacle of the affections or the will. However, due to the decussation (crossing) of nerves—a physiological fact Swedenborg incorporated into his theology—the operation of the right brain often manifests in the left side of the body, and vice versa. This province is inhabited by angels who are in the good of love. They do not reason about faith; they perceive it through love.1  
* **Cortical Substance:** Swedenborg identifies the cortical substance (the grey matter) as the "firsts" or the most interior part of the human organic form. In the Grand Man, this corresponds to the "Celestial of the Celestial"—the highest sub-degree of heaven where the soul first resides and acts upon the body. It is the immediate receptacle of Divine Influx.  
* **Medullary Substance:** This consists of the fibers originating from the cortical substance. It acts as a conduit or "pathway" for the spiritual forces (the "animal spirits" or soul) to flow from the cortex down into the body. In the Grand Man, the medullary substance corresponds to the angelic messengers and forces that transmit Divine Will into the lower heavens.  
* **The Isthmus:** Specifically referring to the *isthmus* of the brain (such as the pons or the connections between brain regions), Swedenborg describes it as a critical junction. Spirits often associate with these "isthmuses" because they represent points of transition or communication between different states of the mind or between the internal and external man. Blockages here correspond to a disruption in the flow between the spiritual and natural minds.  
* **Spiritual Operation:** Swedenborg describes spirits stationed about the cerebrum who act by a "gentle undulation." This movement mimics the expansion and contraction of the brain (its animation), which corresponds to the rhythmical influx of celestial wisdom. When the cerebrum is open to the Lord, the angels of this province are in the peace of wisdom, perceiving truths not by reasoning but by an internal light.1

#### **2\. The Cerebellum: The Sanctuary of Involuntary Love**

Situated at the back of the head (occiput), the cerebellum corresponds to the involuntary or unconscious will—the deepest loves that sustain life without man’s conscious interference.

* **The Spirits of the Occiput:** The celestial communities of the cerebellum act from a "fear of the Lord" and a spontaneous love, rather than from intellectual calculation. They represent a state of integrity where the will and understanding are united, unlike the spirits of the cerebrum who may be divided. Swedenborg notes that when spirits operate in the occipital region, they relate to a person's deepest affections and the "will".  
* **Spirits of Mars:** Swedenborg describes specific experiences where spirits from the planet Mars would "draw back" the superior frontal part of his head toward the occiput. This representative action signified that their thought was derived from their **will** (the cerebellum) rather than just the intellect (the cerebrum). This implies that the inhabitants of that spiritual province act from a state of love or fear of the Lord rather than mere intellectual reasoning.  
* **Vital Function:** The societies of the cerebellum watch over the involuntary functions of the Grand Man—the beating of the heart and the spontaneous operations of the viscera—ensuring that the "voluntary" or self-will of the individual does not destroy the vital economy of the whole. They are the guardians of the fundamental life force.1

#### **3\. The Meninges: The Protective Membranes**

The membranes covering the brain correspond to spiritual skins or protective truths that guard the interior sanctity of the brain.

* **Dura Mater (The Hard Mother):** This tough outer membrane corresponds to the province of **external piety**. Spirits belonging to the Dura Mater are those who, during their life in the world, thought about spiritual things from a natural perspective. They may have been rigid in their beliefs, yet they serve a necessary defensive function. They act as a "hard" protective shield for the interior truths of the brain, preventing the influx of the hells from directly assaulting the celestial centers. Their spiritual quality is steadfastness and protection.1  
* **Pia Mater (The Gentle Mother):** This delicate inner membrane, which closely adheres to the brain's contours, corresponds to the province of **modest credulity**. These spirits are described as innocent, simple, and yielding. They do not possess high wisdom themselves but are willing to believe and serve. They act as intermediates that conduct spiritual truth into the brain’s interiors, representing a state of gentle receptivity and humility.1

### **B. The Cranial Boundary: Skull and Hair**

The boundary between the internal heavens of the head and the external world is marked by the skull and its covering.

#### **1\. The Skull (Cranium) and Sutures**

The skull corresponds to the most external, rigid truths—the scientifics and literal facts that contain and support the spiritual mind.

* **Spirits of the Cranium:** These spirits are often in extremely external states, hardened against interior truths. However, they provide necessary containment for the Grand Man, just as the skull protects the brain. Swedenborg reports that "hypocrites" or those who were hardened in falsity can inflict pain on the part of the skull corresponding to their specific nature. In states of spiritual combat, evil spirits attempt to "rush into the cranium" to destroy the rational faculty; thus, the integrity of the skull spirits is vital for mental stability.  
* **The Sutures:** The fibrous joints between the bones of the cranium correspond to specific groups of spirits who represent the connection points or articulations between these external protective truths. They facilitate the "breathing" of the skull (its correspondence to the brain's animation) and maintain the flexibility of the external mind.

#### **2\. The Hair: The Ultimate of Ultimates**

Rooted in the skin of the skull, hair corresponds to the "ultimate of ultimates"—the most external natural truths, such as the literal sense of the Word.

* **Spiritual Meaning:** "Hair like women" signifies the affection of truth in the natural degree. "Shaggy" or deformed hair signifies a disorderly natural state. Swedenborg frequently cites the correspondence of Samson’s hair to the power of the literal sense of the Word. The strength of the Grand Man in ultimates depends on the integrity of this "hair"—the adherence to the written Word. Spirits who appear "hairy" or rise from the deep like "corporeal hair" are those who were wholly immersed in the life of the body; they represent raw, natural vitality that must be combed and ordered by spiritual truth.  
* **Baldness:** Corresponds to a **lack of external truth** or the absence of the natural "ultimate" that clothes inner truths. In the spiritual world, baldness signifies a state of deprivation regarding external knowledge or the literal sense of the Word, leaving the interior mind exposed and vulnerable.

### **C. The Facial Province: The Sensorium of the Grand Man**

The face is the "index of the mind." In the Grand Man, the organs of the face correspond to the various modes of perception and reception of the Divine.1

#### **1\. The Forehead: Celestial Love**

The forehead corresponds to the province of **celestial love** and the good of love. Spirits associated with the forehead are in the highest state of love to the Lord. This region is the external manifestation of the will's highest affections. When angels are seen with light beaming from their foreheads, it signifies their reception of Divine Wisdom through Love.

#### **2\. The Eyes: Intelligence and Faith**

The eyes correspond to the understanding and to intelligence. The sight of the eye is the correspondence of the sight of the spirit (faith).

* **Right vs. Left Eye:** The right eye corresponds to the **affection of truth** (associated with the celestial kingdom—seeing because one loves). The left eye corresponds to the **knowledge of truth** (associated with the spiritual kingdom—seeing to understand).  
* **Interior Angels:** "Interior angels" belong to the province of the eye because the eye "is in the face and proceeds from the brain." The paradisal heavens, where the most beautiful visual representations occur, are situated in the plane of the eye, signifying the beauty of wisdom.1  
* **Tears:** Tears correspond to the "desire for truth" or "grief over the lack of truth." They are associated with the eyes (understanding) and represent the emotional response of the understanding when it is touched by the influx of heaven or the realization of spiritual states.

#### **3\. The Ears: Obedience and Attention**

The ears correspond to obedience and hearkening.

* **Spirits of the Ear:** Spirits in the province of the ear are in a life of simple obedience. They do not reason about truths; they simply hear and obey. They are termed "obediences."  
* **Interior Chambers:** True spirits of the ear reside in the "interior chambers" of the hearing, corresponding to the intricate internal anatomy (cochlea, labyrinth). These spirits perceive the interior will of God contained within His words.1  
* **Auricular Spirits:** Swedenborg distinguishes "auricular spirits" from those of the hearing proper. These are whisperers who attempt to secretly infuse evils into the mind, lurking in the outer vestibules of the ear.1

#### **4\. The Nose: Perception and Spheres**

The nose corresponds to perception. Just as the nose detects odors which represent the "spheres" of spirits, so the spiritual nose perceives the moral quality of good and truth.

* **Spiritual Spheres (Odors):** Every spirit and angel is surrounded by a "sphere" of their own affections and thoughts, which is perceived in the spiritual world as a specific smell. Spheres of charity and faith are perceived as fragrant (lilies, spices), while spheres of evil and falsity are perceived as foul (cadavers, sulfur). The nose allows spirits to "test" the quality of a newcomer immediately.  
* **Interiors of the Nostrils:** Those relating to the interiors of the nostrils possess a perfect state of perception. They can instantly sense the quality of a spirit, discerning good from evil as the nose discerns sweet from foul.1  
* **Mucous Membrane:** Spirits relating to the "mucous membrane" are those who are dull in perception or who "take up" scandals and falsities (pituitary phlegm), trapping impurities before they enter the lungs of the mind.  
* **Cartilaginous Faces (Spirits of the Moon):** Swedenborg describes the "Spirits of the Moon" as corresponding to the **scutiform or xiphoid cartilage**. Their faces are described as being composed of cartilage, similar to the human nose, rather than flesh. Because of this, they do not speak from the lungs but produce a loud, thundering voice by belching air from the abdomen. This corresponds to a state where truth is not intellectual (pulmonary) but natural and slightly obscure, yet robust.

#### **5\. The Mouth, Tongue, and Teeth: Instruction and Doctrine**

This region corresponds to the reception of spiritual food (instruction) and the expression of thought (speech).

* **The Lips:** Correspond to **doctrine** and the clarity of speech. Spirits of the lips are eloquent and serve to communicate truths clearly. They frame the "mouth" of the church.1  
* **The Tongue:** Corresponds to the **affection of truth** (speech) and the perception of the good of nourishment (taste). It is the "courtyard" to both the lungs (spiritual) and stomach (natural). Spirits here love to talk, teach, and taste the quality of goods.1  
* **The Palate:** Corresponds to the **desire for knowing and perceiving truths**. Just as the palate tastes food, this spiritual correspondence relates to the "taste" for spiritual nourishment.  
* **The Teeth:** Correspond to the **sensual degree**—the hardest, most external truths used to grind down spiritual food.  
  * **Incisors:** Correspond to the **inner natural** level. They are associated with the first stage of taking in truths (cutting/biting).  
  * **Molars:** Correspond to the **outer natural** level. They represent the further processing or "grinding" of truths so they can be integrated into life.  
  * **Gnashing of Teeth:** Represents the disputations of purely natural spirits who argue from fallacies. Their "truth" is hard and lacerating. Toothache is often caused by "hypocritical" spirits who are essentially "decay" in the mouth of the Grand Man.1  
* **The Gums:** Spirits who correspond to the gums are those who have a general and somewhat "undistinguished" faith; they serve as a foundation for more distinct spiritual truths (teeth).  
* **Saliva:** Represents a transitional or "mediating" state. It corresponds to the **desire for knowledge** and spirits who are receiving truths but have not yet fully internalized them. It prepares "spiritual food" for digestion.

#### **6\. The Cheeks, Chin, and Beard**

* **Cheeks:** Represent the **perception of truth** and its outer manifestation. They are linked to the beauty of spiritual life as it appears in the external form.  
* **Chin:** Corresponds to the **lowest or ultimate part of the intellectual life**. It represents the grounding of spiritual principles in the most external aspects of a person's life.  
* **Beard:** Specifically corresponds to **ultimate truth** or the "natural" in its final, most external form. Those who correspond to the beard are associated with the most external or literal aspects of the Word, bordering on the sensual but retaining dignity.

**III. The Cervical Region: The Pathway of Communication**

The neck (cervix) corresponds to the **communication and conjunction** between the "head" (celestial things/heavens) and the "body" (spiritual and natural things). It represents the influx of Divine Wisdom into the life of the spirit. Without this conjunction, the body (natural man) would be lifeless.

### **A. The Passageways of Life**

* **Larynx and Trachea:** These represent the initial pathways of communication and the introductory stages of the "breath of life" or spiritual truth entering the Grand Man.  
  * **The Larynx:** As the organ of sound, it corresponds to the **reception and beginning of the expression of truths**. It signifies the point where the internal thought of the head becomes the external speech of the body.  
  * **The Trachea:** As a conduit for air, it corresponds to the **communication of spiritual life** (breath) into the lower regions of the mind and body.  
* **Esophagus:** This organ is associated with the **reception of "nourishment"** (spiritual goods and truths). It corresponds to the initial desire or appetite for learning and incorporating new spiritual concepts before they are "digested" in the stomach.

### **B. The Glandular and Vascular Regulators**

* **Thyroid Gland:** In Swedenborg's system, glands often serve as "purifiers" or "balancers." The thyroid corresponds to the **refinement of the affections** that give tone and quality to one's speech and expression. It regulates the "voice" of the Grand Man.  
* **Jugular Veins:** These vessels carry blood back from the head. Spiritually, they correspond to the **return of used or processed thoughts and perceptions** back into the general circulation of the life of the spirit to be renewed.

### **C. The Cervical Spine**

* **Cervical Vertebrae:** These correspond to the spirits who facilitate the **influx** of divine love and wisdom from the head into the body. They act as the structural support for the communication between the celestial and spiritual kingdoms.

## ---

**IV. The Thoracic Province: The Kingdom of the Heart and Lungs**

The chest (thorax) contains the vital organs that define the two universal kingdoms of heaven: the Celestial (Heart) and the Spiritual (Lungs). This region corresponds to the "Internal Man" distinct from the "Head" (Inmost) and the "Abdomen" (External/Purifying).1

### **A. The Heart: The Celestial Kingdom (Love)**

The heart corresponds to **Divine Love** and the **will**.

* **Celestial Angels:** Angels of the heart province are in love to the Lord. They do not reason about faith; they live it. They govern the involuntary vital motions of the Grand Man, ensuring that love flows to every member.  
* **Pulse:** The "pulsation" of the heart is the rhythmic influx of Divine Love. Swedenborg felt this spiritual pulse and noted its variation with the state of spirits.1  
* **Pericardium:** The covering of the heart corresponds to spirits who **protect the celestial love** from profanation. They act as a sacred boundary. "Sores" on the pericardium correspond to those who use artifices and lies, threatening the sanctity of the heart.

### **B. The Lungs: The Spiritual Kingdom (Wisdom)**

The lungs correspond to **Divine Wisdom** and the **understanding**.

* **Spiritual Angels:** Angels of the lungs are in the love of the neighbor and the light of faith. They provide the "atmosphere" (truth) that purifies the blood (love).  
* **Respiration:** Spiritual respiration corresponds to thought. A "tacit" respiration indicates deep, interior thought, while a labored breath indicates conflict with falsity. Swedenborg observed that his own respiration would change during intercourse with spirits.1  
* **The Bronchi:** Represent the further specification and distribution of spiritual truths into various angelic societies.  
* **Pulmonary Vessels:** These represent the intricate intersection where the "will" (blood/heart) meets the "understanding" (air/lungs). In Swedenborg’s view, the pulmonary vessels are the site of the **"marriage" between good and truth**, where spiritual life is purified and vitalized.  
* **The Pleura:** The membrane covering the lungs corresponds to those in a more external state of the spiritual kingdom. They protect the interior truths. Tubercles on the pleura represent falsified truths blocking the breath of heaven.

### **C. The Thoracic Cage and Defenses**

* **Sternum (Breastbone):** Corresponds to spirits in a state of **charity** and spiritual love. They provide central support and protection for the heart of the Grand Man.  
* **Ribs:** Correspond to **protective truths** (natural truths) that support the internal vitals. They represent truths that serve the natural man but are subservient to spiritual principles, acting as a cage against external assault.  
* **Mediastinum:** This structure corresponds to the **balancing and mediating** functions between the heart (will) and the lungs (understanding). Spirits here ensure the equilibrium between love and wisdom is maintained.  
* **Xiphoid Cartilage:** Corresponds to the **Spirits of the Moon**. These spirits act as a fulcrum for abdominal muscles and protect the vital centers. They are characterized by their cartilaginous nature and "thundering" abdominal speech.

### **D. The Nutritive and Instructive Centers**

* **Mammillae (Breasts):** Correspond to the **celestial kingdom's affection of truth** and the communication of the good of love. Just as they provide nourishment in the natural world, in the Grand Man, they correspond to the nurturing and teaching aspects of spiritual love.  
* **Thymus:** Corresponds to **innocence**, particularly the protection and nurturing of initial states of innocence (childhood). In the Grand Man, it corresponds to societies that protect and nurture new angels.  
* **Thoracic Duct and Cisterna Chyli:** Swedenborg locates a specific community here, the **province of instruction**. Spirits who have been processed in the world of spirits are gathered here as "chyle"—nutrient-rich spiritual potential—waiting to be mixed with the blood (angelic life) and circulated into the Grand Man.

## ---

**V. The Abdominal Province: The Laboratory of Purification**

The abdomen is the region of digestion, corresponding to the **separation of good from evil and truth from falsity**. This province is heavily involved with the "World of Spirits," the intermediate state where souls are prepared for heaven or hell.1

### **A. The Digestive Tract: Processing Spirits**

* **Stomach:** Corresponds to the **World of Spirits** itself. Spirits of the stomach cause spiritual agitation and "anxiety" in man, functioning like the churning of food to separate the soul's intrinsic nature from external masks. This "fermentation" is necessary to break down the "food" (spirits) for assimilation.1  
* **Mesentery and Lacteals:** Correspond to the **selection and purification** of good spirits. Spirits here act as "sifters," often provoking others to test their quality. They have a strong aversion to falsity and transport "purified" spirits (chyle) toward the heart. Their behavior is transitional, ensuring only the worthy enter the bloodstream of heaven.  
* **Intestines (Colon and Rectum):** Correspond to the **hells** and the rejection of evil. Spirits here are described as "rough and ferocious," devoid of mercy. Their function is to extract the final remnants of truth from waste spirits before they are cast into the "draught" (hell). They represent the necessary "scouring" function of the Grand Man.  
  * **Anus and Sphincter:** Correspond to the **outermosts** and **containment**. They regulate the casting out of falsities and evils (feces) that are no longer useful to the Grand Man. The sphincter represents the power of control over what is rejected.

### **B. The Blood Purifiers: Liver, Pancreas, Spleen**

These organs act as "blood purifiers" for the life-current (Divine Truth) of the Grand Man.1

* **Liver:** Corresponds to the **purification of good**. Spirits in this province separate genuine good from grosser natural elements. They are gentle but effective in their sorting.1  
* **Gall Bladder and Bile:** Correspond to **bitter spirits** who love to punish and "vex." The bile represents the "bitter truths" used to separate falsities from good.  
  * **Cystic Duct:** The pathway for these "fault-finding" spirits to be separated/drained. Spirits here are often associated with those who lived in hatred or deceit; they serve the Grand Man by chastising others but are themselves kept separate from the vital blood.  
* **Pancreas:** Corresponds to the separation of spirits of a **specific genius**, acting on a different quality of the spiritual blood. They operate quietly to refine the spirit.1  
* **Spleen:** Corresponds to the **purification of truth** and the separation of "obsolete" elements. Swedenborg identifies spirits here who "commix profane with holy things" and suggests the spleen may deal with spirits dangerously close to profanation, isolating them to prevent damage to the whole.1

### **C. The Covering and Connection**

* **Omentum:** The fatty apron covering the intestines corresponds to spirits who are in the **good of truth** and provide a protective covering for interior processes. They assist in refining interior goods (fat) before digestion. They are external but benign, preserving heat and order.  
* **Peritoneum:** Corresponds to the **general protective membrane** of the lower spiritual functions. Spirits here maintain the boundaries of the World of Spirits.  
* **Navel (Umbilicus):** Corresponds to the **connection** between the heavens and the reception of spiritual nourishment. It represents the **equilibrium** between the celestial (upper) and natural (lower) parts of the Grand Man. It is the "knot" that ties the spiritual generations together.

## ---

**VI. The Renal and Urinary Systems: Judgment and Separation**

This entire system corresponds to the **separation of falsity from truth**, analogous to how the physical organs separate waste (urine) from the blood.1

### **A. The Organs of Judgment**

* **Kidneys:** Spirits in the province of the kidneys correspond to **exploration, chastisement, and judgment**. They love to search out faults and purify other spirits by forcing them to confront hidden evils. They are the "conscience" investigators of the Grand Man.  
* **Ureters:** The conduits for the separated falsities. Spirits here are in transit, moving from judgment to rejection.1  
* **Bladder:** Corresponds to the **temporary retention and ejection of falsity** (urine). Spirits associated with this province are often characterized as anxious, irritating, and scrutinizing, reflecting the physical pressure of the bladder. They wish to punish but are restrained until the time of expulsion.  
* **Sphincter and Urethra:** Correspond to the path of expulsion and the control over the rejection of useless things.  
* **Urine:** Corresponds to **falsities** and incorrect thoughts that are cast out from the spiritual body.

## ---

**VII. The Generative Province: The Sanctity of Creation**

The reproductive organs correspond to the highest spiritual principles: **Conjugial Love** (marriage love) and **Innocence**. This region is considered holy and is often protected from the view of other spirits.1

### **A. Male Organs: Conception of Truth**

* **Testicles and Seminal Vessels:** Correspond to the **conception of truth** and the storage of spiritual "seed" (Divine Truth). Spirits here gather knowledges (*scientia*) that are ready to be vivified by love. They represent the potential for new creation.  
* **Epididymis:** Corresponds to **intermediaries** or transmitters that transition spiritual potential into active force. They link the production of truth with its use.  
* **Vas Deferens:** Corresponds to spirits characterized by the **love of truth** and its preparation for use. They carry the "seed" to its destination.  
* **Prostate:** Corresponds to **spiritual support and affection**. Just as the prostate adds fluid to seed, spirits here provide the celestial affection that "lubricates" and vitalizes truths for fruitful implantation.

### **B. Female Organs: Inmost Good**

* **Womb (Uterus):** Corresponds to the **inmost good of innocence** and the **nurturing of truth**. The "province of the womb" in the Grand Man is inhabited by celestial angels who exist in a state of highest bliss and protect the "germs" of new spiritual life. It represents the protection of the Lord's own presence in the soul.

## ---

**VIII. The Appendicular Skeleton and Extremities: Power and Ultimates**

The limbs represent the power and execution of the Grand Man's will.

### **A. The Upper Extremities: Power of Truth**

* **Shoulders:** Correspond to **power** and support. They bear the burden of the Grand Man's action.  
* **Arms:** Represent the extension of power.  
* **Hands:** Correspond to the **ultimate expression of power** to affect change. To "have in hand" spiritually means to possess the power of truth.

### **B. The Lower Extremities: Natural Good**

The legs correspond to **Natural Good** and the support of the higher heavens.1

* **Loins:** Correspond to conjugial love in its external aspect.  
* **Buttocks:** Correspond to **natural loves** at the foundation of life.  
* **Thighs:** Correspond to the **good of celestial and spiritual love** (love of neighbor/God) acting as a stabilizer for the body.  
* **Knees:** Symbolize the **conjunction** of the natural with the spiritual; associated with humiliation and submission to Divine order.  
* **Legs:** Correspond to **natural good**.1  
* **Heels:** Correspond to the **lowest natural**, closest to the world. Often associated with the literal sense of the Word which can be "bruised" by falsity.  
* **Feet/Soles:** Correspond to the **natural and sensual degrees**. The soles serve as the ultimate foundation for the heavens. Those in the soles live in natural delight but serve the higher heavens.  
* **Nails:** Correspond to the **sensual and literal-mindedness** ("ultimate of ultimates"). Spirits here are obstinate, clinging to the surface, often "hard" or lacerating like a nail. They are necessary for protection but can be damaging if not trimmed.

## ---

**IX. The Structural and Covering Systems**

### **A. The Skeletal System**

* **Bones:** Correspond to spirits with **little spiritual life** (rigid intellectual characters) who serve as the support structure for the Grand Man. They have little joy but provide necessary stability.1  
* **Spine and Vertebrae:** Correspond to the **intellectual support** of the Grand Man.  
  * **Thoracic Vertebrae:** Correspond to the **affection of truth**.  
  * **Lumbar Vertebrae:** Correspond to the separation of the useful from the non-useful.  
  * **Sacrum/Coccyx:** Correspond to the **lowest natural goods**.

### **B. The Joint Components**

* **Cartilage:** Corresponds to a state of **transition** or yielding truth.  
* **Synovia:** The lubricating fluid corresponds to a "grosser" spiritual fluid that facilitates the movement of the Grand Man's members, representing the **medium of vital essence** in external acts.  
* **Ligaments and Tendons:** Correspond to the **social bonds** and the concentration of force that hold spiritual societies together.

### **C. The Integumentary System (Skin)**

* **Skin (Cuticle/Epidermis):** Corresponds to **external spiritual truths** and the literal sense of the Word. It acts as the protective boundary of the Grand Man, holding all interior things together.  
  * **Epidermis:** Corresponds to the most superficial, sensory level of thought.  
  * **Cuticle:** Corresponds to those who live primarily according to appearances but are kept within the Grand Man.

### **D. Bodily Fluids**

* **Perspiration and Sweat:** Correspond to the **excretion of spiritual falsities** or things "not of use." Sweat represents the "toil" of temptation and the casting out of external evils.  
* **Phlegm and Mucus:** Correspond to **lower or external truths** that have become "thickened" or obscured by worldly concerns.

## **X. Conclusion: The Living Image**

The anatomy of the Divine Human provides a comprehensive map of spiritual reality. From the celestial heights of the cerebrum to the sensual extremities of the nails, every part of the human form corresponds to a specific function in the universal heaven. This Divine Anatomy reveals that heaven is not a collection of disembodied souls, but a unified, organic entity—a Grand Man—living and acting from the influx of the Lord, who is the Soul of this Divine Body. Understanding this anatomy allows one to perceive the spiritual causes behind physical existence and the orderly arrangement of angelic societies in their eternal service of Use.
