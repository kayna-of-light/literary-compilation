# **The Spiritual Numerology of the Word: An Analysis of Swedenborg's Foundational System**

In the theological framework of Emanuel Swedenborg, the numbers found within the Word are not arbitrary figures but precise expressions of spiritual realities. They form a coherent, symbolic language that reflects the very structure of divine order, conveying the qualities and states of heavenly love, wisdom, and life. This system is not merely a symbolic code but a form of divine anatomy, where the relationships between numbers mirror the sacred relationships between spiritual principles.

This report seeks to distill the core principles of this spiritual numerology, providing a structured analysis of its foundational system. Drawing from Swedenborg's exegetical works, primarily *Apocalypse Explained* and *Secrets of Heaven*, our examination will focus on the four simple numbers from which the entire system is derived—two, three, five, and seven. We will then explore the principles by which their profound significations are extended to all other numbers and how their meanings adapt within the rich contextual tapestry of the Word.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **1.0 The Four Foundational Numbers and Their Core Significations**

The entire system of spiritual numerology finds its root in four simple, yet profoundly significant, numbers: two, three, five, and seven. All other numbers mentioned in the Word, regardless of their complexity, derive their spiritual meaning from the qualities inherent in these foundational figures. Understanding their primary significations is therefore the first and most critical step in deciphering the divine language of numbers. Each corresponds to a universal aspect of spiritual life, forming the building blocks for a comprehensive symbolic structure.

### **1.1 The Number Two: Union and Goodness**

The number **two** fundamentally signifies **union** and is predicated of **good**. This signification is rooted in the essential dualities that structure both the heavens and the human mind. In heaven, there are two primary loves—love for the Lord and love for the neighbor—which together form a perfect union. Likewise, the human mind is composed of two primary faculties: the volition, which is the receptacle of good, and the intellect, which is the receptacle of truth.

This principle extends from the human scale to the divine, as illustrated by the very structure of heaven, which is divided into two primary kingdoms:

* **The Celestial Kingdom:** Comprised of angels receptive to divine **good**, corresponding to the human faculty of **volition**.  
* **The Spiritual Kingdom:** Comprised of angels receptive to divine **truth**, corresponding to the human faculty of **intellect**.

These two kingdoms, while distinct, are held in perfect union by the Lord, reflecting the inseparable nature of divine good and divine truth. Therefore, whenever the number two appears, it directs the mind to a state of conjunction, partnership, and the union that arises from goodness.

### **1.2 The Number Three: Fullness and Truth**

The number **three** signifies a state of **fullness** or **completeness** and is predicated of **truths**. Because it represents "all," it frequently describes a complete cycle, state, or period, from its beginning to its end. This concept of totality is essential to understanding its application throughout the Word. This signification of "three" as a complete and finished state is consistent throughout the writings (cf. *Apocalypse Explained 532*).

A potent example of this principle is found in the instruction to Moses at Mount Sinai: the people were to be consecrated for two days and be ready for the third day, "because on the third day, Jehovah will come down" (*Exodus 19:10-11, 16*). Here, the third day represents the completion of a state of spiritual preparation, making it the state of readiness for Divine influx and presence. The three heavens—central, intermediate, and outmost—similarly represent the complete structure of the angelic world. Thus, the number three is not merely a quantity but a symbol of a perfected state, indicating that all things related to the subject at hand have been brought to their conclusion.

### **1.3 The Number Five: Quantity and Sufficiency**

The number **five** signifies **much** and **something**, denoting a specific quantity or a significant portion. Unlike the absolute fullness of "three" or the sanctity of "seven," the number five is used to represent a sufficient or notable amount of a spiritual quality or possession.

Its role as a signifier of quantity is evident in the instruction to Joseph concerning the years of plenty:

And take one **fifth** from the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundant grain provisions. (*Secrets of Heaven 8, Genesis 41:34*)

Here, "one fifth" symbolizes a specific and sufficient portion of the harvest to be preserved. It represents "something" set aside that is essential for future use. Similarly, the servant who gained "five pounds" was given authority over "five cities," indicating a measure of spiritual responsibility corresponding to his gains (*Apocalypse Revealed*). In both cases, five points to a meaningful, but not necessarily total, quantity.

### **1.4 The Number Seven: Holiness and Sanctity**

The number **seven** carries the ultimate signification of **holiness** and **sanctity**. It is intrinsically linked to states of divine peace, sacred time, and conjunction with the Lord.

The preeminent example of its holy signification is the **Sabbath**, the seventh day. It was instituted as the "holiest symbol of the church" and was named for "quietness and peace," representing a state of perfect conjunction with the Lord (*Heaven and Hell*). This quality of divine peace and holiness extends to other uses of the number. The vision of the Son of Man in *Apocalypse Explained* is replete with this symbolism:

* **Seven golden lampstands** (the new church in the good of love)  
* **Seven stars** (all knowledges of good and truth)  
* **Seven fiery lamps** (God's seven spirits)

In each instance, the number seven imbues the object with a quality of divine sacredness, signifying its direct connection to the Lord and its perfection.

These foundational meanings are not confined to their simple forms but are extended through clear mathematical principles to encompass all numbers in the Word.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2.0 The Principle of Derivation: How Numbers Inherit Meaning**

The spiritual meanings of the foundational numbers are not isolated but are systematically extended to larger, composite numbers. This principle of derivation ensures that the entire numerological system remains coherent and interconnected. The primary method for this derivation is multiplication, by which composite numbers inherit the spiritual qualities of the simple numbers from which they are formed.

According to *Apocalypse Explained*, the rules of derivation are straightforward and consistently applied:

* **Multiplication:** Greater numbers derive their spiritual signification from the simple, foundational numbers (2, 3, 5, 7\) through the process of multiplication.  
* **Composition:** "Composite numbers have a like meaning with the simple numbers from which they are produced by multiplication" (*Apocalypse Explained 54*).  
* **Multiplication by Ten:** Multiplying a simple number by ten carries forward its core signification into a fuller state of that quality.

### **2.1 Analysis of Key Derived Numbers**

By applying these rules, the meaning of more complex numbers can be clearly understood.

* **Numbers Derived from Two (Union & Good):** Numbers that arise from the multiplication of two by itself, such as 4, 8, and 16, share its signification of union and goodness. The number **40**, for example, is especially significant. Its meaning of the duration of temptation, as seen in the "forty years in the wilderness" (*Secrets of Heaven 10*), is derived from its root in the number two, with its multiplication signifying a full period of testing.  
* **Numbers Derived from Three (Fullness & Truth):** Numbers such as 6 (2x3) and 12 (3x4) derive their meanings from the fullness of truth signified by three. The number **12** is particularly significant, representing *all things of truth derived from good*. Its meaning is composed from its factors: "three," signifying all truths, and "four" (2x2), signifying union and good. This combination makes profound theological sense, thus signifying the perfect state of the church, where a *fullness of truth* (3) is inseparably *united with goodness* (4). This is why the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles represent the entirety of the church in its fullness.  
* **Numbers Derived from Five (Quantity):** Larger numbers like 10, 100, and 1,000 inherit the meaning of "much" or "something" from their root in five. The number **10** (2x5), for instance, signifies "remains." These are not mere traces but "all the states in which goodness and truth affect us...which the Lord stores up in us for use in our life after death" (*Secrets of Heaven 3, §1906*). Remains are thus a divinely preserved portion, or "something," of spiritual life essential for our salvation.  
* **Numbers Derived from Seven (Holiness):** Derived numbers such as 14 (2x7) and 70 (7x10) carry forward the signification of holiness. The "fourteenth day of the month," mentioned for holy observances, combines the union of "two" with the sanctity of "seven," denoting a state of holy conjunction.

While these mathematical rules of derivation are primary, the final interpretation of a number's meaning is often refined by its specific application within the narrative of the Word.

### **2.2 Intensification by Triplication**

A second, crucial principle of derivation is triplication, a method used to signify that a spiritual state is to the full, representing absolute completeness from beginning to end. Whereas multiplication combines qualities, triplication intensifies a single quality to its ultimate degree.  
The number 666 serves as the primary example of this principle. The tripling of the number six in its composition (600, 60, and 6\) signifies that the state of falsity and evil it represents is total and complete, to the point where "nothing whatever of truth and good remains." This principle is critical for understanding numbers that represent the ultimate expression of a spiritual quality, whether positive or negative.

The number 666, cited in Revelation 13:18, represents a state of complete spiritual inversion. Its meaning is derived through a systematic application of the principles of multiplication and triplication in their negative sense.

1. The Root Number (Six): The number is derived from the simple number six.  
2. Composition of Six (2 x 3): Six arises from its factors two (predicated of good/evil) and three (predicated of truth/falsity).  
3. Negative Signification of Six: In its opposite sense, six therefore symbolizes all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex. It is the union of evil (2) with falsity (3).  
4. Intensification by Triplication: The number is then tripled (expressed as 600, 60, and 6). This operation intensifies the meaning to its fullest possible degree, signifying a complete and total state of profanation where all truth has been falsified and nothing of good remains.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3.0 Contextual Nuance and the Principle of Opposites**

The spiritual meaning of a number, while rooted in a core concept, is not rigidly fixed. The context in which a number appears is critical for its precise interpretation, serving to modify or specify its meaning. Furthermore, the spiritual world operates on a principle of opposites, where every good and truth has a corresponding evil and falsity. This principle extends to numerology, allowing a number to signify the complete inversion of its genuine meaning.

### **3.1 The Evolution of Meaning in Context**

A number's abstract spiritual meaning takes on a more concrete form based on its narrative or doctrinal application.

* **From Abstract to State:** The number **three**, which abstractly signifies the "fullness of truth," becomes a symbol for a *complete state or period* when used in a temporal context. As noted in *Heaven and Hell*, "Expressions of time in the Word mean states" (§165). Thus, "three days" signifies not a literal duration but the completion of a spiritual process or state, from its beginning to its end.  
* **From General to Specific:** The number **twelve**, which generally signifies "all things of truth from good," is applied specifically to represent the entirety of the church. This can be seen in its association with the **twelve tribes of Israel** and the **twelve apostles**, both of which represent the church in its universal aspect, encompassing all its constituent truths and goods.

### **3.2 The Doctrine of Opposites**

Nearly every symbol in the Word possesses an opposite sense, representing the perversion of the original spiritual quality. Just as "kings" can signify those in truths from good, in the opposite sense they signify "those in falsities from evil" (*Apocalypse Explained 40*). This same principle applies directly to numbers.

If a number signifies a particular good or truth, its use in a negative context signifies the profanation or destruction of that quality. The number **666**, the number of the beast in *Apocalypse Revealed*, is a powerful example of this inversion. It signifies a state where "all the truth of the Word is falsified," representing a complete and systematic profanation of divine order and a total inversion of truth into falsity.

While the system of numerology is robust for derived numbers, certain other numbers mentioned in the Word present an analytical challenge, requiring different interpretive methods.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4.0 Analytical Challenges: Other Mathematical Operations and Un-derived Primes**

While the system of deriving meaning through multiplication is clearly defined, the source texts are less explicit about the roles of addition and subtraction, or the meaning of prime numbers outside the foundational four. This section explores these complex areas based on the available textual evidence.

### **4.1 The Role of Addition and Subtraction**

A thorough analysis of the source texts reveals that the principle of derivation through **multiplication** is overwhelmingly prioritized. *Apocalypse Explained* states that "composite numbers have a like meaning with the simple numbers from which they are produced by multiplication" (§54). This rule of composition through multiplication is the primary mechanism described.

Therefore, while interpreters may observe patterns related to addition or subtraction, these operations lack the explicit doctrinal foundation of multiplication and must be regarded as speculative rather than systematic principles of derivation.

### **4.2 Interpreting Other Prime Numbers**

The Word occasionally employs prime numbers that are not part of the foundational set (2, 3, 5, 7). Since these numbers cannot be derived by multiplication from the foundational four, their spiritual meaning must be understood primarily from the direct context in which they appear, rather than from a systemic rule.

An analysis of the number seventeen provides a clear example. In *Secrets of Heaven*, it is stated:

Jacob lived in the land of Egypt **seventeen years**. And Israel’s days for dying came near. (*Secrets of Heaven 9, Genesis 47:28-29*)

Here, the number **seventeen** is directly associated with the end of Jacob's life and his transition into the next—a state immediately preceding spiritual rebirth and resurrection. Therefore, in this specific context, seventeen signifies a state of transition and the culmination of a life stage just before entering a new spiritual existence. Other such numbers, like the "thirty-three souls" of Leah's lineage (*Secrets of Heaven 9*), must be interpreted similarly, by examining the spiritual state or quality being described in the immediate passage.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5.0 Synthesis and Conclusion: The Coherent Language of Spiritual States**

This analysis has demonstrated that numbers within the Word, as interpreted by Emanuel Swedenborg, form a coherent and deeply meaningful symbolic system. The central thesis is that this entire numerological framework originates from four foundational numbers, each with a distinct and universal signification: **two** for union and good, **three** for fullness and truth, **five** for quantity and sufficiency, and **seven** for holiness and sanctity.

The meanings of these core numbers are systematically extended to all other composite numbers through the principle of derivation by multiplication. However, this system is not merely mechanical; the final meaning of a number is always nuanced by its specific context and can even be inverted to signify its direct opposite. This framework provides a profound tool for understanding the deeper, spiritual sense of the Word, revealing a divine architecture where nothing is superfluous. It is a divine language that expresses the very qualities, states, and progressions of spiritual life as love and wisdom are ordered and made manifest by the Lord.
