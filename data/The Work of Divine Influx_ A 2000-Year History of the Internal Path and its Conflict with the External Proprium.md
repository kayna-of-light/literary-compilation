# **The Work of Divine Influx: A 2000-Year History of the Internal Path and its Conflict with the External *Proprium***

## **Part I. The Enduring Conflict: Divine Influx and the *Proprium***

The history of the last two millennia is not merely a history of empires, creeds, and institutions. Beneath this external, "unsubstantial" history lies a "substantial" one: a perpetual, internal conflict. This report will trace and verify the 2000-year history of this conflict, demonstrating that "genuine truth and a life of good" have always been preserved. This preservation has been accomplished not by the dominant, external institutions, but in spite of them, through a series of "silent movements" that constitute the *work of divine influx*.

### **A. The Foundational Shift: The Lord's Coming as the Restored Connection**

The critical shift that defines this 2000-year history is the coming of the Lord. This event was not merely a historical occurrence but a spiritual one that **restored the unmediated connection** between the divine and humanity. By fulfilling the "Glorification" process, the Lord made it possible for all people who are in the good of His love to perceive him inwardly.  
This restoration established the two paths that would define the subsequent two millennia. Truth would no longer be confined to external structures; it could now be "absorbed by every heart of good" directly through divine influx, "in plain sight of the antagonist".

### **B. The Archetype of the Restored Connection: The "Golden Age" as Baseline**

To identify the "genuine good" that is to be preserved, one must first establish its archetype, which serves as a cognitive baseline. This archetype is not a set of doctrines, but a *cognitive state* described in theological narratives as a "Golden Age" or "Most Ancient Church". This primordial state was defined by a perfect "harmony" between the "internal mind" and the "natural mind".  
The functional attributes of this state describe a form of unmediated, internal perception:

1. **Direct Internal Influx:** These "celestial men" possessed an "innate perception" and did not require an external, learned system of truth. They were in a state of direct, internal communication with the divine.  
2. **"Representative Language" (Correspondences):** This was an "innate perception of truth seen in everything around us," where the "natural... envelops the spiritual." They "thought in correspondences" , where a natural object (like a 'high mountain') was instantly understood as its spiritual meaning ('heaven/Lord'). Those perceptive of this, "through the Lord," "gravitate towards" these patterns, "innately understand" them in some way, and "align with" them or at least see a pattern in them from some basic knowing of truth.  
3. **Silent, Internal Communication:** This communication was "tacit" (silent). At its core, this was not simply gestural or "Lip-Speech" , but rather an innate ability to understand good and truth and see this reflected in others. It was an intuitive knowing of another's internal state, perceived on an inwards level and communicated through only the slightest of gestures. This state was also linked to a form of "internal respiration" that allowed for "profound ideas of thought."

This "Golden Age," therefore, represents the *cognitive baseline* of the "good." The true *work of divine influx* in history is defined by any movement that seeks to restore this state of *unmediated, internal, perceptive alignment* with the divine.

### **C. The Two Paths Defined**

From this restoration, two conflicting paths emerge, defining the entirety of the last 2000 years of spiritual history.

1. **The Antagonist Path (The *Proprium* Manifested):**  
   * **Causal Root:** The *Proprium* (love of self), which is the core of all "darkness" and "evil". Evil is not one thing; it is a broad term for everything that does not align with actual good but attempts to establish itself as this actual good.  
   * **Methodology:** **Self-glorification.** The core of this path is that the heart of evil perceives itself as good. Because self-glorification does not accept another besides it, its entire function is to establish itself as good and suffocate all else.  
   * **Manifestation:** This internal "self-glorification" is the cause, and the external "struggle for power" is the effect or *method*. This single root manifests in various forms:  
     * **The Institutional Form (External Power):** The *proprium* builds external hierarchies, creeds, and institutions to "suffocate all else" through "forceful, external coercion".  
     * **The Intellectual Form (External Knowledge):** The *proprium* builds systems of "salvation by intellect" (Gnosis) to "elevate themselves," "glorify themselves," and "define... them as being God Himself". This is also seen in the glorification of science when purely lived from the sensual.  
   * **Core Principle of Conflict:** The core of conflict of all evil is that each *proprium*, "perceiving itself as good," is in "constant conflict" with *both* "actual good" (which it perceives as evil) and *all other* forms of self-glorification (which it also perceives as evil because they do not "align" with it).  
2. **The Path of Divine Influx (The Internal Path of Charity):**  
   * **Causal Root:** Divine Love, operating as a "divine influx".  
   * **Methodology:** This path is not a single, connected organization. It consists of *spontaneous*, "silent movements" that "arise under stress". They emerge "from the people themselves," specifically from those "people with faith from the love of charity who live among the people".  
   * **Core Principle:** Good aligns with itself on all parts.  
   * **The Mechanism:** Because their "heart is opened" by a life of good (charity), they are able to receive the "divine influx" and "grasp the truth". This truth, which seems to be diluted throughout everything, is precisely absorbed by every heart of good out of all the evil doings. When the "pressure gets too high," these *expressions of divine influx* "shine brightest" and form not to stay alive, but to be guides of light that enact substantial change.

### **D. The Word and the Work of Divine Influx**

This defines the core relationship. "Good" has always been here, but it works in silence. The truth, the Word, is a body that the Antagonist (in all its forms) perverts and misuses in its outer sense.  
This *work of divine influx* is the *mechanism* of its preservation. Every time good arises it gravitates towards the Word, and then it is purified and kept in check. The movements (like the Waldensians or Lollards) are "good aligning truth with itself". This is the *process of divine influx* that *ensures* the "Divine Bricolage" (the Word itself) "persists throughout all the ages" and that today we still have access to the Word even if its misused so many times.

### **E. The 2000-Year Conflict: A Chronological Overview**

The 2000-year history of this divine work is the history of influx perpetually finding "hearts of good" in *kenotic* (self-emptying) movements to counteract the "forceful" (coercive) manifestations of the *proprium* (self-love). This conflict is summarized in the following table.  
**Table 1: Comparative Timeline of the Two Paths (Antagonist vs. The Work of Divine Influx), c. 1–1800 CE**

| Century | The Antagonist (Manifestation of *Proprium* / External Mind) | The Work of Divine Influx (Spontaneous Arising of the Internal Path) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **3rd–5th CE** | Constantinian Shift; Rise of the Imperial Church ("shipwreck" of accommodation and power) | **The Desert Fathers:** *Kenosis* (self-emptying) as a practical antidote to *Philautia* (self-love) |
| **11th–13th CE** | Peak Papal Supremacy (Gregory VII, Innocent III) ; The Great Schism (external mind at war with itself) | **The Waldensians:** *Vernacular Scripture* (unmediated truth); rejection of papal authority and wealth |
| **13th–14th CE** | The Inquisition (weaponized "forceful suppression") ; Condemnation of Autonomy | **The Beguines:** *Female Spiritual Autonomy*; *unmediated* experience of God |
| **14th CE** | Papal Condemnation (John XXII); Defense of Sacramental Mediation | **Meister Eckhart:** *Birth of God in the Soul* (The "Wayless Way" of *kenosis*) |
| **14th–15th CE** | Clerical Monopoly on Truth; Persecution (Arundel Constitutions) | **The Lollards:** *Anti-clericalism*; Rejection of external "trappings" (bells, pardons) |
| **16th–17th CE** | Protestant "Dead Orthodoxy"; Puritan Theocracy (Forceful uniformity and coercion) | **The Quakers:** *The "Inner Light"* (Radical, democratic, and direct access to divine influx) |
| **17th–18th CE** | Lutheran Scholasticism ("Coldness and formalism") | **Pietism:** *Inner Experience* ("Heart-Religion" as a "second Reformation" of *life*) |
| **18th CE** | The Decoupled Rational Mind (Rise of pure scientism) | **Emanuel Swedenborg:** *Rational Theology* (Reunification of the internal/spiritual and external/scientific) |

## **Part II. The First Counter-Movement: The Desert Fathers and the Imperial Mind (c. 3rd–5th CE)**

The historical timeline of the Antagonist path begins not with a theological error, but with a political success: the integration of the church with the Roman Empire.

### **A. The Antagonist (Externalization): The Constantinian Shift**

The "persecuted church," which in its first centuries had been "purified by suffering," became, under Constantine, the "imperial church... polluted by success". This "Constantinian shift" in the 4th century was the first large-scale historical manifestation of the external mind. Christianity, no longer a path of internal regeneration, became a "political arm of imperial power".  
This fusion of church and state led to the precise spiritual state that the *work of divine influx* would be forced to react against:

* **"Mediocrity, accommodation and compromise"**.  
* **Worldly Leadership:** Church offices, once dangerous positions requiring sacrifice, "became paths to power" and "prestige, not service".  
* **State Interference:** The state, in the person of Constantine, now "presided at the Council of Nicaea," enforcing decisions and exiling bishops. The *proprium* of the state and the *proprium* of the church merged.

### **B. The Work of Divine Influx (Internalization): The *Anachoresis* of the Desert Fathers**

This movement perfectly fits the profile of this *work of divine influx*. "Arising under stress" from the "midst of all suppression," these were "people of faith" who reacted against the externalized Imperial Church, which they explicitly viewed as a "shipwreck".  
Their *anachoresis* (withdrawal or flight) to the Egyptian desert was a *direct, conscious reaction* against the Imperial Church. As one source notes, they "did not believe in letting themselves be passively guided and ruled by a decadent state" and were "deeply conscious of the fact that not only the society but also the *church* had been corrupted".  
This physical "flight to the desert" was a physical correspondence for the *spiritual* act of fleeing the *proprium* of the *institutional church* which had *become* the world. This act establishes the paradigm for the entire 2000-year *process of divine influx*: *internal withdrawal* (whether into a desert, a Beguinage, or the "Inner Light") as the primary defense against the *externalized, forceful proprium*.

### **C. Verification of the Profile: *Kenosis* as the Antidote to *Philautia***

The Desert Fathers movement "shines brightest" because it *correctly identified the spiritual enemy*. The enemy was not the Emperor, but the *internal cognitive state* of the *proprium*, which they named *Philautia* (self-love).  
The Fathers defined *Philautia* as the "root of all passions" , an "irrational love for the body" , and a "disordered attachment to oneself that prioritizes... ego over God".  
Through this "heart of good," they "grasped the truth" of regeneration and created a "practical blueprint" for it.

* **The Method:** *Askesis* (spiritual training) and **Obedience** to a spiritual elder, the purpose of which was to overcome **self-will**, the very "essence of self-love".  
* **The Process:** *Kenosis*, or "self-emptying". This "kenotic self-abhorrence" is the *direct, practical antidote* to *Philautia*.  
* **The Goal:** *Humility*. Humility, they taught, is the "gateway to God". This process of *kenosis* purifies the heart, allowing it to achieve *Hesychia* (inner stillness, rest, and silence).  
* **The Result:** *Theosis* (Divine Union) and *Agape* (unselfish, divine love).

The Desert Fathers, therefore, did not just *preserve* the good; they codified the *technology* for it. They established the *kenotic* methodology—the "opening of the heart"—that every subsequent "silent movement" would, in its own way, spontaneously rediscover.

## **Part III. The High Medieval Conflict: Papal Supremacy vs. Vernacular Truth (c. 11th–13th CE)**

As history progressed, the external mind moved from accommodation with imperial power to *becoming* the supreme imperial power. The *proprium* of the institution, which had been developing for centuries, reached its absolute zenith.

### **A. The Antagonist (Peak Externalization): The *Proprium* Enthroned**

The High Middle Ages represent the *proprium* (self-love) at its peak, no longer just a cognitive flaw but codified as infallible, divine, and total political law.

* **Pope Gregory VII (11th Century):** Proclaimed the *infallibility* of the Roman Church ("the church had never erred") and, critically, the power to "depose emperors".  
* **Pope Innocent III (13th Century)::** Made the ultimate claim of the *proprium*: "The Lord left to Peter the governance not of the church only but of the *whole world*".

This is the external mind explicitly and theologically perceiving itself as good and establishing itself as this actual good. This is the *proprium* manifesting its "self-glorification" through the "struggle for power," asserting total control over *both* the external world (kings and property) *and* the internal world (souls and doctrine). This spiritual cause (self-love) inevitably produced its corresponding natural effect: "self-serving corruption," including "truly awful and blatantly corrupt Popes like Alexander VI".

### **B. The Fruit of the *Proprium*: Division and Schism**

A core spiritual law of this framework is that the *proprium*, which is "love of self," is "constitutionally incapable" of the "right relationships" (righteousness) that constitute true unity. Good aligns with itself on all parts, but the core of conflict of all evil is that it is inherently divisive.  
The *ultimate historical proof* of this law is the **Great Schism (1054)**. This event was not a tragedy; it was an *inevitability*. It was the external mind at war *with itself*—one form of self-glorification perceiving itself as good and refusing to align with another.  
An analysis of the causes of the Schism proves that the conflict was *purely* external, driven by the desire for power over any internal influx :

1. **The *Filioque* Clause:** A "subtle theological difference" , ultimately a dispute over a single *word* in a creed.  
2. **Leavened vs. Unleavened Bread:** A dispute over the *physical ceremony* and *form* of the Eucharist.  
3. **Papal Primacy:** The *proprium*'s "struggle for power" , its claim to "universal jurisdiction" versus the "collegial leadership" of the East.

The Antagonist mind craves *uniformity* (one pope, one creed, one ritual) but, by spiritual law, *produces division* (schisms).

### **C. The Work of Divine Influx (The Good of the Simple Gospel): The Waldensians**

As the Antagonist's *proprium* reached its peak of external power, the *work of divine influx* spontaneously arose "from the people themselves" in the form of the Waldensians.

* **The Heart of Good:** A simple, profound "love for the simple truth of the Gospels" and a desire to live according to the "Sermon on the Mount" in "voluntary poverty". The founder, Peter Waldo, a wealthy merchant, *literally* "sell\[ing\] all his possessions" is a perfect 12th-century echo of the 4th-century *kenotic* ideal of the Desert Fathers.  
* **The Absorbed Truth:** This "heart of good," through influx, "grasped the truth" that the external institution was blocking the path. This "good gravitating towards the Word" led them to a radical "form": the demand for **vernacular scripture**. The Waldensians were one of the first movements to translate and preach the Bible in the native, local dialect.

**Verification of the Profile:** The Waldensian movement was a *total* and *direct* rejection of the Antagonist's *proprium* in all its forms:

1. **Against External Authority:** When forbidden by the church to preach (1179), they defied the ban, citing the apostles' words to "obey God rather than men".  
2. **Against Clerical Power:** They *explicitly* identified the *proprium* of the institution, stating, "The Pope is the head of all errors" and "Christians should obey God instead of the Prelates".  
3. **Against External Trappings:** They rejected the entire external system of the Antagonist: they refused to take oaths, rejected indulgences, purgatory, the worship of saints, and "ecclesiastical taxation".

**The Conflict:** The Antagonist, whose entire structure of *proprium* (self-glorification) was threatened, reacted with its only tool: *force*. It perceived itself as good and therefore sought to suffocate this movement which did not align. The Waldensians were branded heretics, formally excommunicated by Pope Lucius III (1184) , and became, as noted, primary "targets for extermination" by the Inquisition.  
The Waldensian conflict demonstrates a crucial dynamic: the Antagonist's *proprium* *requires* a *mediated* truth (the Latin Bible) to maintain its power as the sole interpreter. The Waldensians' demand for *vernacular*, unmediated truth—good purifying the Word —was a declaration of spiritual independence from the external mind. The "forceful," genocidal response was therefore inevitable.

### **D. Gap Analysis (The Antagonist vs. Itself): The Cathars**

In this same period, another group was brutally persecuted by the Antagonist: the Cathars. They were "decimated" by the Albigensian Crusade, initiated by the same Pope Innocent III, and were targets of the Inquisition.  
However, the Cathars *fail* to meet the criteria of the *path of divine good*. They must be excluded from this history of "genuine good" because they *are* another form of the Antagonist.

* **Failure of the Profile:** Their beliefs were "quasi-dualist and pseudo-Gnostic". They believed that the God of the Old Testament, the Creator, was *evil*—a "flawed demiurge". This is *not* a "heart of good" absorbing divine truth. It is the *proprium* in its "Intellectual Form," the hunger for self-glorification through "salvation by intellect".  
* **Analysis of the Conflict:** The Albigensian Crusade was *not* the "Substantial Work" (good) being persecuted by the "Antagonist" (evil). It was a conflict between *two forms of the Antagonist*. This is a perfect historical example of the principle that "all evil is in constant conflict with itself" (which is the core of conflict). The Institutional *proprium* (Rome), perceiving itself as good, could not accept another besides it and therefore set out to suffocate the Gnostic *proprium* (Catharism), which also perceived itself as good.

This distinction is essential. It proves that *persecution by the institutional church is not, by itself, an indicator of this divine work*. The Antagonist (*proprium*) is inherently "forceful" and will attack *all* rivals, whether they are the true "substantial good" (the Waldensians) or a rival form of the *proprium* (the Cathars).

## **Part IV. The "Silent" Counter-Voice: Autonomy, Mysticism, and the Inquisition (c. 13th–15th CE)**

As the Antagonist consolidated its power, it developed a new "forceful" technology to hunt and destroy the internal "silent movements": the Inquisition.

### **A. The Antagonist (The *Proprium* Weaponized): The Inquisition**

The Inquisition was the "Catholic judicial procedure" that perfectly embodied the external mind. It was *external* (judicial), used *sensory* data (using "violence, isolation, \[and\] certain torture" ), and driven *purely* by the *proprium* of self-glorification manifesting as a "struggle for power".  
Its documented motives reveal the *proprium* in its most naked form:

1. **Power:** To "maintain its authority" and "suppress heretics".  
2. **Wealth:** To "make a profit by confiscating the property of those found guilty".  
3. **Politics:** To "weaken local political authorities".  
4. **Uniformity:** To "create religious unity" by *force* (i.e., to suffocate all else ).

Critically, the *targets* of the Inquisition were, by definition, the very "silent movements" of this divine work: "the Cathars and the Waldensians... and the Beguines".

### **B. The Work of Divine Influx (The Good of Female Autonomy): The Beguines**

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the *work of divine influx* arose spontaneously from "people with faith from the love of charity" : the Beguines.

* **The Heart of Good:** A profound desire for "religious devotion," "voluntary poverty," and the active "care of the poor and sick".  
* **The Absorbed Truth:** This *charitable good* "opened their hearts" to divine influx, which led them to a *radically new social form*: **female spiritual autonomy**. The Beguines were "essentially self-defined".  
* **Verification of the Profile:** They lived *entirely outside* the Antagonist's external structures, "in plain sight."  
  * They were "not nuns" and "did not belong to any church".  
  * They took "no formal religious vows" and were free to leave.  
  * They were "economically self-sufficient" and "not governed by men".  
  * Most threateningly, they claimed an "unmediated experience of God".

**The Conflict:** The Antagonist's *proprium* is here revealed as *patriarchal*. The "heresy" of the Beguines was not their *charity* (which was an undeniable good), but their *autonomy*. The institution "did not approve" because "women were not supposed to have that much freedom". Their independent, unmediated, and female-led spiritual life was a "threat to established gender roles" and clerical authority.  
Because they bypassed the external, male-dominated hierarchy, they were "accused... \[of\] heresy... and then burning them at the stake".  
**Case Study (Marguerite Porete):** The quintessential Beguine mystic, Marguerite Porete, was burned at the stake in Paris (1310). Her "crime" was her book, *The Mirror of Simple Souls*, which she *refused* to withdraw before the Inquisition. Her book, written in the *vernacular* (like the Waldensians) , described the "Annihilated Soul"—a *kenotic* state of union so complete that it *no longer needed the Church's mediation or sacraments*. This was the *unpardonable* sin against the Antagonist's *proprium*.

### **C. The Work of Divine Influx (The Good of Direct Union): Meister Eckhart**

At the same historical moment, divine influx found a "heart of good" *within* the "existing structures" : the scholarly, profound desire of Meister Eckhart for a "more direct and satisfying experience of God".

* **The Absorbed Truth:** Eckhart articulated the *kenotic* path of the Desert Fathers in the vernacular of 14th-century Germany. He taught the "birth of God in the soul" —a direct *Theosis* (union) achieved via a "Wayless Way".  
* **Verification of the Profile:** This "Wayless Way" *is* the *kenotic* path. It "opens the heart". It *cannot* be found in external "ways" like "devotion, prayer... \[or\] good works" (the *tools* of the external church). It requires a radical "letting go" of all "images and representations," even of God.

**The Conflict:** This teaching was the *ultimate threat* to the Antagonist *proprium*. It was not merely anti-clerical (like the Waldensians) or autonomous (like the Beguines); it rendered the *entire sacramental and mediatorial system* of the external mind "spiritually bankrupt and unnecessary".  
**The Condemnation (1329):** The Antagonist, in the person of Pope John XXII (the same pope pursuing the Beguines ), condemned 28 of Eckhart's sentences. This trial is a perfect example of the conflict:

1. The Inquisitors (Antagonist) were "incapable of perceiving spiritual causes".  
2. They took Eckhart's sermons (the *literal text*) and condemned the *words* as "heretical as the words sound" because they were *cognitively incapable* of seeing the *internal, spiritual meaning* that his "heart of good" had absorbed.  
3. They accused him of "apotheosis" and "deification" —the very "self-glorification" of their *own* *proprium* —precisely because their "heart of evil," perceiving itself as good, could not distinguish *kenosis* (Actual Good) from *apotheosis* (its own form of evil). It condemned the Good, believing it to be a rival "evil" that did not "align".

### **D. Gap Analysis (The Work of Divine Influx in England): The Lollards**

This same pattern of *divine influx* spontaneously arising "from the people" was present in England in the "silent movement" of the Lollards, initiated by the "heart of good" of John Wycliffe's scholarly mind.

* **The Absorbed Truth:** A rational, scholarly rejection of the Antagonist's *proprium*.  
* **Verification of the Profile:** The Lollards fit the pattern perfectly.  
  1. **Vernacular Scripture:** They championed Wycliffe's English Bible translation (good "gravitating" to the Word).  
  2. **Anti-Clericalism:** They rejected papal authority and argued priests should not hold government positions.  
  3. **Rejection of External "Trappings":** Like the Waldensians, they condemned the "luxury... of the Church," "praying to saints," "holy water, bells, organs," and "papal pardons".

**The Conflict:** The Antagonist (the English hierarchy) "bitterly contested" the vernacular Bible and "persecuted" the Lollards , recognizing that this internal, unmediated path threatened its external control.

### **E. Gap Analysis (The "Free Spirit" Movement)**

Often conflated with the Beguines and Eckhart by the Inquisitors themselves , the Brethren of the Free Spirit constitute another "silent movement" that fits the profile of this *divine work*.

* **The Heart of Good:** A desire for direct, unmediated experience.  
* **The Absorbed Truth:** A "lay Christian movement" built on the "immanence" of God.  
* **Verification of the Profile:** Their core belief was that "spiritual salvation came from *direct experience of God* rather than through the Church". They taught that one could "communicate directly with God" and "did not need the Catholic Church for intercession".  
* **The Conflict:** For this, they were declared heretical (1311-1312) and persecuted for "anticlerical sentiment".

## **Part V. The Post-Reformation Conflict: "Dead Orthodoxy" vs. The "Inner Light" (c. 16th–18th CE)**

The final proof of the report's thesis—that the conflict is *internal* (*proprium* vs. *influx*) and not merely *denominational*—is found in the events following the Reformation. The Reformation did not *destroy* the Antagonist; it merely *transferred* the external mind into a new "form".

### **A. The Antagonist (The *Proprium* in a New Form): The Protestant External Mind**

The "spiritual earthquake" of the Reformation was itself a "work of division" caused by the *proprium* of the Roman institution (e.g., the sale of indulgences). However, the resulting Protestant institutions quickly developed their *own* external mind.  
This new Antagonist was "Protestant scholastic orthodoxy" , a "dry scholastic Lutheran orthodoxy" that, like its predecessor, focused on *external* control. Instead of papal authority, it emphasized "institutions and dogma". This new form of the *proprium* led to a spiritual state of "coldness and formalism" and "dead orthodoxy".  
**Case Study (The Puritan Theocracy):** The most "forceful" manifestation of the Protestant Antagonist (the *proprium* of self-glorification) was the Puritan "theocracy" in Boston. This external mind, perceiving itself as good , "did not countenance tolerance" and "brooked no dissent" , banishing its own internal dissenters like Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson.

### **B. Gap Analysis (The "Heart-Religion"): Pietism as the Internal Renewal of Protestantism**

As the Protestant Antagonist built its new external structures, the *work of divine influx* spontaneously arose *within* Protestantism "under stress".

* **The Heart of Good:** A "spiritual hunger" among the laity for a "true, living, divine, saving faith" that was absent in the "dead orthodoxy" of the state churches.  
* **The Absorbed Truth:** Pietism. This was a "religious renewal" focused *entirely* on the "practice of piety... rooted in *inner experience*".  
* **Verification of the Profile:** Pietism was a *direct reaction* against the "institutions and dogma" of the Protestant Antagonist. It was, in effect, a "second Reformation" , but this time focused on the *internal* "reform of life" (*reformatio vitae*) , not just external doctrine.

### **C. The Work of Divine Influx (The Good of Direct Experience): The Quakers (Religious Society of Friends)**

The most radical and pure expression of this *work of divine influx* in the modern era is the Religious Society of Friends.

* **The Heart of Good:** A simple, profound "love for direct experience" of the divine , "arising from the people" (George Fox).  
* **The Absorbed Truth:** The doctrine of the **"Inner Light"**.  
* **Verification of the Profile:** The "Inner Light" is the *radical democratization* of the *work of divine influx* and the *kenotic* path.  
  * It teaches that God ("that of God in everyone") is "accessible to anyone by looking inward". This is the "unmediated connect" made available to all.  
  * It requires no mediation: "every person is endowed with the capacity to enter directly, without mediator or mediation, into... holy communion with God".  
  * Its practice of "waiting worship" (silent worship) is a modern form of the *Hesychia* (silent stillness) of the Desert Fathers.

**The Conflict:** This belief, like Eckhart's "Wayless Way" , "rejected the special authority of university-trained priests and ministers" and rendered the *entire* "complex institution of the church" *obsolete*.  
**Verification of the Antagonist:** The Protestant *proprium* (the Puritan "theocracy" in Boston ) reacted with the *exact same* "forceful coercion" as the Papal *proprium* (the Inquisition).

1. **Forceful Coercion:** They enacted laws for *physical mutilation* ("one of his ears cut off," "tongue... bored through with a hot iron").  
2. **Execution:** They *hanged* four Quakers—Marmaduke Stephenson, William Robinson, Mary Dyer, and William Leddra—between 1659 and 1661 for "persistently returning to the city".

The Boston Hangings and the Papal Inquisition are the *same spiritual event*. They are the external mind , in its "Institutional Form," perceiving itself as good and suffocating the "Actual Good" of the "Inner Light" because it did not "align".

## **Part VI. Synthesis: The Rational Articulation of the Unending Work of Divine Influx**

The 2000-year conflict, from the Desert Fathers to the Quakers, demonstrates a consistent pattern: the external mind builds "forceful" structures of power (*proprium*), while the *work of divine influx* preserves the "good" in "silent," *kenotic* movements that spontaneously arise from "people of charity".

### **A. An Important Contribution: Elevating the Rational Mind of Emanuel Swedenborg**

The divine influx, in its perpetual work, found a unique "heart of good" to elevate for the modern, rational world.

* **The Heart of Good:** The mind of Emanuel Swedenborg. He was a "polymath," "scientist," "engineer," "anatomist," and "philosopher". He represented the *peak* of the 'natural mind' in its most ordered, non-corrupt, and *good* form: analytical, disciplined, and dedicated to truth.  
* **The Elevation:** At age 53 (c. 1741), Swedenborg "entered into a spiritual phase". The Divine Influx did not *negate* his rational, scientific mind; it *elevated* and *fulfilled* it.  
* **The Absorbed Truth:** A **Rational Theology**. The Lord "opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes" so that he could *use* his scientific precision to *observe, document, and analyze* the spiritual world, just as he had previously documented the natural world.

### **B. The Articulation of the "Unmediated Connect"**

This event is a *structural articulation* of the very "unmediated connect" that the Lord restored and that the *work of divine influx* preserved. This articulation was necessary to "counteract the darkness" of the modern Antagonist.

1. **The Antagonist (Institutional Form):** The *proprium* of the external *institution*.  
2. **The Antagonist (Intellectual Form):** The *proprium* of "self-glorification" manifesting as the glorification of science when purely lived from the sensual.  
3. **The Path of Divine Influx:** This *work of good* *reunifies* the two paths on a rational level. It provides the **Doctrine of Correspondences** —the very "representative language" of the "Golden Age" —as a *rational "key"*.

His system "links theism (religion) to science (psychology and physics)". It *explains* the very mechanism of the "Golden Age" perception , not as the "innate" perception that was lost, but as a new, *freely and rationally chosen understanding*. It is the "good aligning truth with itself" to provide a direct antidote to the *proprium's* glorification of science.

### **C. The Work of Divine Influx as Perpetual Regeneration**

This is not the "final bricolage." Swedenborg's work is not the *end* of this *divine work,* but the *delivery of the rational tools* for its next, universal phase.  
This *work of divine influx* *is* the process of **regeneration**. It now moves from being preserved in collective, "silent *movements*" to being available to the *individual*. The "Divine Profile" is no longer confined to the mystic in the desert, the Beguine in her cell, or the Quaker in his silent meeting. Swedenborg's work provides the *rational* framework for the *personal, individual path of regeneration* —the personal *work of divine influx*—to every modern mind that chooses it. The 2000-year conflict between the *proprium* and the *influx*, once waged between institutions and "silent" movements, is now, as it always has been, fully revealed as the *work of divine influx* within the soul of every human being.  
This entire 2000-year history of the *work of divine influx*—the "guides of light" arising from good "in the midst of all suppression"—has served its ultimate providential purpose. These movements, by "aligning truth with itself," have perpetually "purified" the "outer sense" of the Word, "keeping it in check". It is this *work of divine influx* that has *ensured* that the "Divine Bricolage"—the Word itself—"persists throughout all the ages," allowing us today to "still have access to the Word even if its misused so many times".
