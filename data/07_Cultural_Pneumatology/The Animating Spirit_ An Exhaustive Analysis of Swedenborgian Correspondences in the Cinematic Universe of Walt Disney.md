# **The Animating Spirit: An Exhaustive Analysis of Swedenborgian Correspondences in the Cinematic Universe of Walt Disney**

## **I. Introduction: The Cartography of the Invisible**

The visual language of animation operates upon a fundamental, almost metaphysical premise: that the internal world of emotion, intent, and character can be—and indeed must be—externalized into the visible world of form, movement, and environment. In the medium of the animated feature film, a storm is rarely a mere meteorological event; it is the externalized fury of a protagonist or the chaotic upheaval of a social order. A landscape is not simply a geographical setting; it is the moral state of the kingdom made manifest in soil and flora. Animals are not distinct biological entities operating solely on Darwinian instinct; they are anthropomorphized extensions of human affection, acting as mirrors to the soul of the hero or the villain. This instinctive "language of nature," utilized intuitively by animators to communicate meaning to a universal audience, bears a striking, structural isomorphism to the theological and epistemological system proposed two centuries earlier by the Swedish scientist, philosopher, and mystic, Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772).  
This report undertakes a rigorous, comparative investigation into the narrative and visual structures of Disney animated feature films to determine the extent to which they align with Swedenborg’s "Doctrine of Correspondences." This doctrine posits that the natural world exists as a "theatre representative" of the spiritual world, where every physical object, animal, and phenomenon is an "ultimate effect" caused by a specific spiritual reality. The inquiry seeks not only to identify these parallels but to trace their complex genealogy. Is the resemblance between Disney’s "Pridelands" in *The Lion King* and Swedenborg’s description of the "State of the Church" coincidental, or does it stem from a shared lineage of influence flowing through the Romantic fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen, the psychological archetypes of Carl Jung, and the artistic sensibilities of the 19th-century Symbolists?  
The analysis proceeds from the hypothesis that Disney animation, through its reliance on literary devices such as the "Pathetic Fallacy" and mythic structures like the "Fisher King" archetype, inadvertently but precisely reconstructs a Swedenborgian cosmos. In this cosmos, the "King" corresponds to Divine Truth , the "Land" corresponds to the collective spiritual state of the people or the church , and "Animals" correspond to the specific volitional affections—the loves, lusts, and intellectual appetites—of the human spirit. By examining a corpus of films including *The Lion King*, *Beauty and the Beast*, *The Little Mermaid*, *Frozen*, *Tangled*, *Pocahontas*, *Aladdin*, *Sleeping Beauty*, *Brave*, and *Mulan*, this report will demonstrate that the "Disney Formula" is, functionally and semiotically, a "Science of Correspondences" applied to the medium of moving pictures.

### **1.1 The Epistemological Framework: Swedenborg’s Semiotics**

To assess the validity of the comparison between Disney’s cinematic language and Swedenborg’s theology, one must first define the precise mechanism of Swedenborgian correspondence. Unlike simple allegory, which Swedenborg dismisses as arbitrary invention or poetic simile, correspondence is defined as a causal, ontological relationship. It is not that a lion *reminds* the viewer of courage in a metaphorical sense; it is that the spiritual affection of the "power of truth" *causes* the form of a lion to exist in the natural world. The natural form is the "ultimate" container for the spiritual cause.  
Swedenborg’s system rests on three pillars that are particularly relevant to animation analysis:

* **Vertical Causality (Influx):** The spiritual world is the realm of causes; the natural world is the realm of effects. Life flows from the Divine, through the spiritual degrees, into natural forms. The quality of the form determines the reception of the influx. A distorted form (a villain or a wasteland) receives the same life force but twists it into evil or decay.  
* **Discrete Degrees:** Reality is stratified into distinct levels that do not merge but communicate via correspondence. The "Celestial" degree (pertaining to Love and the Will) flows into the "Spiritual" degree (pertaining to Wisdom and the Intellect), which in turn flows into the "Natural" degree (pertaining to Action and Form).  
* **The Grand Man (Maximus Homo):** Swedenborg posits that the entire heaven is structured in the form of a single human being, and by extension, human society and the church function as a "collective man." The health of this collective body depends on the proper subordination of the "natural" (feet/extremities) to the "spiritual" and "celestial" (heart/head).

In the context of animation, the animator plays the role of the "spiritual cause," infusing *anima* (life/soul) into the "natural" forms on screen. Thus, the physics of the Disney universe are inherently spiritual physics: gravity, light, color, and biology obey the emotional and moral logic of the scene rather than the laws of Newtonian mechanics. This artistic necessity aligns the medium perfectly with Swedenborg’s vision of a plastic, responsive spiritual world where "affections... manifest visibly as animals" and landscapes shift instantaneously to reflect the interior state of the inhabitants.

## **II. The King and the Land: Topography as Moral Mirror**

One of the most persistent and structurally significant tropes in the Disney canon is the intrinsic, causal link between the moral condition of the monarch and the physical health of the environment. This narrative device, known in comparative mythology and literary criticism as the "Fisher King" archetype , is structurally identical to Swedenborg’s correspondence of the "Land" or "Earth" with the "State of the Church" (the collective spiritual state of humanity). In Swedenborg’s exegesis, the physical state of the land in biblical prophecy—whether it is blooming, drought-stricken, or frozen—is never a description of agriculture but a precise diagnosis of the spiritual state of the people.

### **2.1 The Pridelands: A Case Study in Spiritual Vastation**

*The Lion King* (1994) offers the most explicit and detailed demonstration of Swedenborgian environmental correspondence in the Disney library. Under the rule of Mufasa, the Pridelands are lush, vibrant, and orderly. The "Circle of Life" represents a spiritual order where the "Sun" (corresponding to Divine Love and Wisdom ) governs the hierarchy of creation. Mufasa, whose name and role correspond to the "King" (Divine Truth governing via Law ), maintains the influx of life through adherence to Divine Order. He respects the boundaries of the kingdom and the balance of nature.  
When Scar usurps the throne, the transformation of the landscape is immediate, total, and unexplained by meteorological science. The sun is obscured by permanent dark clouds; the water (Truth ) dries up completely; the vegetation dies; and the land becomes a skeletal wasteland characterized by bones and gray earth.

* **Swedenborgian Analysis of Scar’s Reign**: This ecological collapse is a perfect depiction of what Swedenborg terms "Vastation." Swedenborg describes the "Earth" as the external church. When the "King" (Truth) is replaced by the "Usurper" (Falsity derived from Self-Love/Proprium), the connection to the "Spiritual Sun" is severed. The result is a "dry and thirsty land" where no water (truth) can be found. The hyenas, which invade the Pridelands, correspond to the "lusts of the natural mind" or "appetites without order". They are scavengers, representing the consumption of truth without the production of good.  
* **The Fisher King Connection**: Critics have explicitly linked Simba’s journey to the Fisher King legend, where the "wasteland" can only be healed by the return of the rightful King who asks the right question or restores the Grail. Swedenborgian theology provides the metaphysical mechanism for this healing: the "restoration of the church" (the return of Simba/Truth) re-establishes the influx of Divine Life. The physical world blooms instantaneously upon the restoration of moral order. The rain that falls upon Scar’s defeat and Simba’s ascension is the correspondence of "Truth" cleansing the earth of falsity and refreshing the "withered" state of the mind. The visual cue of the clouds clearing to reveal the sun matches the correspondence of the removal of falsity allowing the light of Wisdom to return.

### **2.2 Arendelle’s Eternal Winter: The Glacial State of Isolation**

In *Frozen* (2013), the landscape of Arendelle is frozen not by a climatic shift but by the internal emotional state of its Queen, Elsa. The film presents a literalization of the metaphor "frozen heart."

* **Swedenborgian Analysis of Cold**: Swedenborg writes extensively on the "frigid zones" of the spiritual world. He states that "in the spiritual world... climates vary according to the distances of the will's affections... from true love and true faith... In the frigid zones of the spiritual world things appear similar to those in the frigid zones of the natural world; lands and waters alike are bound in ice with snow upon them". These zones are inhabited by spirits who have "lulled their understanding to sleep" or isolated themselves from the warmth of Charity (Love). Elsa’s fear and isolation cut her off from "Love" (Heat ), resulting in a literal freezing of her environment.  
* **Snow vs. Ice**: In Swedenborg’s system, "Water" corresponds to Truth. "Ice" corresponds to truth that lacks good (love), becoming hard, brittle, and cold—often associated with "faith alone" without charity. "Snow" corresponds to natural truth that is cold but can be melted. Elsa’s power creates a beautiful but lifeless world of ice (intellectual structuring without warmth).  
* **The Thaw**: The film’s resolution hinges on the distinction between "Faith Alone" (fear/knowledge) and "Charity" (Love in action). Anna, who represents "Affection" or "Charity," must perform an act of true love to thaw the frozen heart. Swedenborg argues that only "spiritual heat" (Love) can melt the hardened state of the proprium. The thawing of the fjord at the end of the film is the restoration of the "flow of truth" (liquid water) through the "warmth of love" (sun).

### **2.3 The Beast’s Castle: Architecture of the Soul**

The castle in *Beauty and the Beast* (1991) serves as an architectural extension of the Beast’s soul, a motif heavily influenced by the Gothic tradition but readable through Swedenborg’s lens of the "House" as the mind. As the Prince descends into animalistic despair and rage, the castle becomes dark, gothic, and decaying. The "West Wing," holding the Rose (the remnant of spiritual life), is the most decayed and forbidden area—the "inmost" of the mind where the ruling love is sequestered.

* **Transformation as Glorification**: When the Beast is regenerated through his love for Belle (who represents the affection for truth or wisdom), the castle transforms. "Magical sparks spread across the castle... gargoyles transforming into angels and the darkened walls turning to alabaster".  
* **Swedenborgian Analysis**: This mirrors the "glorification" of the human form or the "regeneration" of the mind. The "stonework" and "gargoyles" represent the "hardened falsities" and "sensual lusts" of the unregenerate natural mind. The transformation into "alabaster" and "gold" corresponds to the reception of "celestial good" and "spiritual truth". The landscape shifts from a "dark forest" (a state of ignorance and temptation, inhabited by wolves/lusts) to a "garden" (a state of intelligence and wisdom). The transformation is not just cosmetic; it is ontological.

### **2.4 The Black Rot of Motunui: The Separation of Will and Understanding**

In *Moana* (2016), the "darkness" or "black rot" spreading across the islands is caused by the theft of the "Heart of Te Fiti."

* **Swedenborgian Analysis**: The "Heart" corresponds to the **Will** or **Divine Love**. Te Fiti, as the creative principle of nature, represents the "Celestial" degree of creation. When the "Heart" (Love) is separated from the body of the world, the result is "spiritual death" manifested as "decay" or "rot" in the vegetation. Maui, who stole the heart, represents the "Intellect" or "Human Proprium" acting independently of Divine Order, believing it can possess the source of life for itself (promethean theft). The "Demon of Earth and Fire," Te Ka, is revealed to be Te Fiti without her heart. This aligns with Swedenborg’s teaching that "Love" without "Wisdom" (or the heart separated from its order) turns into a consuming fire of self-love. The restoration of the Heart unites "Will" (Te Fiti) and "Understanding" (Moana/Maui), healing the land (The Church).

## **III. The Menagerie of the Mind: Animal Correspondences**

Swedenborg asserts that "animals correspond to affections; the tame and useful animals to good affections, and the fierce and useless ones to evil affections". In Disney films, animals rarely appear as mere livestock; they are almost always "sidekicks" or "extensions" of the main character, externalizing their inner emotional reality. This externalization is not random; specific animals consistently perform roles that align with their Swedenborgian correspondences.

### **3.1 The Horse: The Intellectual Principle**

In Swedenborg’s system, the **Horse** corresponds to the **Intellect** or the **Understanding of Truth**. The horse carries the rider just as the understanding carries the will. The quality of the horse (color, temperament) reflects the quality of the understanding.

* **Maximus (*Tangled*)**: Maximus is a white horse who is obsessed with the "Law." He hunts Flynn Rider (a thief) with the tenacity of a rigid intellect. He is "The Law" personified—intelligent, relentless, but initially lacking in charity. His "taming" by Rapunzel (who represents Affection/Good) illustrates the Swedenborgian principle that the "Intellect" must be guided by "Affection" to be useful. An intellect separated from love is hard and judgmental (Maximus at the start); conjoined with love, it becomes a powerful vehicle for good.  
* **Samson (*Sleeping Beauty*)**: Prince Phillip’s white horse symbolizes his "intellectual power" and "spiritual understanding." When Phillip fights the dragon (Maleficent), he rides the white horse (Truth) and wields the Sword of Truth (a specific Swedenborgian correspondence for "Truth combating Falsity"). Samson is brave but must be guided by Phillip, just as the understanding must be directed by the spiritual will.  
* **Philippe (*Beauty and the Beast*)**: A draft horse, earthy and easily frightened. He corresponds to the "natural understanding" which is easily spooked by the "dark forest" of ignorance and the "wolves" of lust/falsity. He carries Maurice (intellectual curiosity) but cannot protect him from the Beast (the unregenerate will) because the natural understanding is powerless against the will's ferocity without spiritual aid.  
* **Khan (*Mulan*)**: A black horse. In Swedenborg, "black" often signifies the "proprium" or the "natural will" which is not yet enlightened, but Khan is loyal and strong. His color contrasts with the white horse of Shang, representing the balance of "Yin" (female/natural) and "Yang" (male/spiritual) within the film's Taoist-adjacent visual language.  
* **Angus (*Brave*)**: A Shire horse, powerful and earthy. He corresponds to Merida’s "natural intellect"—strong, stubborn, and connected to the earth, supporting her desire for autonomy. He is the vehicle for her rebellion but also her strength.  
* **The Nokk (*Frozen II*)**: The water horse. Swedenborg specifically links the horse to "water" (truth) in the correspondence of Pegasus striking the fountain of Hippocrene to release knowledge. Elsa taming the Nokk is the perfect visualization of the "Spiritual Mind" (Elsa) subduing and riding the "Natural Understanding" (The Horse) through the dark waters of trial. She does not kill the horse; she reins it, creating a "bridle of understanding."

### **3.2 The Bird: Rational Thought and Intelligence**

**Birds** correspond to **rational concepts**, **thoughts**, and **intellectual ideas** because they fly above the earth (the natural mind) and have keen sight.

* **Scuttle (*The Little Mermaid*)**: Scuttle provides Ariel with "information" about the human world. However, his information is empirically wrong (calling a fork a "dinglehopper"). This mirrors Swedenborg’s description of "falsities" or "illusory truths" in the natural mind—reasoning from the senses that leads to error. He represents "false rationality" or "imagination".  
* **Zazu (*The Lion King*)**: A hornbill who serves as the majordomo. He represents "administrative truth" or "orderly thinking." He hovers over the kingdom, observing and reporting. He is the "Rational" attempting to keep the "Natural" (Simba) in check. His imprisonment by Scar (the ribcage) symbolizes the "Rational" being silenced or caged by the "Proprium" (Self-Love).  
* **Flit (*Pocahontas*)**: A hummingbird, representing quick, fleeting thoughts or anxieties. He is contrasted with Meeko (a raccoon), representing the "sensual" or "corporeal" appetites (food/curiosity). Flit acts as a "conscience" or "cautionary thought".  
* **Iago (*Aladdin*)**: A parrot. Parrots correspond to "imitative speech" or "repeating words without understanding." Iago mimics Jafar’s villainy but has no internal moral compass of his own (initially). He represents the "memory-knowledge" of the wicked mind, repeating falsities without genuine grounding.  
* **The Raven (Diablo) (*Sleeping Beauty*)**: Maleficent’s raven represents "secret falsities" or "spying thoughts" that seek out the innocent (Aurora) to destroy them. Birds of prey or carrion birds often signify "destructive thoughts" in Swedenborg.

### **3.3 The Dog: Natural Affection and Loyalty**

**Dogs** correspond to the **affections of the natural mind**, specifically **subservience**, **loyalty**, and **friendship**. In the negative sense, they can represent "unclean lusts," but Disney almost exclusively uses the positive correspondence of "faithful affection."

* **Bruno (*Cinderella*)**: Represents the loyal, natural affection that comforts Cinderella when her "spiritual" family (stepmother) rejects her. He dreams of chasing the cat (Lucifer/Evil), representing the natural mind's opposition to malice.  
* **Nana (*Peter Pan*)**: The nursemaid dog. Represents the "natural good" of caretaking and protection of innocence (the children).  
* **Max (*The Little Mermaid*)**: Recognizes the "good" in Ariel and the "evil" in Ursula (Vanessa) before the humans do. This aligns with Swedenborg’s view that "natural affections" (animals) often have a sharper instinctive perception of reality than the "perverted rational" (Prince Eric).  
* **Sultan (*Beauty and the Beast*)**: The footstool (dog). Even when transformed into an object, the "affection" remains—he acts like a dog. This illustrates the "permanence of the ruling love"; the form changes, but the affection remains.

### **3.4 The Cat and Feline: Sensual Knowledge and Power**

**Cats** often correspond to the **sensual man**, obsessed with self and comfort, or **deceit**. **Lions**, however, correspond to the **Power of Truth**.

* **Lucifer (*Cinderella*)**: The name itself (Light-bearer/Devil) hints at his role. He represents "sensual malice" and "deceit." He hunts the mice (innocent thoughts/affections). He is the "falsity" allied with the "evil" of the Stepmother. His laziness and gluttony map to the "lusts of the flesh".  
* **Rajah (*Aladdin*)**: A tiger. Tigers can represent "fierce defense" or "cruelty," but Rajah is Jasmine’s protector. He corresponds to the "power of the will" defending the "affection for truth" (Jasmine) from "falsity" (suitors/Jafar).  
* **Simba/Mufasa (*The Lion King*)**: The Lion is the "Power of Divine Truth." Mufasa’s roar is the "Voice of Truth." Scar, a lion with "green eyes" (often a symbol of envy/sickness), represents truth perverted into "tyranny".

### **3.5 Marine Life: The Scientifica**

**Fish** correspond to **scientifics** or **facts stored in the memory**. They live in the "water" (truth/knowledge) but are low on the evolutionary scale, representing the "natural mind" submerged in facts.

* **Flounder (*The Little Mermaid*)**: Represents the "simple knowledge" or "childlike affection for truth" that accompanies Ariel. He is not intellectual (like Scuttle) but emotional and supportive. He is "fact" animated by "affection."  
* **Ursula’s Eels (Flotsam and Jetsam)**: "Electric" eels. They represent "sensual knowledge" used to ensnare. Their "electric" nature mimics "spiritual light" but is actually a destructive force. They are the "spies" of the deep abyss (Hell), gathering information to manipulate the soul.

## **IV. The Royal Lineage: Truth, Good, and the Daughter of Zion**

The Disney Princess films almost invariably structure their royal families in a way that maps perfectly onto Swedenborg’s "conjugial" theology. In this system, the **King** represents **Divine Truth** (Intellect/Governance), the **Queen** represents **Divine Good** (Will/Protection), and the **Daughter** represents the **Spiritual Affection** (The Church or the Soul) that must undergo regeneration.

### **4.1 The Good King: The Benevolent Intellect**

Swedenborg states that a King represents Truth governing through Law. The "Good King" in Disney is often benevolent but sometimes rigid or naive, representing "Truth" that needs "Good" or "Affection" to be complete.

* **King Triton (*The Little Mermaid*)**: He wields the Trident (Power of Truth). His conflict with Ariel is the conflict between "Rigid Law" and "Free Spirit." He represents "Truth separating from Evil" (hating humans). He must learn to act from "Love" (giving her legs/freedom) rather than just "Law" (forbidding the surface). His evolution is the "Regeneration of the Truth" by Love.  
* **The Sultan (*Aladdin*)**: He represents "Good without Truth" or "Naivety." He plays with toys and is easily hypnotized (manipulated) by Jafar (Falsity). He lacks the "Sword of Truth" to defend his kingdom and needs Aladdin (Action/Practical Truth) to restore order. This mirrors Swedenborg’s warning that "Good without Truth is not genuine Good".  
* **Mufasa (*The Lion King*)**: The ideal union of "Love" and "Wisdom." He rules with "understanding" of the Circle of Life. He represents the "Internal Man" or the "Celestial" degree.  
* **King Fergus (*Brave*)**: Represents the "Natural" or "Corporeal" power—strong, loud, bear-hunter. He lacks the "spiritual insight" of the Queen but provides the "foundation" of strength.  
* **Chief Tui (*Moana*)**: Like Triton, he represents "Law" based on fear (don't go beyond the reef). He represents "Traditional Truth" that has become stagnant and must be revitalized by the "New Church" (Moana).  
* **The King (*Cinderella*)**: Obsessed with "Succession" (Grandchildren). He represents the "Old Church" seeking to perpetuate itself through a new generation (Prince/Cinderella). He is "Time" and "Tradition".

### **4.2 The Queen: The Internal Will**

The Queen often represents the "Internal" or "Will" aspect—sometimes absent (deceased), sometimes the source of magical power.

* **Queen Elinor (*Brave*)**: She represents "Order," "Tradition," and "Social Good." Her transformation into a Bear (a correspondence of "natural power" or "maternal protection") forces the integration of her "civilized" will with "natural" instinct. She must become "Natural" to understand her daughter.  
* **Sarabi (*The Lion King*)**: Her name means "Mirage," but she acts as the grounding force of the pride. She endures Scar’s reign with stoic dignity, representing the "Remains of the Church" waiting for restoration.  
* **Queen Athena (*The Little Mermaid*)**: Deceased. Represents the "Lost Love" or "Lost Good" that made the King (Truth) hard and bitter.  
* **Queen Iduna (*Frozen*)**: The source of the "Northuldra" (Nature/Magic) heritage. She represents the "Affection for Truth" that saved the father (Agnarr). Her lullaby is the "Voice of the Spheres" calling Elsa to her destiny.

### **4.3 The Princess: The Affection for Truth**

The Disney Princess is the protagonist because she represents the **Human Soul** (the *anima*) seeking **Regeneration**. In Swedenborg’s terms, she is the "Affection for Truth" wishing to be conjoined with "Truth" (The Prince) to form a "Conjugial Pair" (The Heavenly Marriage).

* **Ariel**: The "Affection for Natural Truth" (the human world). She seeks to rise from the "lower waters" (natural/sensual degree) to the "higher air" (spiritual/rational degree). Her acquisition of legs is the "incarnation" of the soul into a new state. Her struggle is the struggle of the soul to acquire immortality.  
* **Belle**: The "Affection for Spiritual Truth" (books/wisdom). She enters the "House of the Natural Man" (Beast) and, through "Conjugial Love" (marriage of Good and Truth), transforms him into a "Spiritual Man" (Prince).  
* **Rapunzel**: The "Light" (Wisdom) locked in a "Tower" (Selfhood/Isolation) by a "False Mother" (Gothel/Hypocrisy). Her hair is the "extension of truth" or "power" (like Samson’s hair ). Her cutting of the hair is the "vastation" or shedding of the external to find the internal.  
* **Snow White**: The "Innocence of the Soul." She is persecuted by the "Evil Queen" (Self-Love/Vanity). She must "die" (sleep) to the natural world to be awakened by "Divine Truth" (The Prince).

## **V. Transmission Vectors: How Correspondential Patterns Enter Cultural Production**

Given the structural alignment documented above, the question becomes: through what channels did these patterns enter Disney's narrative and visual language?

### **5.1 Direct vs. Indirect Transmission**

There is no evidence that Walt Disney or his core team studied Swedenborg directly. Disney's version of *Johnny Appleseed*, for instance, depicts the protagonist carrying a generic Bible rather than the Swedenborgian tracts that the historical John Chapman actually distributed. This absence of explicit Swedenborgian content makes the structural patterns all the more significant—they arrived through **cultural transmission** rather than conscious adoption.

### **5.2 The Indirect Transmission: The "Bricolage" of Culture**

However, the "Swedenborgian pattern" in Disney is undeniable. This is likely due to **indirect transmission** through the literary sources Disney adapted.

* **Hans Christian Andersen**: The author of *The Little Mermaid* and *The Snow Queen* was heavily influenced by Swedenborgian thought. Andersen’s concept of the mermaid earning an "immortal soul" is a direct reflection of Swedenborg’s doctrine of "degrees" of life (animal vs. human). When Disney adapted Andersen, the "bones" of this spiritual structure remained.  
* **The Brothers Grimm**: Influenced by German Romanticism (Schelling, Goethe), which in turn was deeply indebted to Swedenborg’s "nature philosophy". The Grimms’ tales often feature "talking animals" and "animate landscapes" that function as moral mirrors.  
* **Symbolism and Art Nouveau**: Disney’s "Golden Age" (Snow White, Pinocchio) and "Renaissance" (Beauty and the Beast) visual styles were heavily influenced by 19th-century European art (Rococo, Symbolism). Symbolist artists like Redon and Blake were explicit Swedenborgians. By adopting their visual language (e.g., the anthropomorphized trees in *Snow White*, the ethereal transformations in *Fantasia*), Disney animators imported the *aesthetic* of correspondence.  
* **Eyvind Earle and Medievalism**: For *Sleeping Beauty*, artist Eyvind Earle drew inspiration from the *Tres Riches Heures de Jean, Duc de Berry*, a medieval book of hours. Medieval art is inherently "correspondential," viewing the world as a book of symbols. By adopting this style, Disney adopted the pre-modern worldview of vertical causality.

### **5.3 The Jungian/Campbell Connection**

The most potent vector of influence in the "Disney Renaissance" (1989–1999) is **Joseph Campbell** and **Carl Jung**.

* It is documented that Disney screenwriters, particularly Christopher Vogler, explicitly used Campbell’s *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* as a blueprint for films like *The Lion King* and *Aladdin*.  
* Campbell and Jung were both profound students of Swedenborg. Jung read Swedenborg extensively, and his concept of the "Collective Unconscious" and "Archetypes" mirrors Swedenborg’s "World of Spirits" and "Correspondences".  
* **Conclusion**: Disney movies follow Swedenborgian patterns because they follow **Archetypal** patterns. Swedenborg was one of the first modern Western thinkers to map these archetypes systematically. Disney animators, tapping into the "Collective Unconscious" (or the "Mundus Imaginalis" ), retrieved the same symbols Swedenborg observed.

## **VI. Case Studies in Correspondence**

### **6.1 *The Lion King*: The Grand Man and the Body Politic**

*The Lion King* serves as a perfect model of Swedenborg’s **Maximus Homo** (The Grand Man). The Kingdom is a body. Mufasa is the "Head" (Wisdom/Government). The Lionesses are the "Heart/Lungs" (Vital operations). The Hyenas are the "Intestines/Excretory function" (consuming waste, living in the "Elephant Graveyard" of bones). When Scar (the Cancer/Disease/Self-Love) takes over the Head, the entire Body (Land) sickens. The "circle of life" is broken. The "Rain" that returns with Simba is the "Influx of Truth" that heals the body. Zazu, the bird, is the "Communicating/Nervous System" trying to maintain connection between the parts.

### **6.2 *Tangled*: The Tower as the Proprium**

Rapunzel represents the **Remains** (innocence stored by the Lord) locked within the **Tower of Selfhood** (Proprium). Mother Gothel represents **Hypocrisy**—she feigns love to exploit the "truth/power" (hair) for her own selfish life (youth).

* **The Lanterns**: Correspond to "Heavenly Truths" or "Stars" seen from a distance.  
* **The Hair**: Corresponds to "The Letter of the Word" or "Natural Truth"—it has power and healing, but can be used for evil if controlled by the Self (Gothel).  
* **Eugene/Flynn**: Represents the "Worldly Intellect" (thief) who must be "reformed" by the "Innocence" of Rapunzel. His "dying to self" (cutting the hair/sacrificing his life) is the act that breaks the spell of the Proprium.

### **6.3 *Beauty and the Beast*: Reformation of the Natural Man**

The Beast is the **Natural Man** ruled by **Lusts** (fur, claws, anger). He is "rich" but "unhappy" (spiritual poverty).

* **Belle**: The **Internal Spiritual Man** (Conscience). She enters the Beast’s domain.  
* **The Rose**: The **Vital Heat** or **Remains of Good**—if it withers completely, the man is spiritually dead (profaned).  
* **The Mirror**: The **Word** or **Self-Examination**. It shows "what is wanted" (truth).  
* **Gaston**: The **Self-Righteousness** or **Pride of Self-Intelligence**. He is "beautiful" on the outside but "beastly" inside (Swedenborg’s description of the hypocrite). The Beast is "ugly" outside but becomes "beautiful" inside through regeneration.

## **VII. Conclusion: Animation as Applied Correspondences**

The analysis confirms that Disney movies follow a pattern matching Swedenborg’s theory of correspondence to a high degree of fidelity. Landscapes reflect the state of the kingdom/mind; animals represent specific affections and intellectual principles; and royal lineages map onto the interplay of Truth and Good.

Two factors account for this convergence:

**First, the nature of the medium itself.** Animation *requires* externalization: an emotion must be drawn as a storm; a personality must be drawn as an animal; an internal transformation must manifest as visible change in the environment. This artistic necessity aligns the medium with Swedenborg's vision of a world where internal states are made visible in external forms. Animators rediscover the "Science of Correspondences" through the demands of their craft.

**Second, the lineage of the source material.** By adapting fairy tales from Andersen and Grimm, drawing on Symbolist and medieval visual traditions, and utilizing Campbell's archetypal structures, Disney inherited narrative and aesthetic frameworks already shaped by Swedenborgian, Neoplatonic, and Romantic influences. The transmission was indirect but substantial.

The "Magic" of Disney is, in a structural sense, the successful execution of the Doctrine of Correspondences: making the spiritual visible, externalizing the internal, and presenting a world where environment responds to character. Whether this reflects something true about the nature of symbolism itself—that correspondences describe real relationships rather than arbitrary conventions—is precisely what the Swedenborgian framework proposes.

### **Summary Table of Verified Correspondences in Disney**

| **The Princess** | **Affection for Truth / The Soul** | Ariel (longing for higher world), Belle (longing for understanding) |
| **The Horse** | **Intellect / Understanding** | Maximus (Law), Samson (Power), Philippe (Natural/Fearful) |
| **The Dog** | **Natural Affection / Loyalty** | Bruno, Max, Percy, Sultan (Footstool) |
