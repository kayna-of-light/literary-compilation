## Phased Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Epistemological Clarification (CRITICAL)
**Timeframe**: Immediate  
**Questions**: 6 HIGH priority epistemological  
**Systems**: Gemini Deep Research (all 6)  
**Goal**: Clarify framework's intellectual status—theology or integrated science?

**Questions**:
1. Two-Tiered Epistemology: Philosophical Assessment
2. Falsification Criteria for Correspondence Doctrine
3. Historical-Critical Method Applied to Swedenborg
4. Confirmation Bias Safeguards
5. Parsimony Test vs. Simpler Theories
6. Framework Success Criteria

**Expected Outcome**: Framework either:
- Specifies falsifiability criteria and maintains epistemological integration claim, OR
- Acknowledges unfalsifiability and reframes as theological hermeneutic

---

### Phase 2: Empirical Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Timeframe**: After Phase 1  
**Questions**: 5 HIGH priority empirical  
**Systems**: NDE Statistical Repository (all 5)  
**Goal**: Replace anecdotes with statistical distributions

**Questions**:
1. Life Review Empathetic Component Frequency
2. Distressing NDEs Statistical Breakdown
3. Veridical Perception Verification Rates
4. DOPS Overall Verification Rates
5. Being Identification Cross-Cultural Data

**Expected Outcome**: Statistical context for all consciousness claims; cherry-picking addressed

---

### Phase 3: Methodological Strengthening (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Timeframe**: Parallel with Phase 2  
**Questions**: 4 HIGH + 6 MEDIUM methodological  
**Systems**: GDR (8), NLM (2)  
**Goal**: Address methodological asymmetry, engage alternatives seriously

**Questions**:
1. CDE vs. Dual Inheritance Theory
2. Dying Brain Hypothesis Evidence
3. Independent Validation of Correspondences
4. Oral Tradition Stability
5. Swedenborg Doctrine Evolution (MEDIUM)
6. Swedenborg 18th-Century Context (MEDIUM)
7. [+ 4 more MEDIUM questions]

**Expected Outcome**: Methodologically consistent framework; alternatives steelmanned

---

### Phase 4: Domain Expansion (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Timeframe**: After Phases 1-3  
**Questions**: Remaining 8 MEDIUM  
**Systems**: GDR (5), NLM (2), NDE (1)  
**Goal**: Strengthen underrepresented domains

**Expected Outcome**: Biblical Scholarship ≥18%, Gnostic Analysis ≥12%, balanced coverage

---

### Phase 5: Integration & Validation (ONGOING)
**Timeframe**: Continuous  
**Questions**: 7 LOW + 6 INTEGRATION  
**Systems**: GDR (9), NLM (2), NDE (2)  
**Goal**: Cross-domain consistency, peripheral validation

**Expected Outcome**: Framework demonstrates internal coherence across all domains

## Critical Dependencies

### ⚠️ BLOCKERS: Must Resolve Before Framework Advancement

1. **Epistemological Status** (Phase 1)
   - Framework claims "epistemological integration" but operates as hermeneutic interpretation
   - **Block**: Cannot advance knowledge claims until status clarified
   - **Resolution**: Phase 1 questions #1-6

2. **Falsification Criteria** (Phase 1)
   - Central claims acknowledged as unfalsifiable in knowledge graph
   - **Block**: Cannot call unfalsifiable claims "knowledge" per philosophy of science
   - **Resolution**: Specify disconfirming conditions OR reframe as faith commitments

3. **Methodological Asymmetry** (Phase 3)
   - HCM applied to Bible but not Swedenborg
   - **Block**: Double standard undermines scholarly credibility
   - **Resolution**: Apply HCM to Swedenborg OR acknowledge differential treatment

### 🔄 HIGH IMPACT: Significant Revision Potential

4. **Statistical Context for Empirical Claims** (Phase 2)
   - Framework emphasizes anecdotal cases; lacks overall rates
   - **Impact**: Cherry-picking accusation; inflated evidential strength
   - **Resolution**: Phase 2 questions #1-5 (NDE repository)

5. **Alternative Theory Engagement** (Phase 3)
   - Simpler naturalist theories inadequately addressed
   - **Impact**: Occam's Razor challenge; framework must show unique value
   - **Resolution**: CDE vs. DIT, dying brain analysis

## Integration with Knowledge Graph

### Current Graph Status
- **Total Nodes**: 113
- **Total Connections**: 399
- **Trace Status Complete**: ~65%
- **Trace Status Partial**: ~25%
- **Trace Status Needed**: ~10%

### Post-Research Integration Plan

As research questions are resolved:

1. **@source-tracer** updates source chains with findings
2. **@knowledge-compiler** creates new nodes or updates existing
3. **Trace status** updated from partial/needed → complete
4. **Caveats** added based on research findings
5. **Confidence levels** adjusted (preliminary → validated or contested)
6. **Connections** established to new evidence/concepts

### Expected Graph Growth

- **New Nodes**: +20-30 (primarily BIBL, GNOS, CROSS domains)
- **Source Chains**: 80%+ complete trace status
- **Caveats**: All contested claims documented
- **Evidence**: Empirical statistics added to CONSC nodes
