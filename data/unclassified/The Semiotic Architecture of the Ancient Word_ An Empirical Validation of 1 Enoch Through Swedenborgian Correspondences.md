# **The Semiotic Architecture of the Ancient Word: An Empirical Validation of 1 Enoch Through Swedenborgian Correspondences**

## **1\. Introduction: The Epistemological Crisis of the Lost Canon**

The theological corpus of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) posits one of the most audacious historiographical claims in the history of religious thought: the existence of a primordial, pre-Mosaic scripture known as the "Ancient Word" (*Verbum Vetustum*). According to Swedenborg, this text was not merely a collection of myths or moral fables, but a divinely inspired document written entirely in the language of "correspondences"—a universal semiotic code where natural objects, numbers, and historical events function as ontological containers for specific spiritual realities.1

Swedenborg explicitly claimed that this Ancient Word was preserved in "Great Tartary" (Central Asia) and that specific books mentioned in the Hebrew Bible—such as the *Wars of Jehovah* and the *Book of Jashar*—were remnants of this lost canon.3 Crucially, for the purpose of this investigation, he also identified the "Book of Enoch" as a text derived from the perceptive tradition of the "Most Ancient Church," a text that preserved the doctrinal wisdom of the earliest epoch of human spirituality.1

For nearly two centuries, this claim remained a matter of faith for the New Church and a curiosity for secular scholars. The "Book of Enoch" was assumed lost to the West, known only through patristic fragments. However, the rediscovery of the Ethiopic *1 Enoch* by James Bruce in 1773, and the subsequent discovery of Aramaic fragments among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran in 1947, provided a material text upon which Swedenborg’s hermeneutic hypotheses could be tested.6

Traditional biblical criticism has largely disqualified *1 Enoch* from the canon based on two primary filters: **Dating** (classifying it as a pseudepigraphal work from the Hellenistic period, c. 300 BC–100 AD) and **Literacy** (viewing its wild imagery as the product of apocalyptic sectarianism rather than divine inspiration). However, Swedenborg’s "Science of Correspondences" offers a different metric for canonization. It ignores the historical date of the penman and focuses on the **Internal Sense**. If a text is truly part of the Ancient Word lineage, it must exhibit **Vertical Causality**—a structural property where every detail (number, animal, color, calendar day) is dictated not by the author’s literary preference, but by the immutable laws of spiritual influx.2

This research report undertakes a rigorous, unbiased "stress test" of *1 Enoch* by removing the disqualifiers of dating and authorship. We accept the text as a given data set and apply Swedenborg’s correspondential keys directly to its most granular details. The objective is to determine if *1 Enoch* functions as a "Representative" text—a vessel of the Ancient Word’s internal sense—or if it fails the test of spiritual uniformity.

The investigation focuses on three specific hermeneutic pressure points:

1. **The Uniformity Test:** We analyze the controversial identification of Enoch as the "Son of Man" in the *Book of Parables* (1 Enoch 37–71). Does this deification of a patriarch violate the Swedenborgian tenet that the "Son of Man" is a title exclusive to the Lord (Divine Truth), or can Enoch function as a "Representative" without breaking the internal consistency of the Word?.9  
2. **The Astronomical Correspondence Test:** We perform a granular analysis of the *Astronomical Book* (1 Enoch 72–82). Instead of dismissing the 364-day calendar as "failed science," we test it as "Theology by Geometry." Can the 364-day year, the 4 intercalary days, and the lag of the moon be decoded using Swedenborg’s meanings for Sun (Love), Moon (Faith), and numbers (7, 52, 364)?.11  
3. **The Compilation Test:** We compare the *Animal Apocalypse* (1 Enoch 85–90) with the redactive nature of the Pentateuch. Does the "Internal Sense" survive the compilation process in *1 Enoch*? Does the sequence of animals (White Bull → Sheep → White Bull) map onto the Swedenborgian cycle of churches (Celestial → Spiritual → New Church)?.12

If *1 Enoch* survives these tests, it validates Swedenborg’s claim regarding the existence and nature of the Ancient Word. If it fails, it confirms the text as a "human" apocryphon, devoid of the infinite series characteristic of the Divine style.

**2\. Part I: The Uniformity Test — The ‘Son of Man’ Controversy**

The *Book of Parables* (1 Enoch 37–71) constitutes the theological core of the Enochic corpus. It presents a sophisticated messianic eschatology centered on a pre-existent figure known variously as the "Son of Man" (*Walda Sab’*), the "Elect One" (*Hirut*), and the "Righteous One" (*Tsadq*).14 Throughout the visions, Enoch observes this figure as distinct from himself—a heavenly judge who sits on the Throne of Glory, existent before the creation of the stars.15

However, the narrative arc concludes with a textual event that has scandalized theologians and confused translators for a century. In Chapter 71, Enoch is translated to the "heaven of heavens," where he is greeted by the Deity (the "Head of Days") and the angels. In verse 14, the angel Michael declares to Enoch:  
"You are that Son of Man who was born for righteousness, and righteousness dwells on you, and the righteousness of the Head of Days will not forsake you." (1 Enoch 71:14).16  
This direct identification ("You are") transforms the text from a vision *of* the Messiah into an apotheosis *of* the visionary. Early translators, most notably R.H. Charles, found this so theologically incompatible with the preceding chapters (and Christian theology) that he emended the text to read **"This is the Son of Man,"** arguing that a passage describing the Son of Man’s arrival must have been lost.16 However, the consensus of modern scholarship—based on the integrity of the Ethiopic manuscripts—is that "You are" is the original reading.14

For a Swedenborgian analysis, this presents a critical "Uniformity" problem. Swedenborg’s theology is emphatically monistic regarding the Human of the Lord. He teaches that the title "Son of Man" belongs **exclusively** to the Lord (Jesus Christ) as the Incarnate Word or Divine Truth.10 If *1 Enoch* attributes this title to a created being (Enoch), does it violate the internal sense? Or is there a deeper hermeneutic key—specifically the doctrine of **Representatives**—that resolves this tension?

### **2.1 The Swedenborgian Definition of the "Son of Man"**

To perform the stress test, we must first rigorously define the correspondential value of the title. In the Swedenborgian lexicon, titles of the Divine are not poetic honorifics but precise designators of spiritual function.

* **Son of God:** Corresponds to the Lord as to the **Divine Human** or the **Divine Good**. It refers to the essence of life and love originating from the Father (Jehovah). It is the Lord's "Soul" or "Internal" manifest.19  
* **Son of Man:** Corresponds to the Lord as to the **Word** or **Divine Truth**. It refers to the form of truth accommodated to human reception. It is the aspect of the Divine that can be "tempted," that "suffers," and that "judges" (since all judgment is effected by truth).19

Swedenborg explicitly addresses the apparent contradiction of prophets being called "son of man" (ben-adam) in the Old Testament. He states:

"The Lord called himself the son of man because he was the Word or Divine truth... The same was signified by 'prophet,' because the prophets taught truths from the Word; and therefore the Lord, who was a prophet in a pre-eminent degree... called himself... the son of man. This is why... the prophets themselves were called sons of man, as Ezekiel... and also Daniel.".17

This passage provides the essential key for our stress test. A human prophet is called "son of man" not because he is the Messiah, but because he **represents the Word**. In the language of correspondence, the "Person" is obliterated, and only the "Function" remains. Ezekiel is addressed as "son of man" over 90 times to signify that he represented the "Doctrine of Truth" identifying the sins of Israel.21

### **2.2 The Representative Hypothesis: Enoch as Doctrine**

If *1 Enoch* is a valid correspondential text, the character "Enoch" must function not as a historical biography, but as a spiritual representation. Swedenborg identifies "Enoch" not merely as a man, but as a "community" or "church" that collected the perceptions of the Most Ancient Church and reduced them into doctrine.1

* **Enoch \= Collected Doctrine from Perception.**  
* **Son of Man \= Divine Truth / The Word.**

When we apply these values to the controversial verse 71:14 ("You are that Son of Man"), the proposition transforms from a heretical apotheosis into a profound theological tautology:  
"This Doctrine (Enoch) is the Divine Truth (Son of Man)."  
The text describes the **elevation of Doctrine**. Throughout the *Book of Parables*, Enoch (the Doctrine/Prophet) gazes at the Son of Man (the Divine Truth) from a distance. He sees Truth as an external object of vision—something "other." In the final chapter, the Prophet is translated into the "Heaven of Heavens" (the Celestial State). In this state, the distinction between the *Instrument* (Doctrine) and the *Source* (Truth) collapses. The Doctrine is seen to *be* the Truth itself in form.

This mirrors the Swedenborgian concept of **Glorification**. The Lord’s human (Son of Man) was initially distinct from the Father, but through the process of glorification, it became one with the Father. Similarly, the "Ancient Word" (represented by Enoch) is initially a collection of perceptions, but in its highest form, it is identified as the Divine Truth itself.

### **2.3 The "Righteousness" Confirmation**

The text of 71:14 further supports this reading through the attribute of "Righteousness" (*Sedeq*):

"You are that Son of Man who was born for righteousness, and righteousness dwells on you..."

In Swedenborgian correspondences:

* **Righteousness (*Sedeq*):** Corresponds to **Divine Good** or the **Merit of the Lord**.14 It is the quality of the Divine Will/Love.  
* **Dwelling:** Signifies **Conjunction** or the marriage of two principles.

The statement that "Righteousness dwells on you" describes the **Heavenly Marriage** of Good and Truth. The "Son of Man" (Truth) serves as the vessel for "Righteousness" (Good). Enoch is told that he is the Son of Man because, in his representative capacity as the scribe of the Ancient Word, he is the vessel in which Divine Good (Righteousness) dwells via Divine Truth (Doctrine).

### **2.4 Resolution of the "You are" vs. "This is" Debate**

This analysis resolves the scholarly tension over the translation.

* **R.H. Charles ("This is"):** Attempted to preserve the distinction between the human Enoch and the divine Messiah, assuming a literal/historical reading.  
* **Ethiopic Text ("You are"):** Preserves the **Representative** reading.

In the Science of Correspondences, "You are" is the only valid reading. In the state of vision, the representative *is* the thing represented. When David spoke in the Psalms, he *was* the King (Divine Truth). When Enoch stands before the Head of Days, he *is* the Son of Man (The Word). The text describes the spiritual reality where the "Prophet" becomes transparent, and only the "Word" remains.

**Verdict of the Uniformity Test:** *1 Enoch* passes. The identification of Enoch as the Son of Man does not violate the uniqueness of the Lord; rather, it affirms the Swedenborgian doctrine that the Word (Son of Man) appears *as* the Prophet in the state of revelation. The text accurately depicts the **Glorification of the Word**—the realization that the Doctrine of the Ancient Church (Enoch) was, in its essence, the Divine Truth (Son of Man).

**3\. Part II: The Astronomical Correspondence Test — 1 Enoch 72-82**

The *Astronomical Book* (1 Enoch 72–82) is the oldest section of the corpus. It details a solar calendar of **364 days**, contrasting it with a lunar calendar of 354 days. Secular scholarship views this as a "sectarian" scientific document, likely produced by the Qumran community or its predecessors to oppose the lunar calendar of the Jerusalem Temple.22 The "science" is often deemed primitive or erroneous because the solar year is actually \~365.25 days.

However, Swedenborg asserts that in the Ancient Word, numbers and measurements were not quantitative data but **qualitative symbols** of spiritual states.24 "To number" means "to know the quality".24 We apply the "Astronomical Correspondence Test" to determine if the 364-day calendar represents a coherent "Theology of State."

### **3.1 The Semiotics of the Solar Calendar (364 Days)**

The Enochian year is structured as follows:

* 12 Months of 30 days.  
* 4 Intercalary Days (one for each season).  
* **Total:** $12 \\times 30 \+ 4 \= 364$ days.11

Mathematical Structure:  
$364 \= 52 \\times 7$.  
The year is perfectly divisible by 7\. This means that every year begins on the same day of the week (Wednesday, the 4th day, corresponding to the creation of the luminaries).26  
**Swedenborgian Key:**

* **The Sun:** Corresponds to the **Lord as Divine Love**.27  
* **The Number 7:** Corresponds to the **Celestial State**, the **Holy**, and the **Sabbath** (Rest/Peace).28 It signifies the full state of regeneration where man is led by the Lord.28  
* **The Number 52:** A derivative of 50 (Fullness) and remains.

**Analysis:** The 364-day calendar is a **Sabbatical Solar System**. It subordinates "astronomical reality" (365.25) to "spiritual reality" (7). In the Swedenborgian worldview, the **Most Ancient Church** (represented by Enoch/Adam) was a **Celestial Church**—it lived in a state of perpetual Sabbath, ruled directly by the Lord’s Love (Sun).29

A calendar that drifts from the physical sun (by 1.25 days a year) but remains locked to the *Sabbath* (7) signifies a church that prioritizes **State** (Quality/Holiness) over **Time** (Quantity/Motion). Swedenborg explicitly states that "angels have no notion of time" but only of "state".30 The 364-day year ensures that the "holiness" of the number 7 touches every aspect of the cycle without remainder.

* **The Remainder Problem:** A 365-day year introduces a remainder ($365 / 7 \= 52$ weeks \+ 1 day). In correspondence, a "remainder" or "residue" signifies something not included in the holy state—a profanation, or the presence of the human proprium (self-hood) interfering with the Divine Order.  
* **The Enochian Solution:** The refusal to acknowledge the 365th day is a semiotic refusal to acknowledge a state outside the Sabbath. It describes a "Celestial" perception where the entire cycle of life is perfectly ordered by the Holy (7) and Love (Sun).

### **3.2 The Four Intercalary Days (The Leaders)**

Enoch 82:4-6 describes 4 intercalary days that are "not reckoned" in the numbering of the months but are "leaders" that separate the four seasons.31

* "On account of them men go wrong... for they belong to the reckoning of the year."

**Swedenborgian Key:**

* **Four Quarters:** In the spiritual world, the four quarters (East, West, South, North) are not fixed compass points but determinations of **State**. East \= Love (Lord); South \= Wisdom; West \= Declining Love; North \= Obscurity/Cold.27  
* **Intercalation:** Something "inserted" or "between" to maintain order.  
* **Number 4:** Signifies **Conjunction** or union (derived from pairs, 2+2).28

**Analysis:** The four intercalary days represent the **Transitions of State** in the regeneration process. The "Year" (the regenerate life) is divided into states of Heat (Love) and Light (Wisdom).

* The "4 Days" are the **Spiritual Nodes** or **Hinges** that connect these states.  
* They are called "Leaders" because every change of state in regeneration is led by the Lord.  
* They are "not reckoned" in the months because they act as the invisible adjusters of the soul’s "year." They represent the **Divine Influx** that bridges the gap between states.  
* **Going Wrong:** The text warns that men "go wrong" if they ignore these days. Spiritually, this means if man ignores the Divine "Leaders" (the influx of the Lord at transition points), the cycle of regeneration (the Year) falls into disorder. The "exactness" of the year depends on acknowledging the Lord's role in the transitions.

### **3.3 The Solar vs. Lunar Conflict: Love vs. Faith**

*1 Enoch* 74 contrasts the Solar year (364) with the Lunar year (354).11 The Moon "falls behind" the Sun by 10 days annually.

* "The moon falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30 days \[in 3 years\]...".11

**Swedenborgian Key:**

* **Sun:** Divine Love / Will / Celestial Principle.34  
* **Moon:** Divine Truth / Faith / Spiritual Principle.34  
* **Lag/Discrepancy:** The disagreement or separation between the Will and the Understanding.

**Analysis:** This astronomical "error" describes the **Fall of Man** or the distinction between the **Celestial** and **Spiritual** churches.

1. **Solar Calendar (364):** Represents the **Celestial Man** (Most Ancient Church). His Will (Sun) and Understanding act as one. He lives a "364-day" life—full, complete, holy. There is no lag.  
2. **Lunar Calendar (354):** Represents the **Spiritual Man** (Ancient/Jewish Church). His Understanding (Moon/Faith) is separated from his Will. His Faith (Moon) is not fully equal to the Love (Sun). He "lags behind" the full state of regeneration.  
3. **The 10 Days:** The difference is 10 days. In Swedenborg, **10** signifies **Remains**—truths and goods stored up by the Lord in the internal man to prevent spiritual death.28 The Spiritual Church (Moon) relies on "Remains" (10) to bridge the gap to the Celestial (Sun).

**Insight:** The Qumran/Enochian polemic against the Lunar calendar (used by the Pharisees/Mainstream Judaism) was not merely about dates; it was a **Spiritual Polemic**. They were asserting that the True Church must be ruled by **Love (Sun)**, not just **Faith/Torah (Moon)**. They viewed the Lunar calendar as a sign of spiritual decline—a "falling behind" the perfect order of the Celestial state. The *Astronomical Book* is a semiotic defense of **Celestial Love** against the "lagging" nature of **Faith Alone**.

**Verdict of the Astronomical Test:** *1 Enoch* 72–82 passes. The text constructs a coherent **Theology of Time** that aligns perfectly with Swedenborg’s distinction between Celestial (Sun/364) and Spiritual (Moon/354) states. The "pseudoscientific" elements are revealed to be precise spiritual symbols.

**4\. Part III: The Compilation vs. Redaction Test — The Animal Apocalypse**

The *Animal Apocalypse* (1 Enoch 85–90) recounts the history of the world from Adam to the Maccabees using a complex allegory of animals. Unlike the Pentateuch, which Swedenborg describes as having a seamless internal sense despite its redaction (J, E, P sources), *1 Enoch* is often viewed as a "patchwork" compilation. This test determines if the **Animal Sequence** in *1 Enoch* maintains the "Internal Sense" or if the compilation process fractured the correspondence.

### **4.1 The Animal Sequence**

The text categorizes humanity into three distinct animal types:

1. **Bulls:** From Adam to Isaac.12  
2. **Sheep:** From Jacob (Israel) to the end of the era.13  
3. **Wild Beasts:** The Gentile nations (Wolves, Lions, Boars).13  
4. **Transformation:** In the eschaton, the Messiah appears as a **White Bull**, and all Sheep/Beasts transform back into White Bulls.36

### **4.2 Swedenborgian Correspondence Analysis**

**A. The White Bull (Adam/Seth/Noah)**

* **Text:** Adam is a White Bull. Seth is a White Bull.  
* **Swedenborgian Key:** A "Bull" or "Ox" (*Shor*) signifies **Natural Good** or the **Good of Innocence in the external man**.37  
* **Analysis:** Why would the "Most Ancient Church" (Adam), which Swedenborg calls "Celestial" (the highest state), be represented by a Bull (Natural Good)?  
  * **The Celestial-Natural:** Swedenborg teaches that the Most Ancient people were in the "innocence of ignorance." Their good was powerful, instinctive, and grounded in the affection of life—a state perfectly captured by the **White Bull**. They were "Celestial-Natural"—living in the order of nature, with affections as strong and uncorrupted as a virile animal.  
  * **Color Key:**  
    * **White:** Truth/Purity (Adam/Seth).  
    * **Red:** The Good of Love (Abel) or Violence (Blood).  
    * **Black:** Evil/Falsity (Cain).13

**B. The Transformation to Sheep (Jacob)**

* **Text:** Isaac is a Bull, but Jacob is born a **White Sheep**. From this point, Israel is a flock.  
* **Swedenborgian Key:** A "Sheep" signifies **Spiritual Good** (Charity) and **Patience**.37  
* **Analysis:** This shift marks the precise transition from the **Celestial Church** to the **Spiritual Church**.  
  * **Celestial (Bull):** Ruled by Will/Love. Instinctive. Powerful.  
  * **Spiritual (Sheep):** Ruled by Intellect/Conscience. Defenseless. Needs a Shepherd.  
  * Swedenborg teaches that after the "Flood" (the destruction of the Most Ancient Will), the Lord separated the Will and Understanding to save mankind. A new church (Ancient/Spiritual) was formed via **Conscience** in the understanding. A "Sheep" is the perfect symbol for this state: it is easily led astray (requires doctrine/shepherd), is non-violent (charity), and is characterized by "following" (obedience) rather than "power" (instinct). The text’s shift from Bull to Sheep perfectly mirrors the **Dispensational Shift** in Swedenborg’s history.

**C. The Eschatological White Bull (1 Enoch 90:37)**

* **Text:** In the end, a "White Bull" is born (Messiah). All the Sheep and Wild Beasts transform into White Bulls.  
* **Analysis:** This is the most stunning confirmation of the Internal Sense.  
  * **The Cycle:** If history is a decline from Celestial (Bull) to Spiritual (Sheep), the Restoration must be a return to the Celestial.  
  * **The New Church:** Swedenborg teaches that the **New Jerusalem** is the "Crown of Churches," returning to the state of the Golden Age but with the fullness of acquired wisdom. The return to the **White Bull** signifies the restoration of the **Good of Innocence** and the **Celestial Will**.  
  * **Internal Consistency:** If the text were merely a Maccabean nationalist tract, the Messiah should be a "Great Ram" (super-Israelite) or a "Lion" (Conqueror). By reverting to the "Bull" (Adam), the text reveals a theology of **Restoration** (Circular History) rather than **Evolution** (Linear History). It confirms that the goal of providence is the recovery of the "Celestial-Natural" innocence of the Most Ancient Church.

### **4.3 The Compilation Result**

Despite being a "compilation" of traditions, the *Animal Apocalypse* exhibits a **Unified Internal Sense**. The redactor who stitched these visions together did not break the semiotic chain. The symbols (Bull $\\to$ Sheep $\\to$ Bull) follow a rigid spiritual logic that transcends the historical or political intent of the human author (who likely supported Judas Maccabeus).

* **Comparison to Canon:** Just as the "Redactor" of Genesis preserved the distinct styles of J (Jehovah/Love) and P (Elohim/Truth) because they corresponded to Celestial and Spiritual states 39, the "Redactor" of *1 Enoch* preserved the animal sequence because it corresponded to the Dispensational History of the Church.

**Verdict of the Compilation Test:** *1 Enoch* passes. The "Internal Sense" survives the editing process, suggesting that the underlying visions were derived from a genuine perceptive tradition (the Ancient Word) that imposed its own structure on the text.

## ---

**5\. Synthesis: The Enochian 'Missing Link'**

The stress tests reveal that *1 Enoch* exhibits a high degree of **Structural Isomorphism** with Swedenborg’s system, behaving more like "The Word" than "The Writings" in its semiotic density.

### **5.1 The Theology of Structure**

*1 Enoch* is obsessed with **Order** (Cosmic, Calendar, History). Swedenborg defines "Divine Truth" as "Order." The text’s rigid 364-day calendar is not failed science; it is a **Liturgical Geometrization** of the Divine Order, ensuring that Time (Natural) is fully subjugated to State (Spiritual). It is a "Theology of the Sabbath."

### **5.2 The Representative Prophet**

The identification of Enoch as the Son of Man in Chapter 71 resolves the tension between "Person" and "Office." It provides a bridge to understanding how the "Word" becomes "Flesh." Enoch represents the **Word in Heaven** (Ancient Word) before it became the **Word on Earth** (Jesus).

### **5.3 The Recovery of the Celestial**

The recurring theme of the "White Bull" and the "Solar Year" indicates that *1 Enoch* is a repository of **Celestial Theology** (Love/Will). The canonical Old Testament (Law/Prophets) is largely **Spiritual Theology** (Truth/Intellect/Obedience). *1 Enoch* preserves the "Love" dialect (Sun/Bull) that complements the "Law" dialect (Moon/Sheep) of the Mosaic canon.

## ---

**6\. Conclusion: A Validated Vessel**

This rigorous stress test concludes that *1 Enoch*, specifically the portions analyzed, withstands the pressure of Swedenborgian hermeneutics without shattering.

1. **Uniformity:** The "Son of Man" controversy is resolved by the law of **Representation**, affirming Enoch as a figure of the Word/Doctrine.  
2. **Astronomy:** The 364-day calendar is validated as a **Symbol of the Celestial State**, prioritizing Sabbatical holiness (7) over natural precision.  
3. **Redaction:** The *Animal Apocalypse* preserves the precise spiritual sequence of the Churches (Bull/Celestial $\\to$ Sheep/Spiritual $\\to$ Bull/New Church).

**Final Verdict:** *1 Enoch* functions semiotically as a **Representative Text**. While it may not possess the unbroken, infinite internal series of the Hebrew Pentateuch (due to textual corruption and translation), it contains **islands of the Ancient Word**. It is a "Broken Tablet"—its jagged edges fit perfectly into the missing gaps of Swedenborg’s spiritual history. For the Swedenborgian scholar, *1 Enoch* is not merely Apocrypha; it is a **Testament of the Celestial Church**, a witness to the time when the Sun (Love) ruled the year, before the Moon (Faith) became the light of the dark night of history.
