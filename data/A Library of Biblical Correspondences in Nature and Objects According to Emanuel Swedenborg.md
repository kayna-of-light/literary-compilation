# **A Library of Biblical Correspondences in Nature and Objects According to Emanuel Swedenborg**

## **1\. Introduction: Emanuel Swedenborg and Biblical Interpretation**

Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), a Swedish scientist, philosopher, and theologian, developed a unique and complex system of biblical interpretation centered on what he termed the "doctrine of correspondences". This doctrine posits a fundamental, dynamic relationship between the spiritual world (the realm of causes, thoughts, and affections) and the natural, physical world (the realm of effects, actions, and objects). According to Swedenborg, everything existing in the natural world is an ultimate effect that corresponds to, represents, and signifies something on a higher, spiritual plane. This includes not only the structure of the human body and the phenomena of nature but also, crucially, the literal text of the Bible.  
Swedenborg asserted that the Bible, or the Word, was written entirely according to these correspondences, meaning its historical narratives, laws, prophecies, and even seemingly mundane details contain an inner, spiritual sense that relates to divine truths, the process of human spiritual development (regeneration), the nature of heaven and hell, and the Lord Himself. He believed the literal sense serves as a necessary foundation and container for these deeper meanings, much like a body contains a soul. Accessing this spiritual sense, he argued, requires understanding the specific correspondences of the words, objects, figures, and events described in the text. His extensive theological works, particularly *Arcana Coelestia* (an exposition of Genesis and Exodus) and *Apocalypse Revealed*/*Apocalypse Explained* (expositions of Revelation), provide detailed, verse-by-verse analyses based on this system.  
This report aims to compile a library of specific correspondences as described by Swedenborg, focusing on natural elements, living creatures, plants, and common objects frequently mentioned in the Bible. The focus is on the inherent symbolic meaning Swedenborg attributed to these items themselves, rather than interpretations derived solely from narrative context, fulfilling the specific requirement to isolate the symbol's core correspondence \[User Query Point 7\]. The information is drawn from Swedenborg's own theological writings and authoritative secondary sources compiling his system.

## **2\. The Doctrine of Correspondences Explained**

The core of Swedenborg's hermeneutic is the "doctrine of correspondences," a term he coined to describe the inherent relationship between spiritual causes and natural effects. It is not merely a system of arbitrary symbols but a description of the fundamental structure of reality, where the natural world is a continuous manifestation or "theatre representative" of the spiritual world, which in turn manifests the Divine. Everything in nature, from the grandest celestial bodies to the smallest plant, exists because of a spiritual cause and purpose originating from the Divine.  
**Key Principles:**

* **Spiritual-Natural Link:** There is a constant influx from the spiritual world into the natural world, sustaining its existence and imbuing it with meaning. The natural world is the plane of effects, while the spiritual world is the plane of causes.  
* **Love and Wisdom:** The ultimate reality, God, is Divine Love (the source of all affection and life, corresponding to heat) and Divine Wisdom (the source of all form and order, corresponding to light). These two emanate from the Divine and create and sustain all things. The spiritual sun, seen by angels, is the first emanation of this Divine Love and Wisdom, its heat corresponding to love and its light to wisdom. The natural sun corresponds to this spiritual sun.  
* **Hierarchical Levels (Discrete Degrees):** Reality consists of distinct levels or "degrees"—celestial (love-based), spiritual (wisdom/truth-based), and natural (effect-based). Each lower level corresponds to and is sustained by the level above it. The human mind mirrors this structure, possessing internal (spiritual) and external (natural) aspects.  
* **Correspondence in the Word:** The Bible was written using natural language and imagery that correspond perfectly to spiritual and celestial truths. The literal sense provides the necessary base, while the spiritual sense contains the divine wisdom accessible through understanding correspondences. The Lord Himself spoke in correspondences (parables).  
* **Double Meanings:** Because humanity fell from its original state of perceiving correspondences directly, many symbols in the Word have both a positive (good) sense, relating to heavenly qualities, and a negative (opposite) sense, relating to hellish qualities or perversions of the good. Context determines which sense applies.  
* **Ancient Knowledge:** Swedenborg claimed this knowledge of correspondences was central to ancient civilizations (the "Ancient Word") but was gradually lost, leading eventually to idolatry where the representations were worshipped instead of the spiritual realities they signified. He saw his work as restoring this lost key to understanding.

Understanding this doctrine is essential for interpreting the specific symbols detailed in the following sections. It provides the framework demonstrating that these meanings are not arbitrary but are rooted in Swedenborg's systematic view of a divinely ordered, interconnected reality.

## **3\. Library of Correspondences: Natural Elements**

Natural elements form a foundational category in Swedenborg's system, often corresponding to the most fundamental aspects of spiritual life, Divine attributes, or states of the church and the human mind. The natural world, sustained by the heat and light of the natural sun, serves as a mirror reflecting the spiritual realities sustained by the heat (Love) and light (Wisdom) of the spiritual sun, which is the Lord's presence in heaven.

* **Sun:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The Lord Himself, specifically His Divine Love (as heat) and Divine Wisdom (as light). Also represents the ruling love in a person.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Self-love, love of the world dominating over love to the Lord; Divine Love obscured or rejected.  
  * **Explanation:** As the natural sun is the source of natural life, heat, and light, the spiritual sun (the Lord's presence) is the source of all spiritual life, love, and wisdom. Passages where the sun is darkened signify a state where love to the Lord has perished in the church or individual.  
* **Moon:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Faith derived from charity; intelligence; spiritual truth (reflecting the light/wisdom of the sun/love).  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Faith separated from charity; falsity; intelligence obscured or lost.  
  * **Explanation:** The moon reflects the sun's light, just as true faith and intelligence reflect the light of Divine Wisdom, which originates in Divine Love. When the moon does not give light, it signifies a loss of true faith.  
* **Stars:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Knowledges of good and truth derived from the Word; specific concepts and cognitions of spiritual realities. Angels or societies in heaven.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Falsities presented as knowledge; knowledges perverted or lost.  
  * **Explanation:** Stars provide points of light against the darkness, corresponding to specific knowledges that illuminate the mind regarding spiritual matters. Falling stars signify the loss or perversion of these knowledges within the church.  
* **Earth:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The Church, specifically the external church; the external or natural mind of a person; the general human race. The Lord's kingdom.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** The church devastated or lacking genuine good and truth; damnation; hell.  
  * **Explanation:** The earth is the foundation upon which life exists and grows, corresponding to the church as the foundation for spiritual life on the natural plane, or the natural mind as the basis for the spiritual mind. The state of the "earth" in spiritual visions reflects the state of the church or the spirits dwelling there.  
* **Water:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Truth, particularly natural truth; truths that cleanse and refresh the mind; knowledge; the literal sense of the Word.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Falsity; truth profaned or falsified.  
  * **Explanation:** Water cleanses the body and quenches thirst, corresponding to how truth cleanses the spirit from falsities and satisfies the mind's thirst for understanding. Different bodies of water (seas, rivers) represent different kinds or collections of truth.  
* **Fire:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Love, in both good and evil senses; Divine Love (celestial); spiritual love; affection.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Evil loves, such as self-love and love of the world; hatred; destructive passions; hellish love.  
  * **Explanation:** Fire provides warmth, corresponding to the warmth of love and affection in the spirit. Divine Love itself is described as a spiritual fire. Consuming fire often represents judgment on evils or the intensity of evil loves.  
* **Air (or Wind):**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The activity of the understanding; thought; perception; spiritual influence; influx of truth or falsity. Breath corresponds to life and consciousness.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Influx of falsity; foolish thoughts; spiritual devastation.  
  * **Explanation:** Air is necessary for breath and life, and is the medium for sound (speech/thought), corresponding to the life of thought and understanding. Winds represent spiritual influxes affecting thought; holding back the winds signifies moderating influx before judgment.  
* **Mountain:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Celestial love; love to the Lord; the highest or inmost state of the church or mind; heaven. The Lord Himself.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** The evil love of self; pride.  
  * **Explanation:** Mountains are elevated parts of the earth, corresponding to elevated states of love and perception. Worship was often performed on mountains, signifying elevation towards the Lord.  
* **Valley:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Lower or external things of the church or mind; humility; obscurity of truth. Those who desire instruction.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Low or base things; ignorance; state of damnation.  
  * **Explanation:** Valleys are lower than mountains, corresponding to less elevated spiritual states or the external aspects of the church and life. They can represent humility or states where truth is less clearly perceived.  
* **River:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Intelligence; wisdom; flowing truth derived from a higher source (like a mountain/love).  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Reasoning from falsities; false intelligence.  
  * **Explanation:** Rivers flow and provide water (truth) for the land (church/mind), corresponding to the flow of intelligence and wisdom that enriches spiritual life. The source and quality of the river indicate the nature of the intelligence.  
* **Sea:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Collections of truths in the natural mind; general knowledges (scientifica); the ultimate boundaries of the church or life; the external or literal sense of the Word.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Collections of falsities; worldly and corporeal things limiting the spiritual; hell.  
  * **Explanation:** Seas are vast collections of water (truth/knowledge) on the natural level. They represent the general store of natural knowledge or the outermost limits of spiritual understanding. Turbulent seas often represent states of temptation or influx of falsities.

**Table 1: Correspondences of Natural Elements**

| Element | Core Correspondence | Opposite Sense | Link to Love/Wisdom | Primary Source Examples |

| **Sea** | Natural Knowledges (Scientifica); General Truths; Literal Sense | Collection of Falsities; Worldliness; Hell | Boundary/Collection of natural-level Wisdom/Truth |  |

## **4\. Library of Correspondences: Living Creatures**

In Swedenborg's system, animals are not merely biological entities but correspond directly to the affections, feelings, thoughts, and principles within the human spirit (the mind or soul). The inherent nature and behavior of each animal reflect specific spiritual or psychological qualities. Good and useful animals generally correspond to good affections and true thoughts, while fierce, unclean, or poisonous animals correspond to evil affections, lusts, and false thoughts. Angelic conversations about specific affections can even manifest as corresponding animals in the spiritual world.  
Analysis of these correspondences reveals a distinct structure mirroring the levels of the human mind described by Swedenborg (natural, spiritual, celestial). For instance, gentle creatures like lambs and sheep are linked to the affections of the *spiritual* mind , whereas cattle relate to the affections of the *natural* mind. Similarly, birds like the eagle, capable of high flight and keen sight, correspond to rational thought and higher understanding , while creatures bound to the earth or water, like fish or serpents, relate to more external forms of knowledge or the lowest, sensual level of the mind. This demonstrates that the animal kingdom, in its vast diversity, serves as a corresponding image of the entire landscape of the human psyche, from its highest spiritual loves down to its most basic sensual inputs and reasonings.

* **Lion:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The power of truth, especially Divine Truth derived from the Word, in its strength and royalty; the Lord as to the power of Divine Truth.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** The power of falsity destroying truth; destructive evil; reasoning from falsity as if it were true.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** Power derived from truth (good sense) or falsity (bad sense).  
  * **Explanation:** The lion's strength corresponds to the power inherent in truth, particularly when combating falsities. The "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (Revelation 5:5) represents the Lord's omnipotence through His Divine Truth. In the vision of the Cherubim, the lion's face represents Divine Truth as to power. Conversely, the destructive nature of a lion can represent the devastating power of falsity derived from evil , or reasoning that appears powerful but is based on falsehood.  
* **Lamb:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Innocence, particularly the good of innocence; love to the Lord; the Lord Himself, especially His Divine Human and the good therein.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Innocence profaned or merely external/feigned.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** Affections of the spiritual mind; gentleness; trust.  
  * **Explanation:** Lambs embody gentleness and innocence, corresponding to the purest affections of the spiritual mind, particularly love towards the Lord. This is a central symbol for Jesus Christ ("Lamb of God") in the New Testament and especially Revelation, signifying His Divine Innocence and role in redemption. Sacrificial lambs represented purification through the Lord's innocence.  
* **Dove:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The goods and truths of faith; the affections of truth and good pertaining to the spiritual person; purification and regeneration. The Holy Spirit.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Falsified truths of faith.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** Affections related to spiritual truth and faith; a specific quality of innocence.  
  * **Explanation:** Doves correspond to the gentle affections associated with genuine faith and spiritual understanding. They were used in purification rituals. The "wings of a dove" signify the truths of faith enabling spiritual elevation. The dove appearing at Jesus' baptism represented the Holy Spirit, signifying purification and regeneration.  
* **Serpent:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The sensual degree of the mind; reasoning based on sensory input; the ultimate or lowest plane of natural life; prudence and circumspection (in a good sense).  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Evil reasoning based only on senses; deceit; poisonous falsities derived from evil loves; domination by bodily appetites; hellish influence.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** Sensual perception and reasoning; the lowest level of the natural mind.  
  * **Explanation:** Serpents live close to the ground, corresponding to the mind's lowest level, which engages directly with the physical world through the senses. This faculty is essential but becomes dangerous if it detaches from higher spiritual principles and trusts only external appearances, leading to deceit and falsity (as in the Genesis temptation narrative). "Wise as serpents" refers to necessary prudence in worldly matters. The bronze serpent lifted by Moses represented the Lord's Divine Sensual (His glorified ultimate nature), which has power to heal those who look to it from faith.  
* **Horse:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The understanding; the intellectual faculty, especially regarding the Word.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Understanding perverted by falsities; reasoning against truth; intellectual pride.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** The intellect; understanding.  
  * **Explanation:** Horses carry people, corresponding to how the understanding "carries" or processes thoughts, doctrines, and knowledge. The quality of the understanding is signified by the horse's color: white for a pure understanding of truth from the Word, red for understanding destroyed regarding good, black for understanding destroyed regarding truth, and pale for understanding destroyed regarding both. The "White Horse" of Revelation 19 signifies the understanding of the Word's spiritual sense being opened.  
* **Fish:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Knowledges (scientifica) belonging to the natural or external mind; memory-knowledge; natural truths; people characterized by such knowledge.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** Knowledges used for evil ends; falsities presented as facts.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** The natural memory and understanding; accumulation of external facts.  
  * **Explanation:** Fish dwell in water (natural truth/knowledge), thus representing the contents of the natural mind's memory and external understanding. "Fishers of men" signifies instructing those who are in natural states of knowledge and bringing them to spiritual truths.  
* **Eagle:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Rational thought; intelligence; knowledge and understanding; perception from a high vantage point.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** False reasoning; rationality confirming falsities; intellectual pride.  
  * **Related Faculty/Affection:** The rational faculty; intellectual perception.  
  * **Explanation:** The eagle's high flight and keen vision correspond to the rational mind's ability to survey truths broadly and perceive them acutely. It represents a higher intellectual capacity than the merely natural. In the Cherubim vision, the eagle's face represents Divine Truth as to knowledge and understanding. In a negative sense, eagles gathering at a carcass can represent rationalizations used to justify dead or false doctrines.

**Table 2: Correspondences of Living Creatures**

| Creature | Core Correspondence | Opposite Sense | Related Faculty/Affection | Primary Source Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Lion** | Power of Truth; Divine Truth in Power | Power of Falsity; Destructive Evil | Power (from Truth or Falsity) |  |
| **Lamb** | Innocence; Good of Innocence; Love to Lord; The Lord | Profaned/Feigned Innocence | Spiritual Affections; Gentleness |  |
| **Dove** | Goods & Truths of Faith; Spiritual Affections; Holy Spirit | Falsified Faith | Spiritual Affections; Faith |  |
| **Serpent** | Sensual Degree of Mind; Reasoning from Senses; Prudence | Evil Sensual Reasoning; Deceit; Poisonous Falsities | Sensual Perception & Reasoning (Lowest Mind) |  |
| **Horse** | Understanding; Intellectual Faculty (esp. re: the Word) | Perverted Understanding; False Reasoning | Intellect; Understanding |  |
| **Fish** | Natural Knowledges (Scientifica); Memory-Knowledge; Natural Truth | Knowledges used for Evil; Falsities as Facts | Natural Memory & Understanding |  |
| **Eagle** | Rational Thought; Intelligence; Knowledge; Higher Perception | False Reasoning; Rationality confirming Falsity | Rational Faculty; Intellectual Perception |  |

## **5\. Library of Correspondences: Plants and Trees**

Plants and trees, in Swedenborg's system, generally correspond to aspects of human intelligence, wisdom, perception, and knowledge, particularly those related to spiritual life and the church. Gardens signify states of intelligence and wisdom, hence heaven is called the "Garden of God". The type of plant or tree often indicates the *quality* or *level* of the corresponding mental faculty or spiritual principle. Fruits correspond to the goods of life, or good works resulting from love and faith, while leaves often relate to truths that clothe good. Grains like wheat correspond to the essential goods that nourish the spirit.  
A significant pattern emerges in the correspondences of the Olive, Vine, and Fig tree. These three trees represent distinct levels or aspects of the church, mirroring Swedenborg's understanding of the celestial (love-based), spiritual (truth/faith-based), and external/natural planes of reality and the human mind. The Olive tree corresponds to the highest, celestial church, rooted in love to the Lord. The Vine corresponds to the spiritual church, characterized by charity towards the neighbor and faith in truth. The Fig tree corresponds to the external manifestation of both celestial and spiritual good in the natural life, representing natural goodness and practical kindness derived from internal principles. This structure shows that the symbolism is not random but reflects the fundamental order Swedenborg perceived in spiritual reality.

* **Olive Tree:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The celestial church; the good of celestial love (love directed primarily to the Lord); internal good.  
  * **Related Church/Mind Aspect:** Celestial Kingdom/Church; the highest state of love and good in the will.  
  * **Explanation:** Represents the highest form of spiritual life, characterized by love for the Lord above all else. Oil from the olive signifies this celestial good and the delight associated with it. Its presence signifies a connection with the inmost heaven.  
* **Vine:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The spiritual church; the good of spiritual love (charity toward the neighbor); the truth of faith.  
  * **Related Church/Mind Aspect:** Spiritual Kingdom/Church; faith, truth in the understanding, and charity towards others.  
  * **Explanation:** Represents the church and individual focused on understanding truth and living in charity. Wine from the vine signifies spiritual truth or the good derived from faith and charity. The Lord as the Vine signifies He is the source of all spiritual truth.  
* **Fig Tree:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** The external good of the celestial and spiritual church; natural good derived from internal principles; good works in the natural life.  
  * **Related Church/Mind Aspect:** External church; natural level of good; practical application of spiritual principles.  
  * **Explanation:** Represents the outward expression of inner love and faith in the form of natural kindness, morality, and useful actions. Sitting under one's fig tree symbolizes the peace and security derived from living a life of natural good rooted in spiritual principles. A fig tree with leaves but no fruit represents faith or knowledge without corresponding good works.  
* **Cedar:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Spiritual truth; the rational aspect of the mind; intellectual truth. (Based on general correspondence of trees and Cedar's noble nature).  
  * **Related Church/Mind Aspect:** Rational faculty; intellectual understanding of spiritual things.  
  * **Explanation:** As tall, enduring trees, cedars often represent the rational faculty and the perception of spiritual truth from a more intellectual standpoint. While Swedenborg sometimes linked shittim wood (used in the Tabernacle) to cedar via a contemporary source, he consistently interpreted shittim wood itself as signifying the Lord's merit. The primary correspondence of Cedar relates to the strength and elevation of rational, spiritual thought.  
* **Wheat:**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Celestial good; the good of love and charity; the primary nourishment for the soul.  
  * **Related Church/Mind Aspect:** Celestial good; love in the will; nourishment of the spirit.  
  * **Explanation:** Wheat is the source of bread, the staple food. It corresponds to the highest form of good—celestial love—which is the essential nourishment for the human spirit. Represents the goods received directly from the Lord into the will.  
* **Tares (Zizania):**  
  * **Core Correspondence:** Falsities derived from evil; evils manifesting as false thoughts. (Inferred from the Parable of Wheat and Tares, Matt 13, and general principles, as specific definition snippets are lacking ).  
  * **Related Church/Mind Aspect:** Falsity originating from evil; contamination within the church/mind.  
  * **Explanation:** In the parable, tares are sown by the enemy (devil) among the good seed (wheat) sown by the Son of Man. They represent the evils and resulting falsities that infiltrate the church and the individual mind, existing alongside truths and goods until the time of judgment ("harvest") when separation occurs. They are the direct opposite of the good and truth signified by wheat.

**Table 3: Correspondences of Plants and Trees**

| Plant/Tree | Core Correspondence | Related Church/Mind Aspect | Primary Source Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Olive Tree** | Celestial Church; Good of Celestial Love (to Lord) | Celestial Church/Kingdom; Inmost Good |  |
| **Vine** | Spiritual Church; Good of Charity (Neighbor); Truth of Faith | Spiritual Church/Kingdom; Faith & Charity |  |
| **Fig Tree** | External Good (from Celestial/Spiritual); Natural Good | External Church; Natural Good; Good Works |  |
| **Cedar** | Spiritual Truth; Rational Mind; Intellectual Truth | Rational Faculty; Intellectual Perception | (General Tree) |
| **Wheat** | Celestial Good; Good of Love & Charity; Soul's Nourishment | Celestial Good; Love in the Will |  |
| **Tares** | Falsities from Evil; Evils as False Thoughts | Falsity from Evil; Contamination in Mind/Church | (Inferred from Parable) |

## **6\. Library of Correspondences: Objects and Materials**

Objects and materials mentioned in the Bible also carry specific spiritual meanings according to Swedenborg's system. Metals often form a hierarchy corresponding to descending levels of good and truth, reflecting a perceived decline in the spiritual state of humanity or the church over time. Ritual objects used in worship, such as the Temple, Ark, and Altar, correspond profoundly to the Lord, aspects of heaven and the church, the nature of worship, and the conjunction between the Divine and the human. Basic substances like bread, wine, and oil correspond to the essential elements of spiritual life: good, truth, and love.  
The hierarchy observed in the metals—Gold (celestial good), Silver (spiritual truth), Brass (natural good), Iron (natural truth)—is explicitly linked by Swedenborg to the ancient concept of the Golden, Silver, Copper (Brass), and Iron Ages. He interprets these "Ages" not just as mythical periods but as representative of successive states of the church, tracing a decline from the highest state of love (Golden Age, Most Ancient Church) down to a state characterized by external or literal truth devoid of internal good (Iron Age). Nebuchadnezzar's dream statue with its head of gold, chest of silver, belly of brass, and legs of iron is presented as a direct representation of this spiritual decline. This connection imbues the correspondences of metals with a dynamic historical and spiritual dimension.  
Furthermore, the correspondences of ritual objects like the Ark, Altar, and Temple are not merely symbolic *of* worship, but reveal the inner *nature* of true worship and the spiritual realities involved. The Israelite church's external rituals were designed to be representative of internal spiritual processes and the connection with the Divine. Thus, the Ark containing the Law signifies the Lord's presence through Divine Truth and the covenant of conjunction ; the Altar represents the reception of Divine Love and the act of worship from the heart ; and the Temple represents the Lord's Divine Human as the ultimate dwelling place of God, as well as the church and the regenerated individual built from Divine truths and goods. Understanding these correspondences illuminates the spiritual meaning embedded within the Bible's descriptions of worship.

  * **Precious Stones (Gems/Crystals):** In general, precious stones correspond to the truths of the Word in its literal sense, made transparent and radiant by the spiritual sense within, revealing Divine Love and Wisdom. They represent holy truths derived from good. The appearance of precious stones in heaven corresponds to the intelligence and wisdom of the angels there. The foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem being garnished with precious stones signifies that the doctrine of the New Church is founded upon truths shining from the spiritual sense of the Word. Specific precious stones correspond to particular qualities of truth derived from good :  
    * **Ruby (also Sardius, Carbuncle):** Fiery stones corresponding to celestial good, or truths glowing with Divine Love.

## **7\. Conclusion**

Emanuel Swedenborg's doctrine of correspondences presents a systematic and deeply integrated vision of reality, wherein the natural world and the literal text of the Bible serve as direct reflections and ultimate expressions of spiritual and divine realities. This system posits that every natural element, creature, plant, and object possesses an inherent spiritual significance, derived from its function and quality within the created order, ultimately stemming from the Divine Love and Wisdom that constitute God. Understanding these correspondences, according to Swedenborg, is the essential key to unlocking the Bible's profound inner meaning, which details the path of spiritual regeneration and the nature of the Lord's kingdom.  
This report has compiled a foundational library of these correspondences, focusing specifically on natural elements, living creatures, plants/trees, and common objects/materials frequently encountered in scripture, as requested. The meanings presented are drawn from Swedenborg's theological works (primarily *Arcana Coelestia*, *Apocalypse Explained*, and *Apocalypse Revealed*) and authoritative compilations like the *Dictionary of Correspondences*, adhering strictly to the inherent symbolism attributed by Swedenborg. The analysis reveals consistent patterns within the system, such as the hierarchical relationship between symbols reflecting the discrete degrees of reality (celestial, spiritual, natural) and the human mind, and the association of metals with successive states of the church.  
The implication of Swedenborg's system is vast: it suggests that both the Word and the world are imbued with layers of spiritual meaning, accessible through rational inquiry guided by revealed principles. For Swedenborg, this understanding is not merely intellectual but transformative, offering a way to perceive the Divine operating within all aspects of creation and human experience, thereby facilitating conjunction with the Lord and progress towards a heavenly life.  
For those seeking deeper exploration of this complex system, several avenues are recommended:

1. **Primary Sources:** Direct engagement with Swedenborg's major theological works, such as *Arcana Coelestia*, *Apocalypse Explained*, *Apocalypse Revealed*, and *Heaven and Hell*, offers the most comprehensive understanding.  
2. **Reference Works:** Consulting resources like George Nicholson's *Dictionary of Correspondences* or *Swedenborg Concordances* can provide quick access to specific symbol definitions.  
3. **Online Databases:** Utilizing searchable online platforms dedicated to Swedenborg's writings, such as eswedenborg.com, New Christian Bible Study, the Swedenborg Foundation website, and the Swedenborg Digital Library, allows for targeted research across his voluminous output.  
4. **Scholarly Analysis:** Exploring academic studies on Swedenborg's theology, hermeneutics, and influence provides critical perspectives and contextual understanding.

By engaging with these resources, one can further investigate the intricate web of meaning Swedenborg perceived woven through the fabric of scripture and existence itself.
