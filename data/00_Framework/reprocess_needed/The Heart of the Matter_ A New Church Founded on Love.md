# **The Heart of the Matter: A New Church Founded on Love**

## **Part I: The "Suffocation" and the Promise of a New Morning**

This exploration delves into the theological entity known as the "Fourth Church," or the New Jerusalem.1 Its existence is a direct spiritual answer to the "suffocation" and "darkness" characteristic of a consummated age.

This New Church is not just a new institution, but a new era of spiritual life. Its establishment was made possible only by the "consummation," or the definitive end, of the former Christian Church.1 That preceding church had reached a terminal state described as "evening and nighttime"—a spiritual condition where the "longing for good," genuine faith, and true, loving charity had been lost.1

The prophecies in the book of Revelation about "a new heaven and a new earth" (Revelation 21:1) are not about the physical world ending. That literal interpretation is rejected. Instead, they describe the establishment of a new *internal* world (a "new heaven") and a new *external* world (a "new earth"), which together mean a new church for humanity.1 This new establishment, a new church in heaven and on earth, is necessary because the Word, divine worship, and sermons exist in heaven just as on earth, albeit in a more perfected, spiritual state.1

The great turning point was a spiritual event, not a physical one, called the Last Judgment. This was not a future event, but one that has already been accomplished. It was executed in the spiritual world in 1757\.1 This judgment was not a universal event for all of history, but was carried out specifically on those who had lived from the Lord’s time to the present day, comprising all the peoples of the former Christian Church (both Catholic and Protestant), as well as Muslims and other groups.1 The "first heaven and the first earth" that "passed away" (Revelation 21:1) refer to this "heaven" gathered from the beginning of the Christian church, which was comprised of spirits who were not yet angels and whose spiritual state had become vastated, necessitating its removal.1

This metaphysical event—the Last Judgment of 1757—is what *makes the New Church possible*. It restored spiritual equilibrium and, most importantly, reopened a full and direct communication between heaven and earth, allowing the "light" to shine through again.1

This leads to a simple, beautiful re-understanding of "the coming of the Lord." This "coming" is not a physical return, but the *revelation of the internal sense of the Word*.1 It is the "light" of new understanding. The internal meaning of Revelation, which had been hidden, is now revealed specifically to assist in the establishment of this New Church.1 Because this revelation of the internal sense *is* the very means by which the New Church exists, the "coming of the Lord" is understood to have already taken place.1

This New Church is not established instantly. It begins "at first be among a few, and... successively increase among many".1 This gradual process is necessary because the false ideas of the former church—the "thorns" that cause the "suffocation"—must first be seen, understood, and removed.1

### **Section 1.2: The Simple, Foundational Truth: Love is Everything**

The New Church is defined by a simple, profound truth that was lost and "covered up" by the former church. The "why" of this New Church is to restore this truth.

It is founded on two core, inseparable essentials that constitute the *entirety* of this new way of living:

1. **Acknowledging the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth** (the source of all love and truth).1  
2. **A life according to the precepts of the Decalogue** (living that love by turning from evil and doing good, which is repentance).1

This new foundation is the *direct answer* to the doctrine that caused the "suffocation": the doctrine of **"faith alone"** (Sola Fide). This doctrine is explicitly identified as the very thing that **"destroyed the Third Church"**.1 It was the "how" of the suffocation—a teaching that separated belief from action.

The New Church, therefore, must emphatically reject this. It is, instead, a **"Church of Charity and Life"**.1 It redefines faith into something simple, grounded, and real: faith is "to will and to put into practice what we believe".1 Salvation is not for those who just *believe* (the "faith alone" of the "learned"), but for those who "live according to the commandments... and consequently possess truths from good".1 These are the people—the "open" hearts—who constitute the New Jerusalem.

These "two essentials" are not a list; they are a *conjoined life*. They are the inseparable whole that the former church broke. Acknowledging the Lord (Essential 1\) is the source of power. Living a life of love (Essential 2\) is the *only* way that acknowledgment becomes real. This new spiritual foundation creates an unbreakable bond between what one *believes* and how one *lives*, replacing the "faith alone" doctrine that had caused the spiritual "nighttime" of the prior age.1

## **Part II: The Prophetic Story of How Love Was Lost (and Found)**

To understand this "suffocation," the book of Daniel provides a prophetic vision: the statue of a man. This statue is not about political kingdoms; it is the *spiritual story of the church on Earth*, mapping its decline from a "golden" heart to a "clay" foundation.1

### **Section 2.1: The Statue: The Story of a Heart's Decline**

The vision of the statue (Daniel 2\) describes the "successive states of the church".1 Crucially, the sources emphasize that all previous churches are "intrinsically linked to each other" because the statue is described as "a man".1 This represents a single, continuous spiritual body, whose life (its "longing") diminishes as it descends from the head to the feet. This progression maps the church's spiritual "life" as it moves from its inmost "longing" (love) down to its most external, lifeless state (empty ritual).1

This spiritual degradation is detailed through the correspondence of the four materials of the statue 1:

* **Head (Gold):** This represents the **Most Ancient Church**, the Celestial Church. This was the "golden age," the first and noblest state, in which the "good of love to the Lord reigned".1 It was a state of direct, intuitive connection to the Divine—a pure, simple "longing."  
* **Breast/Arms (Silver):** This represents the **Ancient Church**, or Spiritual Church. Here, the guiding principle was "truths from that good," or what we call charity.1 This was a step removed from the direct "longing" of the golden age, a life guided by truths *about* love.  
* **Belly/Thighs (Brass):** This signifies the **third succeeding church** (including the Israelitish church). This state is **Spiritual-Natural**, where the "good of faith and the truth from that good reigned".1 This represents a further "externalizing" of spiritual life, a life of obedience.  
* **Legs/Feet (Iron/Clay):** This final part represents the **Christian Church** (the Third Church) and its "suffocated," "vastated" (desolated) state.1 This is the "consummation" of the entire sequence, representing an **"external church without any internal"**.1 The symbolism here is precise, and it perfectly describes "scholarly blindness":  
  * **Iron (Iron):** This corresponds to natural truth, specifically the truth of the Word in its literal sense.1  
  * **Clay (Clay):** This corresponds to falsity, specifically **"falsity from self-intelligence"**.1

The final state of the Christian Church is this "suffocating" mixture of iron and clay. It *had* the Word (the "iron"), but it destroyed its life by mixing it with the "clay" of human "self-intelligence." This "falsity from self-intelligence" *is* the "faith alone" doctrine and the "pride" 1 that confirms it. It is what takes the living truths of the Word and *perverts* them, creating an "external church without any internal" 1—a world of external knowledge devoid of internal love.

This entire progression, from the "gold" of pure love to the "clay" of proud, loveless "self-intelligence," illustrates the complete decay of the church's spiritual heart.1

**Table: The Four Successive States of the Church (The Decline of Love)**

| Prophetic Symbol (Metal) | Church Name (Internal Sense) | Spiritual Principle (The Heart's State) | State of Reception (Internal/External) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Head of Gold** | Most Ancient Church | Celestial | "Good of love to the Lord" (Inmost "Longing") 1 |
| **Breast/Arms of Silver** | Ancient Church | Spiritual | "Truths from that good" (Internal/Charity) |
| **Belly/Thighs of Brass** | Third Succeeding Church | Spiritual-Natural | "Good of faith" (External/Obedience) |
| **Legs/Feet of Iron & Clay** | Christian Church (Vastated) | Natural | "External church without any internal" (Truth mixed with "falsity from self-intelligence") (Ultimate "Suffocation") 1 |

### **Section 2.2: The Shattering Stone: The Power of Simple, Pure Truth**

Into this scene of total spiritual "suffocation," a new element is introduced: the "stone cut out of the rock" (Daniel 2:34-35).1 This stone is the very symbol of this spiritual liberation.

The "stone" signifies the Lord, specifically the Lord "by means of Divine truth".1 The Lord is called the "stone of Israel," and the stone is explicitly identified as the "Divine truth upon which heaven and the church are founded." This stone, therefore, signifies the Lord in His Divine Human, the source of all Divine truth.1

Crucially, the stone is *not* just the next part of the statue. The statue represents the *human reception* of the Divine, which is fallible and decays over time.1 The stone, "cut out of the rock" (not made by human hands), represents **pure Divine Truth itself**, revealed directly by the Lord.1 Its appearance signifies the end of churches based on human "self-intelligence" (the statue), and the beginning of a church based on the *internal truth itself* (the stone).

The action of the stone—"smiting and shattering the image"—is a direct symbolic representation of the Last Judgment.1 The "shattering" is the *breaking* of the "falsified external notions" and "dire persuasions of falsity" that constituted the former church.1 It is the "true inner truth of the Word" (the stone) shattering "all external notions" (the statue).1 This judgment is necessary because all the ideas linked to the previous churches are, in themselves, "fallible" and lead to an "incorrect interpretation of actual truth" when their internal life—their "longing"—is lost.1

This reveals a profound, unified spiritual event, described by three different symbolic expressions:

1. **The Stone** (Divine Truth revealed) *is* 1  
2. **The "Coming of the Lord"** (The revelation of the Word's internal sense) which *causes* 1  
3. **The Last Judgment** (The "shattering" of the old, false, "clay" structures) which *enables* 1  
4. **The New Jerusalem** (The "great rock" that forms a new, permanent foundation).

The stone "rolling," signifying a "gradual revealment," aligns with the gradual establishment of the New Church.1 Its final state, becoming a "great rock and filling the whole earth," signifies that the Lord, by means of this revealed Divine truth, is to rule over a new, universal, and enduring heaven and church.1 This New Church is thus "not bounded to the flow of churches as before but standing on its own grounded in the full truth of the Lord".1

## **Part III: The "Open" Heart vs. The "Closed" Heart**

This leads to a profound question: Why are some receptive to this truth while many others, seemingly "so ignorant," are not?

This framework answers this, not with "scholarly" language, but with a deep, spiritual-psychological truth. It redefines the very "who" and "how" of the church.

### **Section 3.1: The "Open" Heart (The "Gentiles")**

The documents state that the angels express "only slight hope for people of the Christian church" but "more hope for a particular group of people distant from the Christian world".1 This leads to the statement that the New Church is established with the "Gentiles".1

This is where the "simple" truth is so important. This is *not* about a physical location or a non-Christian religion. "Gentiles" or "nations" is a *spiritual term* for an *internal state of the heart*.1

* "Nations" (or Gentiles) means "those who are in the **good of love**... and in an abstract sense goods." They are "all who are in the **good of life**, and believe in the Lord".1  
* They are "people of all religions" who possess an **"affection for truth, but who are not in truths yet"**.1 This is the very "deep profound longing" that defines this internal state.

The *reason* the New Church is established with those in this "Gentile" state is the key. They are receptive because "they have **no principles of falsity contrary to the truths of faith**, for they are ignorant of these truths".1

This "ignorance" is, in fact, a *spiritual protection*.

Because those with this "open" heart are "ignorant" of the *confirmed* false doctrines (or have intuitively *rejected* them), "they cannot by evils of life profane holy things, because no one can profane what is holy who knows not what it is".1 Unlike the "learned" Christian who has "known" the truth and mixed it with "clay," the "Gentile" heart has "not closed the internal man in themselves by negations of truth." Therefore, their "internal is readily opened and receptive of truth".1

This redefines the "church" itself. The Lord’s church is universal, existing "throughout the whole world with all people who live in good according to their religions and acknowledge something Divine".1 The New Jerusalem is simply the *gathering and illumination* of these "open hearts"—this universal body of the "good"—with the new, genuine Divine Truth that *matches* their "longing."

### **Section 3.2: The "Closed" Heart (The "Learned")**

In stark contrast to the "open" heart stands the "learned" class of the former Christian church. This is the "everyone around me" of a consummated age. This group is defined by the very "knowledge" that makes them, paradoxically, *incapable* of receiving new truths.1

This is the state of **"scholarly blindness"**.1

* Those in the former church "perceive themselves as being rich with knowledge and truth".1  
* They are in the "pride of **self-intelligence** (*proprium*) and **love of self**," a state that "**closes... their deeper levels**" and causes their "intellectual faculty" to be "**covered up and blotted out** by the evils of one's own love".1  
* This is the "how" of the "suffocation." Having developed only their "skill in argumentation—the ability to prove anything they please," their intellect is no longer a tool for *perceiving* truth but a *weapon* for *defending* their pre-existing false principles. They "see falsities rather than true ones".1  
* They are the "rich" for whom it is impossible to pass through the "eye of the needle," because they "reject everything that strips them of this knowledge".1 Many of the learned who deny the Divine are "atheists at heart" and "more insane in spiritual matters than simple people".1

This intellectual pride is *inseparable* from the "faith alone" doctrine. That doctrine *is* the "self-intelligence" of the "clay" in its theological form. It allows an individual to *believe* they are "rich and increased in goods" (an intellectual act) while remaining spiritually "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" (a life without love).1

This dynamic *is* the answer to this question. The New Church is rejected by those whose internal is "closed" by the intellectual pride of "faith alone," and it is *instantly recognized* and accepted by the "Gentiles" (the "simple-minded" and "well-disposed" 1), whose internal is "open" because they are "in the good of life" and have always had that "longing" for truth.1

## **Part IV: The New Prophecies: Love is the Foundation**

The doctrines of the New Church are not just written in books; they are written in the very symbols of the Word. These symbols provide the final, beautiful confirmation that "this message about love is all that matters."

### **Section 4.1: Zion, the Mountain of Love**

The Apocalypse (Chapter 14\) describes a vision of "a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty-four thousand".2 The internal meaning of this image *is* the new church:

* **The Lamb:** This signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human.2  
* **Mount Zion:** "Mount Zion" signifies heaven and the church. But *specifically*, it is "where they are who are in **love to the Lord**." A "mountain" signifies love, and "Zion" signifies the "church as to **love**".2  
* **Jerusalem:** In distinction, "Jerusalem" (which, in Chapter 21, "descends" from this new heaven) signifies the "church as to **doctrine**" or doctrine *from* that love.1  
* **The 144,000:** This is not a literal number, but a spiritual *quality*. It signifies "all who acknowledge the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth" (Essential 1\) and who are "in the truths of doctrine from the **good of love**" (Essential 2).2

This single image is the *visual antidote* to the "faith alone" doctrine. The New Church is not just "Jerusalem" (doctrine) floating alone. It is "Jerusalem" *descending* from a heaven *founded on* "Mount Zion" (love). The people of this church (the "144,000") are not those in faith *alone*, but those who are in "truths *from* the good of love." These symbols are the very picture of the "two essentials" conjoined as one.

### **Section 4.2: The Lord's Final Command: Love is the Home of the Church**

The most profound and emotionally deep mandate for the New Church is found in the Lord's words from the cross (John 19:26-27).4 This scene is a divine allegory for the very moment the old church "ended."

* **The Disciple John:** The disciple John, who "lay on the breast... of the Lord" and was loved above the others, represents the **"good of love"** or the **"good of charity"**.4 It is because John represented this essential good—the "longing" which *is* the church—that he was so loved.4  
* **The Mother (Mary):** The Lord's "mother," Mary, to whom he first says "Woman," signifies *the church*.4

In this most ultimate moment of the old church's consummation, the Lord (Divine Truth itself) performs a final, critical act. He says to his "mother" (the Church), "Woman, behold thy son" (John, the good of charity). And he says to the disciple (the good of charity), "Behold thy mother" (the Church).

The text then states, "And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home".4

The internal, simple, and profound meaning of this act *is* the charter of the New Jerusalem. It signifies that **"the church will be where the good of charity is"** and that these two—the church (as doctrine) and the good of charity (as a life of love)—"should **dwell together**".4

At the moment of its end, the church is entrusted *by the Lord Himself* to the "good of love." This is the prophetic decree that any *true* church can *only* be one where faith (the Church/Mary) and charity (John) are inseparably "at home" together.

## **Part V: Conclusion: The Restoration of Love**

The "Fourth Church" is not a new building, but a *new spiritual paradigm* for humanity.1

This paradigm was initiated by a definitive, causal event: the Last Judgment, executed in the spiritual world in 1757\.1 This judgment was the *shattering* (prefigured by the "stone" of Daniel's prophecy) 1 of the "external notions" and "dire persuasions of falsity" that had defined the "suffocated" Christian Church (the "statue" of iron and clay).1

The New Church is defined by its shift from an *external* church, based on the *literal sense* of the Word perverted by *self-intelligence* ("clay"), to an *internal* church, based on the *spiritual sense* of the Word, which is Divine Truth itself ("the stone").1 This new dispensation *is* the "coming of the Lord".1

Its "two essentials"—the acknowledgment of the Lord and a life of love 1—are the spiritual and practical *antidote* to the "faith alone" doctrine that consummated the prior age.1 All the core symbols of the New Church, including "Mount Zion" (love) 2, "Jerusalem" (doctrine from love) 3, the "144,000" (the conjunction of truth and good) 2, and the entrusting of the "church" (Mary) to "charity" (John) 4, reinforce this new, inseparable conjunction.

Finally, the establishment of this church is gradual ("at first be among a few") 1 and its reception is determined by the *state of the heart*, not external affiliations. It is rejected by the "learned" who are in the "pride of self-intelligence" and "scholarly blindness"—a "closed" state created and defended by the "faith alone" doctrine.1

It is, and always will be, received by the "Gentiles" or "nations"—a *universal internal state* signifying all those "in the good of love" and "good of life," "people of all religions" 1 whose internals are "open" 1 and who have always had that simple, profound, and "intrinsic feeling": a "longing for good" that is now, finally, "breaking free."
