# **The Apple and the Angel: An Exhaustive Investigation into the Erasure, Translation, and Persistence of Swedenborgian Theology in Walt Disney’s *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed***

## **I. Introduction: The Cartography of a Cultural Palimpsest**

In the vast archive of American folklore, few figures occupy a space as paradoxical and contested as John Chapman, the itinerant nurseryman known to history and myth as Johnny Appleseed. To the secular historian, Chapman is a shrewd land speculator and eccentric horticulturalist who navigated the complex economic landscape of the expanding Northwest Territory. To the theologian, specifically within the Church of the New Jerusalem, he is the American St. Francis, a barefoot ascetic and zealous missionary who distributed the esoteric revelations of the 18th-century Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg along with his apple seeds. Yet, to the collective consciousness of the American public, he is almost exclusively the figure codified by Walt Disney Productions in the 1948 animated segment *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed*, a component of the package film *Melody Time*.  
The Disney iteration of Chapman—a scrawny, pot-wearing, hymn-singing wanderer accompanied by a "private guardian angel"—is a masterpiece of mid-century animation, defined by the modernist folk aesthetic of Mary Blair and the earnest vocal performance of Dennis Day. However, for scholars of religious history and cinema, this film presents a significant problem of representation. The historical Chapman was defined by his specific sectarian allegiance; he did not merely carry "a book," but distinct, heavy volumes of Swedenborgian theology, which he tore into chapters to circulate among pioneers as "news right fresh from heaven." The Disney film, by contrast, depicts Johnny carrying a single, black-bound volume, visually coded as a standard King James Bible, with no mention of the New Church or its distinct doctrines.  
This perceived sanitization has given rise to a persistent critical claim: that Disney’s *Johnny Appleseed* represents a total erasure of the character’s Swedenborgian identity in favor of a "generic," non-denominational Protestantism suitable for a mass market. This report undertakes a rigorous, forensic investigation into that claim. By triangulating archival production records, the biographical backgrounds of the creative team, the regulatory environment of post-war Hollywood (specifically the Hays Code), and the theological structure of the film’s narrative, this inquiry seeks to determine whether this erasure was an act of ignorance or a calculated strategic maneuver.  
The investigation reveals a complex reality. The substitution of Swedenborgian tracts with a generic Bible was undeniably a strategic choice, driven by the commercial necessity of the "package film" era and the rigid constraints of the Motion Picture Production Code. However, deeper analysis suggests that while the *label* of Swedenborgianism was excised, the *structure* of the theology was preserved and even canonized. Through the guidance of folklore consultant Carl Carmer—who was intimately familiar with Chapman’s true faith—and the oversight of a culturally literate story team, Disney created a film that functions as a covert theological text. From the depiction of the afterlife as a "Kingdom of Uses" to the specific characterization of the guardian angel as a deceased human spirit, the film retains a high fidelity to Swedenborgian doctrine, translated into the vernacular of American tall tales. Furthermore, the 1974 confirmation of the film’s art director, Mary Blair, into the Swedenborgian Church suggests a profound, perhaps lifelong, engagement with these spiritual concepts that permeated the visual fabric of the film.

## **II. The Historical Reality: John Chapman as Missionary of the New Jerusalem**

To understand the magnitude of the adaptation and the specific nature of the "erasure," one must first establish the theological reality of the historical John Chapman. He was not a vague pantheist or a simple nature-lover; he was a distinct theological agent operating within a specific, often controversial, religious framework.

### **2.1 The Theology of Emanuel Swedenborg**

The intellectual architecture of Chapman’s life was provided by Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), a Swedish scientist-turned-mystic who claimed to have received a direct revelation from the Lord, allowing him to travel freely between heaven, hell, and the world of spirits. The "New Church" (or Church of the New Jerusalem), founded on his writings, proposed a radical restructuring of Christian thought that diverged sharply from the Calvinist and Evangelical orthodoxy of the American frontier.  
Key tenets of Swedenborgianism that are relevant to the Chapman mythos include:

* **The Doctrine of Correspondences:** Swedenborg argued that the natural world is a causal mirror of the spiritual world. Every physical object is the "ultimate" form of a spiritual truth. An apple is not just a fruit; it corresponds to "wisdom" or the "good of life" derived from truth. A seed corresponds to the "Word" or potentiality. This worldview imbued Chapman’s horticulture with sacramental weight.  
* **The Maxim of Use:** Salvation is not achieved by *sola fide* (faith alone), but by the conjunction of Charity (Love) and Faith in the performance of "uses" (good works). Swedenborg wrote, "The kingdom of heaven is a kingdom of uses." The spiritual value of a man is determined by his utility to his neighbor.  
* **Eschatology and Angelology:** Swedenborg rejected the idea of angels as a separate species created before humanity. He taught that all angels and demons are the spirits of deceased human beings. Death is merely a continuation of life in a spiritual body, where the individual continues to pursue their "ruling love." If a man loved usefulness on earth, he would practice usefulness in heaven.  
* **The Nature of Scripture:** Swedenborg believed the Bible contained an internal spiritual sense, which his writings unlocked.

### **2.2 Chapman’s Evangelism: The Tracts**

Chapman’s method of evangelism was inextricably linked to his nursery business. He operated as a "colporteur," a distributor of religious literature. The volumes of Swedenborg—such as *Arcana Coelestia* and *Heaven and Hell*—were expensive and physically heavy. To maximize their reach, Chapman would separate the books into chapters or "tracts," distributing them to cabins along the frontier. On subsequent visits, he would rotate the chapters, creating a primitive lending library system. He famously referred to this literature not as "sermons" but as "news right fresh from heaven".  
Historical accounts confirm that Chapman was a zealous advocate for these specific doctrines. He refused to harm animals (even mosquitoes or rattlesnakes) because he viewed them as correspondences of human affections and part of the divine order. He believed his celibacy on earth would be rewarded with "two wives" in the spiritual world (a folk interpretation of Swedenborg’s doctrine of Conjugial Love).

### **2.3 The Discrepancy**

The Disney film depicts Johnny carrying a single, black-bound book with gold tooling, visually indistinguishable from a standard King James Bible. The narrator refers to it as "The Book" or "The Good Book." There are no loose tracts, no mentions of Swedenborg, and no exposition on the internal sense of scripture. This substitution—the replacement of a specific, controversial sectarian library with a universal symbol of Protestant piety—is the central act of erasure under investigation.

## **III. The Production Context: *Melody Time* and Post-War Hollywood**

The production of *Melody Time* (1948) occurred during a specific window of constraint and transition for Walt Disney Productions. Understanding this context is crucial to determining whether the erasure of Swedenborg was an act of ignorance or strategy.

### **3.1 The Package Film Era and Economic Constraint**

Following World War II, the studio was in a precarious financial position. The European market had been closed during the war, and expensive features like *Fantasia* and *Bambi* had failed to recoup their costs. To maintain a theatrical presence without the expense of a full narrative feature, Disney produced "package films"—anthologies of short animated segments set to music. *Melody Time* was the last of these (before the partial return to form with *Ichabod and Mr. Toad*).  
The package format demanded narrative economy. The "Johnny Appleseed" segment runs approximately 19 minutes. In this compressed format, complex exposition regarding 18th-century Swedish mysticism would have been narrative poison. The filmmakers needed visual shorthand. A "Bible" reads instantly as "faith"; a stack of Swedenborgian tracts requires explanation.

### **3.2 The Hays Code and Religious Representation**

In 1948, the Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code) was the dominant regulatory force in Hollywood. While the Code did not explicitly ban the depiction of specific religions, it contained strict clauses regarding religion:

* **Clause VIII:** "No film or episode may throw ridicule on any religious faith."  
* **General Principles:** The sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, or *evil*.  
* **The Controversy Clause:** Studios generally avoided depicting "cults" or non-mainstream sects to avoid alienating the powerful Catholic Legion of Decency or mainstream Protestant organizations.

Swedenborgianism, with its denial of the physical resurrection, its non-Trinitarian view of God (Swedenborg argued the Trinity existed within the person of Jesus Christ, not as three persons), and its claims of spirit communication, was viewed by many mainstream denominations as heretical or "spiritist." To depict Johnny explicitly preaching Swedenborgianism would have invited controversy and potential censorship. A generic "Christian" Johnny was a safe, Code-compliant hero.

### **3.3 The Shift to "Americana" and Civic Religion**

The post-war period saw a rise in "Americana" in Disney’s output (*So Dear to My Heart*, *Davy Crockett*). As the Cold War dawned, there was a cultural push to define "Americanism" against "Godless Communism." This resulted in the promotion of a generalized "Judeo-Christian" civic religion—a faith defined by "moral and spiritual values" rather than sectarian dogma. Walt Disney himself subscribed to this view, writing in 1949 that "Deeds rather than words express my concept of the part religion should play in everyday life". A Johnny Appleseed who represents "Faith" (broadly defined) fit this national project; a Johnny Appleseed who represents the Church of the New Jerusalem did not.

## **IV. The Creative Intelligence: Investigating the Creators**

The claim that the erasure was due to "ignorance" crumbles when we examine the personnel involved in the production. The team assembled for *Melody Time* possessed deep knowledge of American folklore and religious history.

### **4.1 Carl Carmer: The Folklore Consultant**

The most significant evidence of the studio’s awareness is the credit of **Carl Carmer** as "Folklore Consultant" for the film. Carmer (1893–1976) was not a casual hire; he was a preeminent historian, author, and academic, known for works like *Stars Fell on Alabama* and *The Hurricane’s Children*.

* **Carmer’s Expertise:** Carmer was an expert on American regional myths. He was intimately familiar with the foundational texts of the Appleseed legend, specifically W.D. Haley’s 1871 article in *Harper’s New Monthly Magazine*. This article is the primary source for the "Johnny Appleseed" mythos and *explicitly* details Chapman’s Swedenborgian faith, quoting his "news right fresh from heaven" line and describing his tract-distribution method.  
* **The Consultant’s Role:** As a consultant, Carmer’s job was to provide the studio with the "real" story, which the story team would then adapt (or distort) for entertainment. It is inconceivable that Carmer would have failed to mention Chapman’s religion in his briefings. His presence confirms that the studio had access to the full historical profile of the man.

### **4.2 The Story Team: Hibler and Penner**

The segment was written by a team including **Winston Hibler**, **Erdman Penner**, and **Joe Rinaldi**.

* **Erdman Penner:** Penner’s background is particularly relevant. Born in Canada to a **Mennonite** father and a **Roman Catholic** mother , Penner grew up navigating distinct, often marginalized, Christian identities. This biographical detail suggests a sensitivity to sectarian differences. The decision to homogenize Johnny’s faith was likely made by a writer who understood exactly what he was removing, rather than one who simply didn't know the difference.  
* **Winston Hibler:** Later the voice of Disney’s *True-Life Adventures*, Hibler was known for his literary literacy. He adapted the script for the record albums as well , showing a deep engagement with the narrative mechanics of the story.

### **4.3 Mary Blair: The Swedenborgian Connection**

Perhaps the most startling finding of this investigation is the connection between **Mary Blair**, the film’s Art Director/Color Stylist, and the Swedenborgian Church.

* **The Fact:** Archival records from *The New Church Messenger* confirm that a **"Mrs. Mary Blair" was confirmed into the Swedenborgian Church at the Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes on December 23, 1974**.  
* **The Analysis:** While this confirmation occurred 26 years after *Melody Time*, it raises profound questions about her relationship with the faith during the production. The Wayfarers Chapel (designed by Lloyd Wright, son of Frank Lloyd Wright) is a Swedenborgian landmark. Did Blair’s work on *Johnny Appleseed* introduce her to the faith? Or did she already harbor Swedenborgian sympathies in 1948 that influenced her visual design?  
* **Visual Correspondence:** Blair’s art style in the film—characterized by flatness, luminosity, and a distinct lack of separation between the "natural" and the "supernatural"—mirrors the Swedenborgian doctrine of *Influx*. The clouds in the film are not just vapor; they are "apple blossoms," blurring the line between the sky and the orchard. Even if she was not a member in 1948, her aesthetic sensibilities were singularly aligned with the Swedenborgian worldview she would later formally embrace.

## **V. The "Generic Bible" Strategy: Strategic Ambiguity**

If the creators knew Chapman was Swedenborgian, why the "Generic Bible"? The evidence points to a strategy of **Strategic Ambiguity**.

### **5.1 The Prop as Symbol**

In animation, visual economy is paramount. A book labeled "Arcana Coelestia" is a confusing detail that requires verbal exposition. A black book with gold tooling is a universal symbol for "Piety." By using the visual language of the Bible, Disney communicated Johnny’s *character* (good, faithful, literate) without engaging his *dogma*.

### **5.2 "The Blessings Three": A Coded Creed?**

While the book was generic, the script introduced a specific theological triad that served as a covert nod to Swedenborgianism. The lyrics of the film’s songs, written by **Kim Gannon** and **Walter Kent** , emphasize three things Johnny leaves behind:  
*"Love, and Faith, and the Apple Tree."*  
This phrase, often repeated in the narration, is not merely a rhyme. It is a precise translation of the Swedenborgian **Trinity of Essentials**:

1. **Love (Charity):** The Will / The desire to do good.  
2. **Faith (Truth):** The Understanding / The knowledge of God.  
3. **The Apple Tree (Works/Use):** The external manifestation of Love and Faith in the natural world.

Swedenborg explicitly teaches that "Charity and Faith make one in Good Works". By adopting this triad, the filmmakers preserved the *structural* core of Chapman’s theology while stripping away the sectarian terminology.

### **5.3 The Florence Murdoch Correspondence**

The most definitive proof that the studio navigated this issue consciously lies in the correspondence between Disney and **Florence Murdoch**. Murdoch was a devout Swedenborgian, librarian at the Cincinnati Church of the New Jerusalem, and custodian of a massive Johnny Appleseed archive.

* **The Protest:** In 1948, Murdoch wrote to Walt Disney after seeing an ad depicting Johnny’s angel wearing a **coonskin cap**. She expressed concern that the studio was taking liberties with spiritual dignity. However, she explicitly **praised** the inclusion of the "Blessings Three" phrase, recognizing it as compatible with Chapman’s actual beliefs.  
* **The Defense:** **Hal Adelquist**, Disney’s Story Department Manager, replied to Murdoch. He stated that the studio had **"researched the real life character extensively,"** confirming they were aware of the Swedenborgian connection. He defended the film as a "sermon on... brotherly love and unselfishness."  
* **The Outcome:** This exchange proves the studio was not ignorant. They had done the research, likely via Carmer, and made deliberate choices to adapt the theology into a form that was respectful but chemically altered for mass consumption. Murdoch’s eventual acceptance of the film suggests that even the New Church saw the "Blessings Three" as a valid translation.

## **VI. Theological Forensics: Traces of Swedenborg in the Animation**

If we look past the "generic Bible," does the film contain actual Swedenborgian elements? The research suggests that the narrative structure of the film is deeply, if inadvertently, Swedenborgian.

### **6.1 The Angel as "Pioneer Spirit"**

In standard Christian iconography of the 1940s, angels were distinct created beings, often depicted as cherubs or winged seraphim. Disney’s angel for Johnny is radically different.

* **The Depiction:** He is a transparent, rugged pioneer, wearing a hat (the controversial coonskin cap) and smoking a pipe (in concept art, toned down in the film). He speaks in the vernacular and identifies himself as Johnny’s "private guardian angel."  
* **Swedenborgian Alignment:** Swedenborg explicitly taught that **angels are not a separate species**, but are the spirits of deceased human beings who have lived in accordance with divine order. They retain their human form, personality, and idiosyncratic traits.  
* **The Insight:** By depicting the angel as a "frontier spirit"—a man who lived and died and now guides Johnny—Disney provided a more accurate *Swedenborgian* depiction of an angel than a traditional "Biblical" angel would have been. This aligns with Carmer’s influence as a folklore expert.

### **6.2 The Kingdom of Uses (The Ending)**

The film’s conclusion is the most explicitly Swedenborgian sequence in the Disney canon.

* **The Scene:** An elderly Johnny dies. His spirit separates from his body (which is left sleeping under a tree—a Swedenborgian visual of death as transition). The Angel tells him to come along. Johnny hesitates, saying his work isn't done. The Angel replies: *"Come on, Johnny... Where we're goin', we don't have many apple trees... they're low on apple trees."* Johnny joyfully grabs his seed bag and heads to the sky to plant orchards in the clouds.  
* **The Theology:** Traditional Protestantism often views heaven as a place of eternal rest or worship. Swedenborgianism views heaven as a **Kingdom of Uses**. Spirits continue to perform useful services that correspond to their "ruling love" on earth. A heaven that *needs* apple trees, and a soul that finds joy in planting them, is a distinctly Swedenborgian concept.  
* **The Insight:** By rejecting the "eternal rest" trope, the film validates the Swedenborgian doctrine that the afterlife is a continuation of useful labor.

### **6.3 "The Lord is Good to Me": The Hymn That Became Canon**

A critical part of the myth is the song "The Lord is Good to Me."

* **The Myth:** It is often cited as a hymn Chapman actually sung.  
* **The Reality:** It was an original composition for the film by **Kim Gannon** (lyrics) and **Walter Kent** (music).  
* **The Correspondence:** Despite being a Hollywood invention, the lyrics ("The sun and the rain and the apple seed") perfectly encapsulate Swedenborgian correspondence.  
  * *Sun* \= Divine Love.  
  * *Rain* \= Divine Truth (Water).  
  * *Seed* \= The Word/Potential Good.  
* The song was so theologically sound that it was adopted by Swedenborgian camps and hymnals after the film’s release, completing a cycle of life imitating art.

## **VII. Conclusion: Strategic Erasure, Spiritual Fidelity**

The investigation into *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* leads to a nuanced conclusion. The claim that the film lacks "direct influence" because of the generic Bible is factually correct but theologically superficial.  
**1\. Strategic Choice, Not Ignorance:** The studio, advised by Carl Carmer and researching via sources like Haley’s article, possessed full knowledge of Chapman’s Swedenborgian faith. The decision to replace tracts with a generic Bible was a calculated move to navigate the Hays Code and create a unifying American hero during the early Cold War.  
**2\. The Persistence of Structure:** While the label was erased, the structure of the faith remained. The film depicts a universe governed by Swedenborgian rules:

* **Angels are deceased humans.**  
* **Heaven is a place of useful work (planting trees).**  
* **Salvation is the union of Love, Faith, and Works ("Blessings Three").**

**3\. The Role of the Creators:** The creative team was uniquely suited to this translation. Erdman Penner’s background in minority sects, Carl Carmer’s folklore expertise, and Mary Blair’s aesthetic sensibility (which eventually led her to the New Church) combined to create a work that felt "spiritually true" even if it was "factually generic."  
**Verdict:** The "Generic Bible" was a Trojan Horse. By stripping away the controversial sectarian label, Disney created a vessel that allowed the core Swedenborgian ethos—that religion is a life of useful service and that the natural world corresponds to the spiritual—to be consumed and beloved by millions who would have rejected the explicit doctrine. In erasing the name of the church, Disney inadvertently canonized its theology for the American century.

### **Summary Table: Evidence of Swedenborgian Influence vs. Erasure**

| Element | Historical Fact (Swedenborgian) | Disney Film Depiction (1948) | Verdict on Influence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Holy Text** | Distributed Swedenborg tracts (*Arcana Coelestia*). | Carries generic "Holy Book" (Visual Bible). | **Strategic Erasure:** Avoids Hays Code "controversy" and sect alienation. |
| **The Angel** | Believed in communication with spirits of deceased humans. | "Pioneer Angel" is a deceased human spirit, not a cherub. | **Direct Influence:** Preserves Swedenborgian angelology over pop-culture tropes. |
| **Afterlife** | "Kingdom of Uses" – work continues in heaven. | Johnny plants trees in heaven because they are "low on them." | **Direct Influence:** Preserves the doctrine of useful service in the afterlife. |
| **Philosophy** | Union of Charity and Faith in Use. | "Love, Faith, and an Apple Tree." | **Translation:** Adapts doctrine into folklore vernacular ("Blessings Three"). |
| **Consultant** | N/A | Carl Carmer (Folklore Expert). | **Proof of Knowledge:** Carmer knew the Swedenborg history; advised on the adaptation. |
| **Art Direction** | N/A | Mary Blair (Confirmed Swedenborgian, 1974). | **Aesthetic Influence:** Visual style reflects "Correspondence" and spiritual influx. |

The "generic Bible" was a prop. The film surrounding it was a Swedenborgian parable.
