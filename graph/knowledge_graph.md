### Consciousness Studies
*NDEs, past-life research, consciousness-driven evolution, post-mortem models*

#### [CONSC-001] Hemispheric Worldviews as Ontological Modes

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: 0.48

> The right hemisphere (“Master”) attends to reality as an embodied, relational, flowing whole, while the left (“Emissary”) constructs a decontextualized, controllable map; the corpus callosum gates integration, so the lived world shifts with which mode predominates.


**Source Chain**:
1. [T] data/01_Consciousness_Studies/Brain, Myth, and Conscious Choice.md

**Connections**:
- → `FND-TEST-001` (developed_by): Foundational test anchor develops hemispheric worldview concept
- → `CONSC-002` (develops): Hypothesis derives from hemispheric worldview concept
- → `CONSC-003` (develops): Neuroplasticity/attention hypothesis developed from hemispheric worldview concept

#### [CONSC-002] Left-Hemisphere Dominance Drives Division and Materialist Culture

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: 0.565

> When the Emissary’s narrow, utilitarian mode dominates, neural patterns (greed, threat vigilance, ego-centricity) cascade into psychological materialism, meaning crisis, and cultural architectures that reward fragmentation (standardized testing, social media echo chambers).

#### [CONSC-003] Directed Attention and Contemplative Practice Rebalance Hemispheres

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: 0.565

> Neuroplasticity is steered by intentional attention; practices like mindfulness and compassion training systematically strengthen integrative networks and down-regulate threat circuits, enabling a voluntary shift toward the Master’s empathic, connected mode.

#### [CONSC-004] Integrated Mind and Participatory Cosmos

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: 0.48

#### [BIBL-001] Literary Analysis of New Testament Texts

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: 0.3
