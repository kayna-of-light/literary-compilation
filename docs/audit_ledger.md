# Source & Claim Audit Ledger

**Purpose**: Running state for the source and claim audit of the `data/` library — what is done, what is in flight, and what the next run needs to know.
**Procedure**: [`NIGHTLY_SOURCE_AUDIT.md`](NIGHTLY_SOURCE_AUDIT.md)

Each nightly run starts as a fresh session with no memory of the last one. This file is the only thing that carries across. Treat it as the job's working memory, not as a report.

## Next run starts here

**Replaced wholesale at the end of every run.** This block describes the present, not the history — history goes in the run log below. A run that leaves this stale has failed its successor.

> **Status**: Not yet started. Queue is the full library.
>
> **Take next**: First batch per the selection priority in the procedure § 2. Selection is by document state, never by folder or subject area — no thematic part of the library leads.
>
> **Propagation debt**: None.
>
> **Awaiting external answers**: None.
>
> **Worth knowing**: Two `EVOLVING_CONCEPTUAL_STRAINS.md` items are open for corpus-wide re-audit, both from 2026-08-20 — **#16** Pillar 43 Historical Encoding (earlier annotations need replacing, not extending) and **#26** Paleolithic Geometric Signs. Documents touching either are high priority once the Framework folder is through.

## How to read the tables

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Date** | Run date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| **Document** | Path relative to `data/` |
| **Sources** | Citations verified / total found |
| **Corrections** | Fixed in place (F) · Annotated (A) · Flagged `[TRACE NEEDED]` (T) |
| **Propagated** | Files outside the batch that received the same correction |
| **Open** | Research questions logged |
| **Outcome** | `in-progress` · `clean` · `corrected` · `partial` · `blocked` · `released` |

Rows are append-only — a later correction to a row goes in a new row, never by editing history. The one exception is flipping `in-progress` to a final outcome at the end of the run that claimed it.

A document counts as audited only after a **complete** read and source pass. Files touched solely by correction propagation appear in the **Propagated** column of the row that caused them; they are not audited and stay in the queue.

**`in-progress` rows are claims.** A run writes them and pushes before auditing, so a session that dies leaves a visible trace instead of silently losing its work. A claim older than 48 hours with no open PR is a dead run: release those documents back to the queue with a `released` row and note the dead branch in the run log. Never resume someone else's claim — you cannot know how far it got.

## Pattern register

Recurring defect classes and how to handle them. **This is what makes the job compound** — without it, night 8 rediscovers from scratch what night 3 already worked out, and handles it differently.

Add an entry when a problem looks like it will recur. Update the existing entry rather than adding a near-duplicate.

| Pattern | What it looks like | Handling | Seen in |
|---|---|---|---|
| _None recorded yet._ | | | |

Candidates to watch for in early runs, from the corpus's history — confirm before treating any as established:

- Much of this library came out of Gemini Deep Research. Generated bibliographies are the usual place fabricated or subtly wrong citations hide, and a citation pointing at an internal document may be standing in front of an external original (`CLAUDE.md` § Source Tracing, rule 2).
- Statistics travel between documents by copying. A figure wrong in one place is likely wrong in several — always grep the number itself.
- `EVOLVING_CONCEPTUAL_STRAINS.md` records that header-only annotations failed once already: NotebookLM fragments documents and does not carry context across sections. Every occurrence needs an adjacent inline note.

## Run log

Narrative per run — what the batch surfaced, and anything a later run should know that does not fit the tables. Newest first. Unlike the handoff block, this accumulates.

### 2026-09-20 — Ledger opened

Nightly audit configured. Queue is the full library: 250 documents, none audited.

Starting conditions:

- **83** documents carry a bibliography section; the rest cite inline or not at all
- **46** already carry an editorial header block
- **24** still contain `drive.google.com` links (`scripts/normalize_internal_links.py`)
- **2** use the `[P]`/`[S]`/`[T]`/`[E]`/`[W]` type codes from the Source Tracing Protocol — so type-coding will be a large share of early work
- `EVOLVING_CONCEPTUAL_STRAINS.md` has two open items: **#16** Pillar 43 Historical Encoding and **#26** Paleolithic Geometric Signs, both opened 2026-08-20

At 3 documents per night this is roughly an 80-night pass. Depth per document matters more than pace.
