# **A Validation Analysis of Claims Concerning the Most Ancient Church**

### **Introduction: A New Framework for Analysis**

An 18th-century theological framework details the communication of the "most ancient people," describing a "Golden Age" of "celestial men." When the mystical context is set aside to examine the functional *descriptions* of communication, a remarkable pattern emerges. The theological sequence of "Ages"—a "Golden Age" that *contains* the evolutionary driver of its own "Fall," and a subsequent "Ancient Church"—does not align with a fixed historical date. Instead, it functions as an allegorical narrative for the entire, multi-million-year *trajectory* of hominin evolution. This report details this functional alignment, mapping the theological ages to the deep paleoanthropological record.

### **1\. The "Golden Age" (Most Ancient Church) — Deep Origins and Cognitive Shift**

The "most ancient church" is described as a "Golden Age," symbolized by "Man, or Adam." These "celestial men" possessed a unique mode of being. When their key attributes are analyzed as functional descriptions, they align not with *Homo sapiens* of 40,000 BCE, but with the foundational evolutionary adaptations that first separated hominins from other primates millions of years ago.  
This age, however, is not static; it contains the very evolutionary driver for its own transformation—a "Fall" that is not a period, but a *process* of cognitive externalization.

#### **A. The Baseline State (Deep Origins)**

* **"Internal Respiration":** The narrative describes a "tacit" (silent) "internal respiration" that enabled "profound ideas of thought." This functionally aligns with two scientific principles:  
  1. **Paleoanthropology:** The decoupling of breathing from locomotion, a necessary adaptation for bipedalism in early hominins like *Australopithecus*.  
  2. **Neuroscience:** The link between controlled, non-vocal breathing and "profound thought." Slow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, promoting autonomic relaxation and enhancing cognitive states.  
* **"Lip-Speech":** Communication was silent, achieved "not so much by words" but by "innumerable changes of the... lips." This aligns with the "Gestural Theory" of language origin, which posits that language began with gestures, including facial movements. The evolution of tool use "freed" hominin facial musculature from food processing, "co-opting" it for complex visual communication. This process has deep roots, beginning with the evolution of facial expression in primates.  
* **"Representative Language":** These people perceived the world through "representatives," where a concrete object (like a 'high mountain' or 'fruit') was instantly understood as its abstract meaning ('heaven/Lord' or 'love/charity'). This is a perfect description of **Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT)**, which holds that all abstract thought is "grounded" in concrete, sensorimotor experiences. The example of 'mountain' \= 'heaven/power' is a textbook 'VERTICALITY' schema. Cognitive archaeology places the roots of this "abstract thinking" in the Lower Paleolithic, suggesting the capacity for analogy was a prerequisite for *Acheulean toolmaking*.

#### **B. The "Fall": The Evolutionary Driver of Externalization**

The theological narrative describes the "Fall" as the *culminating process* of this "Golden Age." It is the cognitive shift that *causes* the transition to a new state of being.

* **Theological Narrative:** The driver of this process is the "Serpent," which represents the *sensual principle*—the part of the mind that reasons from external, sensory data rather than internal perception. The "Fall" is the story of cognition "decoupling"—"Eve" (the external aspect of man) turning away from "Adam" (the internal, innate understanding) to be guided by the "Serpent" (sensual, external data).  
* **Scientific Alignment:** This describes the *cognitive necessity* for a new form of communication. As innate, silent perception "ceased," thought had to be *externalized*. This decoupling *drove* the biological evolution of articulate speech. This is the evolutionary "trade-off" identified by science: the "tacit internal respiration" was "overwritten" by "external respiration," which *enabled* "a language of words". This required a new biological adaptation: *fine neurological control* of the respiratory muscles (expanded thoracic innervation), which evolved over the vast period between 1.6 million and 100,000 years ago.

### **2\. The "Ancient Church" (Silver Age) — The Age of Externalized Knowledge**

This next theological age, the "Ancient Church," (or "Silver Age" ) encompasses the entire period *after* the "Fall." It is the *result* of this cognitive shift, beginning with the maturation of this new, externalized cognition and ending in its full-blown, self-serving culmination.

#### **A. Phase 1: The Maturation (Upper Paleolithic)**

* **Theological Narrative:** The people of the "Ancient Church" were "spiritual," not "celestial." They lacked innate "perception" and instead had to *learn* truth externally, relying on a "knowledge *about* correspondences" (a learned, external symbolic system).  
* **Scientific Alignment:** This narrative of a "learned" symbolic system aligns perfectly with the scientific understanding of the Upper Paleolithic (c. 40,000–10,000 BCE). This period is not one of *origins*, but of *maturation* and "behavioral modernity."  
  * **The "Symbolic Explosion":** The "knowledge *about* correspondences" is now externalized. This is the era of prolific cave paintings, carved figurines, and complex ritual burials—all of which are external, learned, and culturally-transmitted symbolic systems.  
  * **Anatomical Maturation:** *Homo sapiens* now possessed the fully "modern-like" anatomy for speech, including the descended larynx and modern hyoid bone morphology, which had been evolving for hundreds of thousands of years. The "language of words" was now fully mature.

#### **B. Phase 2: The Culmination (The "Babylonian" State)**

* **Theological Narrative:** This is the *culmination* of the "Ancient Church" trajectory. The reliance on external, sensual knowledge, now fully decoupled from its internal source, is *misused* for self-serving, external power. This is the state allegorized by "Babylon."  
* **Scientific/Historical Alignment:** This maps to the scientific Bronze Age (c. 1200 BCE) and the rise of empires. As an artifact of this period, the Babylonian myth *Enuma Elish* is not a simple creation story, but a *political document* that reflects this cognitive state.  
  * **Myth as Political Tool:** The *Enuma Elish* functions to legitimize the *external* political dominance of the city of Babylon and its god, Marduk. It consciously revises older Sumerian myths to serve this new, external power structure.  
  * **Reflection of a "Fallen" Humanity:** Its depiction of humanity's creation—where humans (Lullu) are made from the blood of a rebel god—is a *reflection* of this mindset. Humans exist for the sole purpose of being *slaves* to serve the *external desires* ("maintenance") of the gods, freeing the gods from work. This is the ultimate expression of a society that has externalized all value to serve sensual, temporal power.

### **Summary of Alignment**

The theological narrative, when analyzed functionally, serves as a sophisticated allegory for the entire evolutionary sequence of hominin communication and cognition.

| **Golden Age (Most Ancient Church)** | Silent, gestural, and metaphorical thought; innate perception. | **Origins of Human Traits (Lower/Middle Paleolithic)** • Decoupling of breath (Bipedalism) • Gestural Theory / "Freed" facial muscles • Conceptual Metaphor (Acheulean toolmaking) |
| **The "Fall" (as driver)** | **Cognitive Decoupling:** "Eve" (External) guided by "Serpent" (Sensual), *driving* the need for external, articulate speech. | **Evolution of Articulate Speech (1.6 Mya–100,000 ya)**\<br/\>• Evolutionary trade-off for *fine breath control* (thoracic innervation) |
| **Ancient Church (Phase 1\)** | **Maturation** of externalized cognition; "knowledge *about* correspondences" (learned symbolism). | **Upper Paleolithic (40,000–10,000 BCE)** • "Symbolic explosion" in art and ritual • Fully modern speech anatomy |
| **Ancient Church (Phase 2\)** | **Culmination** of externalization; knowledge *misused* for sensual/external power (the "Babylonian" state). | **Scientific Bronze Age (c. 1200 BCE)** • *Enuma Elish* as a political artifact reflecting a "slave"-based, externalized worldview |
