## **I. Introduction: The Epistemological Fracture and the Search for Origins**

The history of religious thought is frequently narrated as a linear progression from primitive animism to sophisticated monotheism, a steady ascent from the "magical" to the "moral." Standard historiographies often treat the dietary laws, ritual purities, and symbolic worldviews of the Hebrew Bible as late priestly inventions, imposed during the Babylonian Exile (c. 6th century BCE) to preserve Jewish identity in the face of assimilation. However, a rigorous examination of the archaeological, textual, and cognitive record reveals a more complex reality: the persistence of a specific, coherent ontology that governed the ancient worldview from its earliest emergence in the Late Bronze Age through its crystallization in the Exilic period, and potentially stretching back into the deep time of human consciousness.

This ontology, often termed the "Doctrine of Correspondences," posits a causal and immutable relationship between the spiritual realm (*causa*) and the natural world (*effectus*). In this view, the physical universe is not a closed system of material interactions but a semiotic field where every animal, plant, mineral, and celestial event functions as a "letter" in a divine alphabet, articulating invisible spiritual realities.1 The modern mind, conditioned by the Cartesian bifurcation of *res cogitans* (mind) and *res extensa* (matter), often struggles to grasp this unified field of perception. To the ancient observer, the appearance of a comet or the behavior of a serpent was not a random datum but a legible text, a manifestation of a higher order pressing into the material plane.

Recent research into early biblical history has suggested that during the composition of the Hebrew Bible (roughly 600 BCE and onwards), the intellectual world of the Near East was dominated by this thought of correspondence, particularly under the influence of the Magian (Zoroastrian) priesthood of the Iranian empires. This worldview linked dietary habits and animal taxonomy to spiritual qualities, classifying creatures not merely by biological morphology but by their alignment with cosmic order (*Asha* or *Ma'at*).1 However, the hypothesis under investigation posits that this "science of correspondences" was not merely a late Exilic imposition but was already prevalent in the region as early as 1200 BCE, rooted in the "Shasu" nomads and the broader "Eastern" wisdom traditions (*Bene Qedem*) from which the early Israelites emerged.

Even more radically, the inquiry extends backwards to the very dawn of human cognition. The 18th-century scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg proposed a period of "intrinsic knowing"—a "Most Ancient Church" or Golden Age—where humanity possessed a direct, perceptual knowledge of correspondences, unmediated by written doctrine. This report undertakes an exhaustive analysis of this deep-time hypothesis. By triangulating zooarchaeological data regarding the "pig taboo," Egyptian topographical texts concerning the "Shasu of Yahweh," the sapiential traditions of the *Bene Qedem*, and modern cognitive archaeology regarding the "Neolithic Revolution" and the "Bicameral Mind," we argue that the "Doctrine of Correspondences" is the fossilized remnant of a primordial cognitive state.

The evidence suggests that the dietary prohibitions and animal symbolisms found in the Bible were not late inventions but the codification of a much older, nomadic "nature wisdom" that viewed the physical world—and specifically the animal kingdom—as a mirror of the divine. Furthermore, this "science" appears to be the systematized debris of a lost mode of consciousness, described by Owen Barfield as "Original Participation" and by Julian Jaynes as the "Bicameral Mind," where the boundary between the "self" and the "world" was permeable, and nature spoke directly to the human mind. The investigation reveals that what later became "doctrine" and "law" in the Priestly Code was originally "perception" and "experience" in the Paleolithic and Neolithic epochs.

## **II. The Shasu Complex: The Nomadic Matrix of Yahwism**

To root the "pig taboo" and the science of correspondences in the period of 1200 BCE, we must first examine the Shasu, the nomadic group identified by many scholars as the "proto-Israelites" or at least a core component of the ethnogenesis of Israel. The archaeological and textual evidence concerning the Shasu provides the "missing link" between the wisdom of the East and the Levitical codes of the Bible. The question is not merely one of ethnic identification but of intellectual heritage: did these nomads possess the sophisticated semiotic framework necessary to construct a "science of correspondences"?

### **2.1 The "Shasu of Yahweh" in Egyptian Topography**

The term Shasu (*š3sw*) appears in Egyptian texts from the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550–1150 BCE) to designate Semitic-speaking pastoral nomads in the Southern Levant and Transjordan.1 Deriving from the Egyptian root "to wander," the term was a sociological label rather than a strict ethnic one, but it came to be associated with specific groups in Edom, Seir, and Moab. These groups were distinct from the urban Canaanites (*Amu*) and were often depicted as enemies of the Egyptian state, engaging in skirmishes and controlling trade routes.

The most explosive evidence linking the Shasu to Israel is found in the topographical lists of Amenhotep III (c. 1390 BCE) at Soleb and Ramesses II (c. 1279 BCE) at Amara West. These lists mention a "Land of the Shasu of Yhw" (*t3 š3sw yhw3*).1 This is universally recognized by scholars as the earliest extra-biblical reference to the Tetragrammaton, the divine name of the God of Israel.

The location of this "Land of Yahweh" is crucial for our hypothesis. The Egyptian lists associate it with Seir and Edom.1 This aligns perfectly with the ancient biblical poetry that describes Yahweh marching from the south: "The LORD came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran" (Deuteronomy 33:2; cf. Judges 5:4, Habakkuk 3:3).1 The convergence of Egyptian epigraphy and biblical tradition points to a "Southern Origin" for Yahwism. The cult of Yahweh originated among the Shasu nomads of the southern steppe (Midian/Edom) before entering the Canaanite highlands.

This geographical placement is significant because Edom and Seir were regions associated with the *Bene Qedem* ("Children of the East"), a people renowned for their wisdom and their closeness to the natural world. Unlike the urban Canaanites, whose religion was mediated by temples and state hierarchies, the Shasu practiced a mobile, aniconic faith. Their god, Yahweh, was associated with the mountains and the storm, elements of the raw, unmediated environment. If the Shasu were the original Yahwists, their cultural practices—including their diet—become the baseline for "Israelite" religion.

### **2.2 The Midianite-Kenite Hypothesis and Metallurgical Wisdom**

The "Midianite Hypothesis" (or Kenite Hypothesis) posits that the Israelites adopted Yahweh from the Midianites/Kenites, a Shasu-like group inhabiting the Arabah and northwestern Arabia.1 The Bible preserves this memory in the figure of Jethro, the "Priest of Midian" and father-in-law of Moses, who advises Moses on legal administration and offers sacrifices to Yahweh (Exodus 18).1 The very name "Kenite" (*Qeni*) is derived from the Semitic root for "smith" or "metalworker" 1, linking this group inextricably to the transformative arts of metallurgy.

Archaeology at Timna (see Section V) confirms a sophisticated Midianite culture capable of metallurgy and cultic activity in the 13th–12th centuries BCE.1 These groups possessed a distinct material culture and, crucially, a distinct relationship with the animal world and the mineral kingdom. Metallurgy was not merely a technical trade in the ancient world; it was a sacred science, a form of alchemy that transformed matter (stones) into spirit/power (copper/bronze) through the agency of fire. The smelter was a magician who understood the "correspondences" of the earth.

This connection to metallurgy provides a vital clue to the "Science of Correspondences." The transformation of ore into metal was viewed as a birth process, an acceleration of nature's slow growth. The Kenites, as masters of this fire, would have been the custodians of a deep knowledge regarding the hidden properties of the natural world. The association of Yahweh with this metallurgical group suggests that the deity was, from the beginning, a god of transformation and "hidden fire," a god whose worship required a sophisticated understanding of the correspondence between the physical act of smelting and the spiritual act of purification.5

### **2.3 The Zooarchaeology of Exclusion: The Pig Taboo**

The user’s query highlights the absence of pork bones in early Jewish settlements (c. 1200 BCE) as evidence of a pre-existing doctrine. A superficial reading might suggest a simple materialist cause: pigs are ecologically unsuited for nomads. However, to the ancient mind, material reality and spiritual truth were not separate spheres. The ecological unsuitability of the pig was not merely an inconvenience; it was a revelation of the animal's ontological nature.

Extensive zooarchaeological surveys of Iron Age I sites in the central hill country of Canaan (the heartland of early Israel) have revealed a striking pattern: an almost total absence of pig bones.1 At sites like Mount Ebal, Shiloh, and 'Izbet Sartah, pig remains constitute less than 1% of the faunal assemblage.1 This stands in sharp contrast to the coastal plain, settled by the Philistines (Sea Peoples) around the same time. At Philistine urban centers like Ekron and Ashdod, pig bones make up 10–20% of the assemblage.1

This sharp dichotomy—pork-eating Philistines on the coast vs. pig-avoiding Israelites in the highlands—has led scholars to argue that the pig taboo was a primary "ethnic marker".1 However, the absence of pigs is not limited to the Israelite highlands; it is also a feature of the Shasu and Edomite sites in the south.

For the Shasu and early Israelites, the "science of correspondences" functioned by observing the behavior and biology of an animal to determine its spiritual quality. The pig is sedentary by nature; it cannot migrate effectively with a nomadic flock. It competes with humans for water and grain. In the "correspondial" worldview, these physical limitations were read as spiritual markers. The pig was "of the earth," bound to the mud, unable to ascend or migrate. It corresponded to the "sedentary chaos" of the urban Canaanites and Philistines, who were viewed as spiritually corrupt. By rejecting the pig, the Shasu were not just making an economic choice; they were making an ontological statement about their alignment with the God of the Wilderness, the God of Movement.1

## **III. The Bene Qedem and the Wisdom Tradition: The Science of Lists**

While the Shasu provide the *sociological* matrix for early Yahwism, the intellectual framework of the "Doctrine of Correspondences" finds its roots in the broader wisdom traditions of the Ancient Near East, specifically those of the *Bene Qedem* ("Children of the East"). The Bible explicitly compares Solomon’s wisdom to the "wisdom of all the people of the East (*Bene Qedem*) and all the wisdom of Egypt" (1 Kings 4:30).1 Who were these "Children of the East," and what was the nature of their wisdom?

### **3.1 The Taxonomy of Nature: *Listenwissenschaft***

The wisdom of the *Bene Qedem* was not abstract philosophy in the Greek sense; it was empirical, observational, and taxonomic. It relied on what scholars call *Listenwissenschaft* ("The Science of Lists"), a mode of knowledge organization deeply embedded in the Mesopotamian and West Semitic spheres.11 This tradition involved the exhaustive cataloging of natural phenomena—stars, stones, trees, animals, and gods—in order to map the order of the universe.

The assumption underlying *Listenwissenschaft* is that the universe is a coherent, legible text. By naming and categorizing every element of creation, the scribe could understand its essence and its relationship to the divine order. 1 Kings 4:33 describes Solomon’s wisdom as the ability to "speak of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall," and to "speak also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish".1 This fourfold classification—Beasts, Fowl, Creeping Things, Fishes—mirrors the taxonomic structures found in Leviticus 11 and the Magian *Damdat Nask*.1 It suggests that Solomonic wisdom was a mastery of the "science of correspondences," a capacity to read the spiritual significance of every biological form.

### **3.2 The *Apkallu* and Antediluvian Wisdom**

This tradition of wisdom was believed to be extremely ancient, predating the Flood. In Mesopotamian mythology, civilization and wisdom were brought to humanity by the *Apkallu* (Seven Sages), semi-divine beings who emerged from the *Apsu* (the watery abyss) before the Deluge.16 The *Apkallu* taught humanity the *me* (divine powers/arts), including agriculture, writing, and magic.

The Jewish tradition assimilated this concept in the figure of Enoch. In the Enochic literature (1 Enoch), Enoch acts as the "Scribe of Righteousness" who receives the secrets of the cosmos from the angels (the Watchers) before the Flood.19 Like the *Apkallu*, Enoch preserves this knowledge for future generations. Swedenborg explicitly links Enoch to the preservation of the "Science of Correspondences." He states that "Enoch... and those associated with him collected correspondences from the lips of these men \[of the Most Ancient Church\], and transmitted this knowledge to their posterity".21

This connects the "Wisdom of the East" directly to the idea of a lost, primordial knowledge. The *Bene Qedem* were seen as the inheritors of this antediluvian wisdom, the custodians of the "Ancient Word" that preceded the Torah. The "Science of Correspondences" was thus not a new invention but a survival, a fragment of a lost wholeness that the sages of the East and the priests of Israel sought to reconstruct.

### **3.3 The Magian Interface: *Mēnōg* and *Gētīg***

The "Doctrine of Correspondences" finds its most rigorous philosophical articulation in the Iranian (Magian) sphere, which profoundly influenced Exilic Judaism. The Zoroastrian concepts of *mēnōg* (spiritual/mental) and *gētīg* (material/physical) describe two states of a single reality. The *mēnōg* is the realm of the seed and the archetype; the *gētīg* is the realm of the fruit and the manifestation.11

In this paradigm, the physical world is the "crystallization" of the spiritual. Every animal and plant belongs to a specific spiritual hierarchy. "Beneficent" animals (like the dog and cattle) belong to the order of *Asha* (Truth/Order) and are physical manifestations of the Good Mind. "Noxious" creatures (like snakes, frogs, and scorpions) are *khrafstra*, manifestations of the Lie (*Druj*) or chaotic thought.1 This binary classification is not merely biological but ontological. To kill a *khrafstra* is a redemptive act; to eat one is to ingest spiritual poison.

This Magian dualism offers a sophisticated theoretical framework for the Levitical dietary laws. The distinction between "clean" (*tahor*) and "unclean" (*tamei*) animals in Leviticus operates on a similar logic of correspondence. Animals that conform to the "ideal" order of creation (e.g., cloven-hoofed ruminants) are clean; those that blur boundaries or exhibit "chaotic" traits (e.g., pigs, which have cloven hooves but do not chew the cud) are unclean. The "Science of Correspondences" is the method of reading these biological signs to discern spiritual alignment.

## **IV. The Metallurgical Connection: Timna and the Serpent**

The hypothesis that this "science" was linked to the Shasu is further bolstered by the archaeological evidence from Timna, a copper mining district in the southern Arabah. This site provides a unique window into the cultic life of the Midianites/Shasu during the crucial 13th–12th centuries BCE.

### **4.1 The Midianite Tent Shrine and the Copper Serpent**

Excavations at Timna have uncovered a temple originally dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Hathor. However, in the 12th century BCE (coinciding with the Iron I settlement), the Egyptians withdrew, and the site was taken over by local Midianites (a Shasu subgroup).1 These Midianites transformed the stone temple into a Tent Shrine. They covered the Egyptian structure with tent cloths (evidenced by postholes and fabric remains), effectively "nomadizing" the sacred space.1 This is a direct parallel to the biblical Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary of the Israelites.

Inside this Midianite shrine, archaeologists found a sensational object: a gilded copper serpent.1 This find connects directly to the biblical account of the "Bronze Serpent" (*Nehushtan*) in Numbers 21\. When the Israelites were bitten by "fiery serpents" (*seraphim*), Moses was instructed to make a copper serpent and set it on a pole. Those who looked at the copper serpent lived.1

This ritual is a quintessential example of correspondence or "sympathetic magic," a core component of the ancient "science." The principle is that the cure must correspond to the curse. The "fiery" nature of the venom is neutralized by the "fiery" (red/copper) nature of the image. The Hebrew word for serpent (*nachash*) and copper (*nechoshet*) share the same root, a linguistic correspondence that the ancients viewed as revealing a deep ontological link.1 The copper serpent was not an idol (initially) but a technological device operating on the laws of correspondence between the image and the reality. It channeled the "serpentine" energy to nullify the "serpentine" poison.

### **4.2 Alchemy and the Sacred Fire**

The metallurgical expertise of the Kenites/Midianites was not secular technology. The smelting of copper was a ritual act, a mimicry of the creative powers of the earth. The furnace was a womb; the fire was the transformative agent. The discovery of the copper serpent in the Holy of Holies of the Timna shrine suggests that for the Shasu, metallurgy was a primary vehicle for divine revelation. The transformation of rock into shining metal was a "correspondence" of the purification of the soul—a concept that would later be central to spiritual alchemy.

The "Science of Correspondences" thus appears to have a dual root: the pastoral taxonomy of the *Bene Qedem* (classifying animals) and the metallurgical alchemy of the Kenites (transforming minerals). Both required a deep reading of the inherent properties of matter to discern the spiritual forces within.

## **V. Deep Time Origins: The Neolithic Revolution and the Birth of Symbols**

To answer the user's question about how far back this doctrine stretches, we must look beyond the Bronze Age to the Neolithic Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE), the moment when humanity shifted from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to sedentary agriculture. This transition was not merely economic; it was a "Symbolic Revolution" that fundamentally altered human consciousness.

### **5.1 Jacques Cauvin and the "Birth of the Gods"**

The French archaeologist Jacques Cauvin argued that the Neolithic Revolution was preceded and driven by a "Revolution of Symbols".24 Before humans domesticated plants and animals, they domesticated their own minds through a new religious cosmology. Cauvin identified the emergence of the "Woman and the Bull" as the primary symbolic dyad of this era. The "Goddess" represented the source of life, while the "Bull" represented the virile, chaotic force of nature that had to be tamed.

This symbolic shift marks the beginning of "doctrine" in the Swedenborgian sense. In the Paleolithic, the spiritual was immanent in nature (see Section VI). In the Neolithic, the spiritual began to be externalized into specific symbols and icons (figurines, pillars). The "Gods" were born as distinct entities separate from the natural world, requiring mediation through ritual and image.

### **5.2 Göbekli Tepe: The Stone Library**

The most spectacular evidence of this transition is the megalithic complex of Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey (c. 9500 BCE).27 Built by hunter-gatherers, this site consists of massive T-shaped limestone pillars arranged in circles. The pillars are elaborately carved with animals: scorpions, vultures, boars, foxes, and lions.

These carvings are not merely decorative; they constitute a complex semiotic system—a "Stone Library." Some scholars interpret the T-pillars as anthropomorphic representations of the "Watchers" or "ancestors," the *Apkallu* of the Neolithic.28 The animals carved on them likely represent totemic guardians or constellations (e.g., the vulture/scorpion associated with death and the Cygnus constellation).29

Göbekli Tepe represents the first attempt to fix the "Science of Correspondences" into a permanent, monumental form. It is the transition point where the fluid, oral "Memory Code" of the Paleolithic (see below) was solidified into stone. This aligns with Swedenborg's description of the transition from the "Most Ancient Church" (perception) to the "Ancient Church" (correspondence/doctrine). The builders of Göbekli Tepe were attempting to preserve a fading wisdom by carving it into the earth itself.

## **VI. The Paleolithic Mind: Original Participation and the Memory Code**

Does the doctrine go back even further? Swedenborg speaks of a "Most Ancient Church" or Golden Age characterized by "internal respiration" and "perception," where humanity had no need for books because the world itself was their book. Modern cognitive archaeology offers a startling validation of this concept in the study of the Paleolithic mind.

### **6.1 The Memory Code and the Ancient Word**

Researcher Lynne Kelly has demonstrated that pre-literate (oral) societies possess encyclopedic knowledge of plants, animals, and stars, which they encode into the landscape and ritual objects using the "Method of Loci".30 This "Memory Code" allows indigenous elders to store vast amounts of data by associating it with physical features of the land (songlines) or handheld devices (like the *lukasa* memory board of the Luba people).34

For the Paleolithic mind, the landscape was a text. A specific rock *corresponded* to a specific plant; a bend in the river *corresponded* to a historical event. This is the functional equivalent of Swedenborg's "Ancient Word"—a universal system of knowledge preservation where the physical world serves as the container for spiritual and pragmatic truth. The "correspondence" was the mnemonic link between the object (signifier) and the knowledge (signified).

### **6.2 Geometric Signs and Proto-Writing**

Paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger has identified 32 distinct geometric signs (dots, lines, triangles, spirals) that appear in cave art across Europe and beyond, dating back 40,000 years.35 These signs are not random doodles; they are a standardized system of graphic communication—a "proto-writing."

These signs represent the first abstraction of correspondence. A "dot" or a "spiral" is not a picture of a thing; it is a symbol for an idea or a number. This capacity for abstract symbolism is the cognitive root of the "Science of Correspondences." It shows that as early as the Upper Paleolithic, humans were using physical marks to "correspond" to invisible realities.

### **6.3 Original Participation and the Bicameral Mind**

The philosopher Owen Barfield described the consciousness of early humanity as "Original Participation".38 In this state, the human subject did not stand *apart* from the object (nature) as an observer; they participated *in* the phenomena. For the "original participant," the wind was not just moving air; it was spirit (*pneuma/ruach*). The connection was not metaphorical; it was substantial.

This aligns with Julian Jaynes's hypothesis of the "Bicameral Mind".43 Jaynes argued that early humans lacked modern introspective consciousness. Instead, their right hemisphere produced auditory hallucinations (perceived as the voices of gods/ancestors) which the left hemisphere obeyed. In this state, there was no distinction between "inner" thought and "outer" reality. The world was saturated with volition. A thunderclap *was* a divine voice.

> **[CRITICAL ANALYSIS #13]** This section treats Jaynes’s "bicameral mind" as a straightforward parallel to Swedenborg’s "internal respiration." Later analysis rejects Jaynes’s automaton/hallucination reduction as archaeologically untenable (e.g., Göbekli Tepe planning; volitional mnemonic "Memory Code"). The relevant distinction is *mechanism vs. source*: neural pathways may mediate reception, but they do not explain the origin of the communicated content. See `data/unclassified/The Agency of the Ancients_ A Comprehensive Red Team Audit of the Divine Bricolage Framework via Cognitive Archaeology, Evolutionary Physiology, and Neuro-Phenomenology.md`.

The relevant distinction is *mechanism vs. source*: neural pathways may mediate reception, but they do not explain the origin of the communicated content.

Swedenborg's concept of "internal respiration" in the Most Ancient Church describes exactly this state.45 He claims that these ancients communicated via a subtle, internal perception that connected them directly to the spiritual world. They did not need "doctrine" because they lived in a state of direct correspondence. The "Fall" was the loss of this direct perception (the breakdown of the bicameral mind) and the development of the "proprium" (the modern ego/self). This necessitated the creation of external "doctrine" and "written words" to bridge the gap that had opened between man and nature.

## **VII. Synthesis: The Long Trajectory of the Sacred**

The inquiry into the "Doctrine of Correspondences" reveals that it is not a quaint theological invention of the Priestly scribes, nor merely a mystical reverie of Swedenborg. It is the fundamental operating system of the pre-modern human mind, evolving through distinct cognitive epochs.

### **7.1 Table of Correspondence Evolution**

### **7.2 Conclusion**

The "Doctrine of Correspondences" is the intellectual debris of a lost way of being. In the Paleolithic, correspondence was a lived reality—the "Memory Code" of the landscape and the "Original Participation" in nature. In the Neolithic, this direct knowing began to fade, necessitating the "Symbolic Revolution" of idols and temples (Göbekli Tepe). By the Bronze Age, the connection was so attenuated that it required the rigorous *Listenwissenschaft* of the scribes to catalog and preserve the links.

The Shasu and the early Israelites, living on the margins of the great empires, preserved a potent, nomadic form of this wisdom. They rejected the "sedentary chaos" of the pig and the city, clinging to the "nature wisdom" of the desert. When the Priestly scribes of the Exile finally wrote down the Levitical codes, they were not inventing a new theology; they were codifying the ancient, intuitive science of their ancestors—an attempt to capture in ink the echoes of a time when the world itself was the Word of God.

Thus, Swedenborg's intuition was historically astute: there *was* a time of "intrinsic knowing," and it was indeed followed by a fall into "doctrine." The "Science of Correspondences" is the bridge across that abyss—a method to read the world as if we were still in the Garden, using the intellect to recover what the heart has lost.
