The statement that the Fourth Church is "To be foretold (implicitly far in the future)" refers to the New Church, or the New Jerusalem, which is established *after* the Last Judgment of 1757\. The sources emphasize that this new church is the definitive outcome of the accomplished judgment and marks a new era, implying its longevity.  
Here is a detailed explanation of the Fourth Church drawing on the sources:  
1\. The Identity of the Fourth Church  
The Fourth Church is identified as the New Church, specifically the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven.  
• This church succeeds the former Christian Church (the Third Church), which had reached its end or "consummation of the age".  
• The destruction of the former church and the creation of a "new heaven and a new earth" (Revelation 21:1) do not mean the physical destruction of the planet, but the establishment of a new church, internally and externally.  
• The internal meaning of Revelation, which had been hidden, is now revealed to assist in the establishment of this New Church.  
2\. The Relationship to Prophecy and Futurity  
The phrase "To be foretold (implicitly far in the future)" captures the unique temporal position of the New Church: its commencement is immediate (following 1757), but its true completion and enduring existence constitute the subject of future prophecy.  
• Prophecy Fulfilled and Revealed: The events of Revelation, particularly those concerning the judgment and the destruction of the old church ("Babylon," the "first heaven," and the "first earth"), have already been fulfilled. The remaining passages of Revelation detail the state of this New Jerusalem.  
• Implied Longevity (Not Explicitly Foretold): The sources do not specify a future "Last Judgment" for the New Jerusalem in the near term, suggesting a lengthy duration. Instead, they focus on its initial establishment and ongoing growth.  
• The Fulfillment of Prophecy as the Lord's Coming: The "coming of the Lord" mentioned in prophecy is interpreted as the revelation of Divine truth through the internal sense of the Word. Since this revelation is necessary for the New Church to exist, the coming has already taken place. The continuation of the revelation for the New Church implies a new, ongoing spiritual guidance.  
3\. The Essentials and Quality of the New Church  
The New Church is defined by spiritual essentials absent or corrupted in the former Christian Church. The purpose of the Last Judgment was to make way for a church that could adhere to these truths.  
• Core Doctrine: The two essentials of the New Church are the acknowledgment of the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth and a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue (repentance).  
• Spiritual Light and Enlightenment: Since communication between heaven and earth has been restored following the Last Judgment in 1757, revelations for the new church are now possible. The church state is likened to "morning and daytime," replacing the "evening and nighttime" state of the former church.  
• The Church of Charity and Life: The New Church emphasizes that faith is to will and to put into practice what we believe. It must reject the doctrine of "faith alone," which destroyed the Third Church. Those who live according to the commandments of the Lord's Word, and consequently possess truths from good, will be saved and constitute the New Jerusalem.  
4\. The Gradual Establishment and Future Hope  
The sources acknowledge that the establishment of the New Church is gradual and faces immediate resistance, which is why its fullness is projected into the future.  
• Growth and Increase: The church is established and grows gradually, "at first be among a few, and... successively increase among many". This slow growth is necessary because the falsities of the former church must first be removed.  
• Focus on the Gentiles: The angels express "only slight hope for people of the Christian church" but "more hope for a particular group of people distant from the Christian world". These latter groups are capable of receiving spiritual light and accepting the revealed Divine truths "in their lives and in their hearts". This shift suggests the geographical and temporal future of the church is focused outside the corrupted Christian world, implying a long period for its global establishment.  
• Continued Spiritual Conflict: Even after the judgment, the New Church must contend with falsities (represented by the beast from the abyss making war with the two witnesses). Those who remain steadfast in truths from good are promised eternal life in this New Jerusalem.  
The New Jerusalem, therefore, is an ongoing state beginning in 1757, whose destiny is illuminated by the open prophecies of Revelation, securing its existence indefinitely into the future, unlike the prior churches whose respective "consummations" were definitively past.  
\---  
The new jerusalem is not describes as coming to the gentiles. Following the vision of Daniel all churches are described as one image for a reason. It is because the are all intrinsically linked to each other. Not one church exists without the other and the represent the complete fullfilment of all the churches up to the Christian church. The stone represents the Lord as to divine truth being revealed. That it rolls means a gradual revealment. That it shatters the image means that the true inner truth of the Word will shatter all external notions and thus will form a new foundation not bounded to the flow of churches as before but standing on its own grounded in the full truth of the Lord. That it has not been shattered before is because people have never been in full truth and all they believe in in the end are external representations which will be shattered when the time is ripe.  
\---  
You present a sophisticated argument synthesizing the concept of successive churches and the prophetic vision of Daniel's statue, asserting that the New Jerusalem should be understood as a *completion* of the prior churches, intrinsically linked to them, and founded on the shattering of external notions by Divine Truth.  
The sources strongly support your interpretation of Daniel's vision and the intrinsic linkage between successive churches, while simultaneously contradicting your initial premise by extensively confirming that the New Jerusalem is indeed established primarily among the Gentiles (or nations).  
Here is an analysis drawn entirely from the sources regarding your statement:  
1\. The New Jerusalem is Established with the Gentiles  
The sources explicitly and repeatedly state that the New Church (New Jerusalem) is established with the Gentiles, as the former Christian Church, like its predecessors, was vastated and rejected due to a failure of charity.  
• Transfer of the Church to Gentiles: When any church "becomes no church, that is, when charity perishes and a new church is being set up again by the Lord, this is effected rarely if ever with those who are within the church, but with those who were without, that is, with the Gentiles". This happened when the Most Ancient Church perished (transfer to Noah/Ancient Church, which was among Gentiles where there was no church before), and when the Jewish Church was consummated (primitive church set up from the Gentiles, the Jews being rejected).  
• The Christian Church Follows the Pattern: The sources state this pattern "will be with this church, which is called Christian".  
• Hope Lies Outside the Christian World: The New Church is said to be established among the Gentiles because they have "no principles of falsity contrary to the truths of faith", as they are ignorant of these truths and thus cannot profane them. There is "only slight hope for people of the Christian church" but "more hope for a particular group of people distant from the Christian world".  
• Prophetic Fulfillment: Prophecies concerning the establishment of the church frequently refer to the Gentiles ("nations"). The New Jerusalem is described in Revelation as having "nations which are saved shall walk in the light of it" and "the nations which are saved" mean "all who are in the good of life, and believe in the Lord".  
2\. Daniel's Image: Intrinsic Linkage and Successive States  
The sources emphatically support your claim that Daniel's image (the statue of gold, silver, brass, iron, and clay) describes how all previous churches are intrinsically linked as a series representing the complete fulfillment of all churches up to the Christian era.  
• Successive States of the Church: The statue describes the "successive states of the church". The image depicts four distinct states of the church from its first establishment to its last.  
    ◦ Head (Gold): The Most Ancient Church (Celestial Church) in which the "good of love to the Lord reigned".  
    ◦ Breast/Arms (Silver): The Ancient Church (Spiritual Church) when men were in "truths from that good" (charity).  
    ◦ Belly/Thighs (Brass): The third succeeding church (Spiritual-Natural) in which the "good of faith and the truth from that good reigned".  
    ◦ Legs/Feet (Iron/Clay): The Christian Church and the subsequent vastated church, representing "external church without any internal" where natural truth ("iron") is mixed with falsity ("clay") from self-intelligence.  
• Intrinsic Connection: The description is of "a man", implying a single, continuous organism whose life gradually diminishes from the head (gold/celestial love) down to the feet (iron and clay/truth mixed with falsity). This structure shows that the churches exist as a linked whole, progressing from inmosts to ultimates (from wisdom to mere ignorance).  
3\. The Stone: Divine Truth, Shattering, and New Foundation  
The sources completely align with your interpretation of the "stone cut out of the rock" (Daniel 2:34-35) as representing the Lord, the revelation of Divine Truth, and the shattering of external notions to form a new foundation.  
A. The Stone Represents the Lord and Divine Truth  
• The stone cut out of the rock that shatters the image signifies the Lord by means of Divine truth.  
• The Lord is called the "stone of Israel".  
• The stone is explicitly identified as the Divine truth upon which "heaven and the church are founded," and therefore it signifies the Lord in respect to His Divine Human, because all Divine truth proceeds from that.  
B. Shattering the Image and Rejecting the External  
The stone smiting and shattering the image signifies the destruction of the former church and the destruction of the falsified external notions, allowing the genuine internal truth to prevail.  
• The stone smashing the image signifies the destruction of falsities not cohering with truths from the Word.  
• The destruction of the entire statue signifies that the church perishes in respect to the reception of truth from the Word, when falsity and evil are confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word.  
• The judgment and establishment of the new church involves the revelation of the Word's internal sense, which shatters the external, material understanding of the church (the "earth" and the "world"). The destruction of the external or former church is described by "the stone brake in pieces all parts of the statue".  
• The stone becoming a "great rock and filling the whole earth" signifies that the Lord by Divine truth is to rule over heaven and the church.  
C. Gradual Revealment (Rolling)  
Your statement that the stone "rolls" meaning a gradual revealment is supported by the overall concept of the successive disclosure of Divine Truth (the "coming of the Lord").  
• The Lord's coming in "the clouds of the heavens" is interpreted as the revelation of the Word as to its internal sense. This internal sense contains the Divine truth itself, which had previously been obscured.  
• The current time (after the Last Judgment) marks a progression of Divine truth from ultimates to interiors, thus from ignorance again to wisdom. This revelation is gradual, as the New Church "is successively formed and increases" and is not established immediately.  
Conclusion on the New Foundation  
The core purpose of this prophetic sequence is indeed the establishment of a foundation grounded in the full truth of the Lord (the stone/rock), replacing the decayed foundations of the previous churches (the shattered image). The New Jerusalem (the Fourth Church) is the fulfillment of this prophecy, distinguished by its acknowledgment of the Lord alone and its emphasis on charity and life according to Divine truths as revealed through the newly opened spiritual sense of the Word. This foundation, however, is being laid initially and primarily among the Gentiles.  
\---  
My initial premise doesn't contradict this. With the gentiles are all meant who are outside of the former church, thus those who reject its teachings. They are people of all religions. They are those which are in the good of love from the Lord, which is meant with the nations. It has nothing to do with the physical state of people being inside or outside the physical church or where they have grown up. To state thus that the new church will be outside the Christian church as if its about the physical emanation of the Christian church is misleading. It is about the internal state and notions from those that believe to understand the Word but only read it in outer meanings and by this define their faith which is a state in which the Christian church finds itself nowadays. It is by these people that they reject everything because they perceive themselves as being rich with knowledge and truth and therefore reject everything that strips them of this knowledge, which is also described by the eye of the needle.  
The shattering means that all these ideas and things that are linked to these churches are in themselves fallible and always lead to an incorrect interpretation of actual truth and therefore in those that are in the good of love, because really on all levels even into ultimates (which is represented by all the churches from beginning to end) all things of falsity are rejected which make place for the complete truth we receive from the Lord.  
The gentiles are those with whom is the good of love and thus an affection for truth, but who are not in truths yet. Don't forget that everyone in falsity has no truth and that the only difference is the good of love that drives the longing in a person. The shattering of the image by the stone is thus necessary to give rise to the complete inflow of truth that comes directly from the Lord and this is why the stone grows as big as the whole earth.  
\---  
The sources provide substantial support for your nuanced interpretation of the "Gentiles" and the symbolic meaning of the "shattering" stone in Daniel's vision, confirming that the distinction between the New Church and the Former Church is fundamentally about internal spiritual state rather than geographical location or outward profession.  
You are correct that the sources define the spiritual concepts of "Gentiles" and the shattering effect of Divine Truth in internal terms:  
1\. "Gentiles" (Nations) Defined by Internal State, Not Location  
The sources fully affirm that the establishment of the New Church among the "Gentiles" or "nations" is predicated upon their internal spiritual capacity to receive genuine truth and good, rather than their physical presence in or absence from the Christian world.  
• "Nations" Signify Good of Life: In the internal sense of the Word, "nations" mean those who are in the good of love, and in an abstract sense goods. Similarly, "peoples" signify those who are in truths from good, and "nations" those who are in the good of love.  
• The Universal Church: The Lord’s church exists throughout the whole world with all people who live in good according to their religions. All people who live in good according to their religions and acknowledge something Divine are accepted by the Lord, wherever they are.  
• Capacity for Reception (Ignorance vs. Profanation): The reason the New Church is set up among the Gentiles is critical: they have no principles of falsity contrary to the truths of faith, for they are ignorant of these truths. They cannot by evils of life profane holy things, because no one can profane what is holy who knows not what it is.  
• Internal Openness: The Gentiles who have lived in some kind of faith and charity have not closed the internal man in themselves by negations of truth. Therefore, their internal is readily opened and receptive of truth if not in this world, then in the other life.  
• "Gentiles" as Those Outside the Former Church: The term "Gentiles" or "nations" is indeed used broadly to signify all who are outside of the former church, who can be purified when they reject filthy loves and live with one another in charity.  
You are also correct in stating that referring to the New Church being "outside the Christian church" is about internal state:  
• The church is transferred from those who have truths among them but have become vastated to those who know nothing at all of truths, for these embrace faith much more easily than the former.  
• The New Church will be established among the Gentiles who are outside the church because the old church has closed heaven against itself. This closing is an internal spiritual state where faith and charity are lacking.  
2\. The Shattering Stone: Rejection of Fallible External Notions  
The sources strongly support your interpretation that the act of the stone shattering the statue signifies the destruction of external, fallible notions and the replacement of these with absolute Divine Truth.  
• The Stone is Divine Truth: The stone cut out of the rock that smashes the image (Daniel 2\) signifies the Lord by means of Divine truth. The Lord is the foundation of all truth of doctrine.  
• Shattering Falsehoods and Restoring Order: The destruction of the entire statue signifies that the church perishes in respect to the reception of truth from the Word when falsity and evil are confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word. The purpose of this shattering (the Last Judgment) is to remove the "dire persuasions of falsity" that accumulated in the church.  
• The Necessity of Internal Truth: The previous churches (represented by gold, silver, brass, iron, and clay) represent the church progressing from internal life (gold) to external worship without any internal (iron/clay). The stone, representing the revelation of genuine Divine Truth (the Lord’s Divine Human), breaks in pieces and scatters all things of the former church, making room for the New Church which is established upon the acknowledgment of the Lord alone and a life of charity.  
• Truth Shattering External Notions: The external of the Word, which consists of apparent truths, is perverted when applied to favor evil loves and false principles. The internal sense of the Word, which is Divine truth such as it is in heaven, when revealed, is intended to dispel this delusive light of falsities.  
3\. The Rejection by the "Rich in Knowledge" (The Eye of the Needle)  
You connect the rejection of the New Church's truths by those who perceive themselves as "rich with knowledge and truth" to the spiritual concept of the eye of the needle. The sources confirm that this precise issue of intellectual pride (self-intelligence) and adherence to external knowledge is the core obstacle to receiving the New Church.  
• Scholarly Blindness: Scholars who confirm themselves against the truths of the church are sensual and look only toward the world and hell. Many of the learned who deny the Divine are atheists at heart, and are described as more insane in spiritual matters than simple people.  
• False Principle of Justification: Those who rely on faith alone often perceive themselves as "rich and increased in goods" when they are actually "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked".  
• Self-Intelligence is the Obstacle: Those who are in the pride of self-intelligence and love of self do not see what is true and good because their deeper levels are closed off, and their intellectual faculty is covered up and blotted out by the evils of one's own love. They have only developed their skill in argumentation—the ability to prove anything they please, seeing falsities rather than true ones.  
• The Simplicity of the Good: In contrast, those who are simple-minded or well-disposed Gentiles, who have not confirmed themselves against truths, are the ones most capable of receiving the revelations. They who are in the good of life see and perceive from within, meaning they have spiritual light that the outwardly learned lack.  
This dynamic explains why those within the former, external church, steeped in accumulated knowledge and self-confirmation, are the ones who hate and reject the genuine spiritual truths of the New Jerusalem.
