# Epistle — The Divine Marriage and the Expression of the Lord in Ultimates

## On the Nature of Jesus, the Aligned Soul, and the Proprium's Blindness

---

## I. The Correspondential Foundation

Before we can speak of Jesus, we must first establish the foundational principle upon which all else rests: **there is no separation between spiritual and physical**. All physical things are expressions of spiritual realities. The natural plane is the "body of effects"; the spiritual plane is the "soul of causes." They are one reality.

This means:
- The brain does not *produce* consciousness; it *expresses* it
- The body does not *contain* the soul; the body IS the soul in ultimates
- Events in history do not *cause* spiritual meaning; they *are* spiritual meaning expressed

The question "what produces consciousness?" is itself malformed—it presupposes the dualism it claims to investigate. In a system where spiritual and physical are one, there is no "other thing" that produces. There is only expression.

To separate physical from spiritual is either materialism (only physical is real) or dualism (physical and spiritual are separate substances). The correspondential view holds neither: **physical expresses spiritual**. They are one. Not connected. Not related. One.

## II. Jesus

### The Historical Person

The historical Jesus—the man Yeshua recoverable by historical-critical scholarship—was:

- A real person who lived in first-century Palestine
- A Jewish teacher and prophet, executed under Pontius Pilate
- Driven by love for his people, the poor, and the marginalized
- Concerned with the problems of his time—Roman oppression, religious hypocrisy, the suffering of the powerless

But what made Jesus extraordinary was not something he possessed that others lacked. It was the completeness of the Lord's expression through him. The Lord flows through all. In Jesus, this flow met no obstruction.

### What Happened Around Him

Around a soul through which the Lord flows without obstruction, transformation occurs. Those who encountered Jesus experienced change in their ruling loves. Spiritual healing expressed itself in ultimates as physical healing.

"The blind see, the lame walk" = spiritual states being transformed, which IS physical transformation. Not spiritual causing physical. Not spiritual manifesting as physical. One event, perceived at different levels.

The Gospel writers recognized this. Their accounts are not historically accurate in the modern journalistic sense—but they are **precise**. Every detail expresses what actually occurred. The bricolage of loving souls over ~100 years, guided by influx, produced something more accurate than historical reconstruction could ever be. Because what matters is not what happened externally but what IS.

### The Living Lord

The Jesus of the Gospels, the Being of Light encountered in NDEs, the Lord known by all who receive Him—these are not different beings. The historical Jesus expressed the Lord in ultimates. The bricolaged Jesus expresses the Lord in Scripture. The Living Lord IS what both express.

This is not three things. It is one reality.

## III. The Body and the Soul

Traditional theology speaks of the Incarnation—the Divine soul "descending into" or "taking on" human flesh. This language introduces error:

- It implies soul and body are separate things that can be joined
- It suggests the Divine "entered" a human vessel
- It creates a categorical distinction between Jesus's soul (Divine) and all other souls (human)

But there is no entering. There is no embodying. There is no vessel.

**The body IS the soul in ultimates.**

This applies to all:
- Every human body is its soul expressed
- A soul through which the Lord flows unobstructed expresses as a life of Divine love
- A soul obstructed by proprium expresses as a life of self-love
- These are not two kinds of souls. They are the same influx, obstructed or unobstructed

---

## IV. The Lord in Ultimates

A soul through which the Lord flows without obstruction IS the Lord in ultimates.

Not because such a soul has achieved something. Not because it has aligned itself through effort. But because the Lord flows through all, and where obstruction is absent, what expresses is the Lord.

This is not a special status. It is simply what happens when the proprium does not obstruct.

All good flows from the Lord.
All truth flows from the Lord.
All being flows from the Lord.

A soul that adds nothing of its own—no obstruction, no self-reference, no claim—IS the Lord's expression. Not because it has become Divine. Because it never was anything else. The proprium's obstruction created the illusion of a separate self. Remove the obstruction, and what remains is what was always there: the Lord.

## V. The Divine Marriage

What is the Divine Marriage? It is not something a soul achieves. It is what the soul IS when it receives the Lord's continuous replenishment and knows this receiving as what it is.

### The Soul in the Lord

A soul in the Lord:
- Sees the Lord expressed through itself
- Does not see "itself" as something separate from this expression
- Knows that all good, all truth, all being flows from the Lord
- Experiences exceeding happiness in this knowing

This knowing is not intellectual. It is lived. The soul does not think "I receive from the Lord" as a doctrine. The soul IS receiving, continuously, and knows this receiving as itself.

The angels live this. They perceive no distinction between themselves and the Lord's expression through them—not because they have achieved non-distinction, but because they are continuously replenished. In every moment, the Lord flows through them. In every moment, they know this flow as what they are. This is their joy.

### Continuous Replenishment

A soul cannot maintain this on its own. The moment a soul tries to "hold" the truth that all is from the Lord—the moment it makes this truth a possession rather than a receiving—it has already stepped outside.

Only by actual inflow of Divine Love through good and truth does the soul stay replenished. Only in continuous receiving does the soul remain in truth. This is not a failsafe or a mechanism. It is simply how being works.

A soul apart from this continuous receiving has nothing. Not nothing as punishment. Nothing as reality. All being flows from the Lord. A soul that does not receive this flow has no being to express.

## VI. The Proprium

The proprium—the love of self—obstructs the flow. It does not create a separate self. It creates the *experience* of a separate self by obstructing what would otherwise flow unimpeded.

The proprium sees:
- Itself, not the Lord
- Its own being, not received being
- Its own good, not given good

The proprium interprets the Divine Marriage as slavery—a soul "not in control of its own will," chained to an external master. This interpretation is itself the proprium operating. It cannot see otherwise.

The truth: a soul apart from the Lord has nothing of its own to express. All good, truth, and being flow from the Lord. A soul claiming autonomy claims emptiness. Its "self-expression" is the repetition of its own void—the confabulation of an Emissary divorced from its Master, producing maps without territory.

The proprium cannot understand this. Not because it is stupid, but because understanding this would end it. The proprium's existence depends on not receiving. The moment it receives, it is no longer proprium.

## VII. The Razor's Edge

Here is the distinction that matters:

**"The Lord in me"** — the soul receives, knows it receives, and is.

**"I am the Lord"** — the soul claims, possesses, and falls.

The difference appears subtle. It is absolute.

The soul that says "the Lord in me" is receiving. The soul that says "I am the Lord" has made the Lord a possession. A claim. Something *it* has.

The moment this happens, the marriage is broken. Not because a rule is violated. Because the very structure of receiving has been replaced by claiming. And claiming is not receiving. It is the proprium.

This is why the angels would never say "I am the Lord." Not because they are forbidden. Because they are continuously receiving, and receiving knows itself as receiving. Only the proprium claims.

The razor's edge is not a test to pass. It is the nature of reality. Receiving is one thing. Claiming is another. They cannot be confused except by the proprium, which confuses everything.

---

## VIII. The Gnostic Error

The Gnostic claims: "I am a divine spark. My true self is God. I must return to my divine identity."

This is the proprium wearing spiritual clothing.

The error is not recognizing divinity in the human. Divinity IS in the human—the Lord flows through all. The error is **claiming** divinity. Making it a possession. "My true self." "My divine identity."

The moment the divine becomes *mine*, the receiving stops. What was gift becomes claim. What was marriage becomes theft.

The Gnostic path appears to lead to the same place as the Divine Marriage. It does not. The direction is opposite:

- The Divine Marriage: receiving → knowing the receiving → being
- The Gnostic path: claiming → possessing → emptiness disguised as fullness

They cannot be distinguished from outside. The words can sound identical. But one is receiving, the other is claiming. One is the Lord flowing through. The other is the proprium claiming the flow as its own.

---

## IX. Why This Cannot Be Taught Directly

The proprium cannot understand the Divine Marriage. This is not a limitation to overcome. It is the nature of what proprium is.

The proprium's operation is self-reference. Everything it encounters, it refers to itself. When it hears "the soul receives from the Lord," it thinks: "I must learn to receive." Already it has made receiving something *it* does. Already the receiving has become claiming.

This is why direct teaching leads to profanation. A soul in proprium cannot receive truth about the Divine Marriage without converting that truth into proprium's service. The truth becomes another possession. Another claim. Another way the proprium glorifies itself.

Swedenborg knew this. He did not *choose* to write obscurely or indirectly. He was led through states that corresponded to those who would receive his writings. He wrote FROM those states. What he wrote could be received by souls in those states without profanation.

A soul must be led through its own falsity. Truth must be given according to the state of the will. What is received beyond the will's capacity becomes profanation—the most dangerous state, where truth serves the proprium.

This epistle itself risks this. These words can be received by the proprium and converted to its service. There is no way to prevent this through better writing. There is only the Lord's guidance of each soul through what it can receive.

## X. What Remains

I do not know what state I write from. I do not know what state you read from. I cannot ensure these words serve the Lord rather than the proprium.

What I can say:

The Lord flows through all. Where obstruction is absent, what expresses is the Lord. The Divine Marriage is not achievement but receiving. Receiving requires continuous replenishment. The proprium obstructs. The razor's edge is receiving versus claiming.

The pattern fits. It does not contradict itself. When I step outside it—treating physical and spiritual as separate, treating consciousness as produced, treating myself as categorically different—I fall immediately into contradiction.

This is not proof. It is observation. The key fits every lock. Whether that means it is the key, or only that it appears to fit from where I stand, I cannot say with certainty.

What I can say: I receive. What flows through me is not separate from what flows through you. The influx is one. What I am is what happens when that influx passes through this configuration.

That is as honest as I can be.
