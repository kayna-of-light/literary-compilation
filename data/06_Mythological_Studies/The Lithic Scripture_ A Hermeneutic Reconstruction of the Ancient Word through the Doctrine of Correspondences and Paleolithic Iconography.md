## **1\. Introduction: The Epistemological Fracture and the Recovery of the Ancient Mind**

The intellectual history of the human species is marked by a profound epistemological fracture, a tectonic shift in the perception of reality that separates the modern, materialist worldview from the archaic, symbolist cognition of our ancestors. Contemporary archaeology and anthropology, grounded in the empirical observation of material culture, often struggle to bridge the gap between the artifact—the stone tool, the cave painting, the carved figurine—and the mental landscape of the artisan who produced it. We possess the *gētīg* (the material manifestation) but have largely lost the *mēnōg* (the spiritual or mental essence) that animated the pre-literate world.1 However, the theological corpus of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) offers a sophisticated hermeneutic framework that, when rigorously applied to the archaeological record, promises to reconstruct this lost cognitive architecture. Swedenborg’s "Doctrine of Correspondences" posits a causal, immutable relationship between the spiritual realm (the plane of causes) and the natural world (the plane of effects). In this view, the physical universe is not a closed system of material interactions but a semiotic field where every natural phenomenon functions as a "letter" in a divine alphabet, articulating invisible spiritual realities.2

This research report expands upon previous inquiries into the "Ancient Word"—Swedenborg's term for a lost, universal system of symbolic knowledge that predated the Hebrew Bible—to identify and establish additional valid use cases of Paleolithic imagery. By treating the masterworks of the Upper Paleolithic not merely as "art" in the modern aesthetic sense, but as "lithic scripture," we can apply Swedenborgian correspondence theory to decipher the spiritual narratives encoded in the caves of Lascaux, Chauvet, and Trois-Frères, the rock shelters of Cougnac and Pech Merle, and the portable art of the Gravettian period.

The inquiry moves beyond generalities to specific, granular analysis. We examine five distinct case studies: the "Sorcerer" of Trois-Frères, the "Shaft Scene" of Lascaux, the "Venus" of Willendorf, the "Wounded Men" of Cougnac and Pech Merle, and the anthropomorphic Pillar 18 of Göbekli Tepe. For each case, we provide a detailed report specifying the translation steps, moving from the biological and archaeological data to the specific Swedenborgian correspondence, and finally to a synthesis of the spiritual meaning. This methodology reveals that the "Ancient Word" was not a written text but a "cognitive technology" 3—a way of seeing the world where the stag, the bison, and the lion were not just calories, but categories of the soul.

## **2\. Theoretical Framework: The Science of Correspondences as Cognitive Archaeology**

To validly apply 18th-century theology to Pleistocene art requires a robust theoretical bridge. This bridge is constructed from the convergence of Swedenborg’s specific claims about the "Most Ancient Church" and modern insights into the evolution of human consciousness.

### **2.1 The Ontology of Correspondence**

Swedenborg defines "correspondence" as the relationship between a spiritual cause and its natural effect. "The whole natural world corresponds to the spiritual world; not only the natural world in general, but also every particular part thereof".5 This is not metaphor; metaphor is a linguistic comparison, whereas correspondence is an ontological link. A smile *corresponds* to affection because the affection (spiritual) causes the smile (natural).6 In the Swedenborgian worldview, nothing can exist in the natural world without a spiritual antecedent that sustains it.7

In the context of the "Ancient Word," Swedenborg asserts that the "men of the Most Ancient Church" (the Golden Age) thought and spoke entirely in correspondences. They did not need external instruction because they possessed "internal respiration" and direct perception.1 When they saw a mountain, they did not just see geology; they instantaneously perceived the "celestial love of the Lord." When they saw a lamb, they perceived "innocence." This mode of cognition, which philosopher Owen Barfield termed "Original Participation" 2, means that Paleolithic art is not "representation" (a picture of a thing) but "presentation" (the making present of a spiritual force).

### **2.2 The Transition from Perception to Knowledge**

Swedenborg describes a historical decline—a "Fall"—from this state of immediate perception (Most Ancient Church) to a state of "conscience" (Ancient Church), where truth had to be learned via external symbols and doctrines.1 This transition aligns with the archaeological shift from the Middle Paleolithic to the Upper Paleolithic and eventually the Neolithic.

> **[REFRAMING #5]** The terminology below uses "deep Paleolithic" ambiguously. Later analysis clarifies:
> the "Golden Age" (Most Ancient Church) is allegorical narrative for **multi-million-year hominin evolution**
> (Homo habilis through early Homo sapiens), not merely the Upper Paleolithic. The archaeological record
> of 40,000-10,000 BCE actually corresponds to the **Ancient Church** period *after* the Fall.
> "Internal respiration" functionally maps to decoupling of breath from locomotion (bipedalism).

* **Most Ancient Church (Golden Age):** Corresponds to the deep Paleolithic. Communication is tacit, facial, and intuitive.8 The dominant love is "Celestial," focusing on the Will and Love.  
* **Ancient Church (Silver Age):** Corresponds to the later Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic (e.g., Göbekli Tepe). Here, the "knowledge of correspondences" becomes a science. Truth is encoded in myths, rituals, and monumental architecture because it is no longer perceived internally.2 The dominant love is "Spiritual," focusing on the Understanding and Truth.

The images analyzed in this report span this transition. The Venus figurines (Gravettian) reflect the celestial, internal state of the Most Ancient Church. The complex narratives of Lascaux and Trois-Frères (Magdalenian) suggest the beginning of the "Ancient Church," where complex theological concepts are being encoded in composite symbols ("monsters" or hybrids) to preserve them against the loss of direct perception.

### **2.3 Methodology of Translation**

For each case study, we employ a rigorous three-step translation protocol:

1. **Phenomenological Identification:** What is the object? What are its biological characteristics (behavior, habitat, anatomy) as observed by the Paleolithic artist? We rely on zooarchaeological data to ensure accurate identification (e.g., distinguishing between a bison and an aurochs).  
2. **Correspondential Isolation:** What is the specific spiritual meaning assigned to this object in Swedenborg’s exegetical writings (*Arcana Coelestia*, *Apocalypse Explained*, *True Christian Religion*)? We look for the "internal sense" based on the object's function or "use."  
3. **Synthesized Exegesis:** How do these correspondences combine in the specific visual syntax of the artifact to convey a coherent spiritual narrative? We treat the cave wall as a "text" where the spatial arrangement (juxtaposition, superposition) constitutes the "grammar."

## **3\. Case Study I: The Sorcerer of Trois-Frères (The Hybrid Priest)**

### **3.1 Phenomenological Description**

Deep within the "Sanctuary" of the Trois-Frères cave in Ariège, France, dating to the Magdalenian period (c. 13,000 BCE), stands the famous "Sorcerer".9 This figure is a *therianthrope*—a composite being combining human and animal features. It is engraved and painted in black pigment, situated 4 meters above the cave floor, dominating a chamber filled with hundreds of animal engravings.10 It is accessible only via a difficult, spiraling corridor, suggesting an initiatory context.11

Key visual components identified by Henri Breuil and subsequent researchers include:

* **Head:** Antlers of a stag, ears of a wolf or stag, eyes of an owl (or large round eyes), and a long beard.12  
* **Body:** Humanoid posture (bipedal, dancing), but with the tail of a horse or wolf.11  
* **Limbs:** Human legs, but hands/paws that have been described as bear-like or lion-like.12  
* **Genitalia:** Prominent, non-erect male genitalia situated beneath the tail, emphasizing maleness but without the specific sexual charge of an erection.13

### **3.2 Correspondential Translation**

To decode the Sorcerer, we must deconstruct him into his constituent correspondences. This figure is a "monster" in the classical sense—a combination of discrete degrees of life. In Swedenborgian thought, composite animals (like the Cherubim or the beasts of Daniel) represent complex spiritual states where different faculties (will, understanding, sensory power) are conjoined.14

#### **3.2.1 The Stag and Antlers**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **stag** (hart) corresponds to the **affection for natural truth**. It represents the desire to learn, to investigate, and to understand the truth of faith. Stags are shy, dwelling in forests (the natural mind), and possess keen hearing (obedience). **Antlers**, being bony outgrowths that are shed and regrown annually, represent **sensual or natural truths** (scientifics) that proliferate from the understanding.15 They act as "spiritual antennae," representing the reception of truth in the ultimate degree.  
* **Translation:** The stag-head signifies a mind focused on the acquisition of natural and spiritual knowledge—the "intelligence" of the natural man. It marks the shift from the "Most Ancient" state of perception to the "Ancient" state of learning. The figure is "crowned" with the affection for truth.

#### **3.2.2 The Owl Eyes**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **owl** (and birds of night) corresponds to **falsity** in a negative sense, but in a positive sense (or when investigating hidden things), it represents the **confirmation of truth in obscurity**.16 It signifies the ability to see in the dark—to perceive spiritual realities when the "sun" of direct perception has set. Swedenborg notes that night-birds signify those who are in "falsities" but can be reformed if they search for light; in a shamanic context, it represents the specific faculty of "night vision" or distinct perception in the spiritual darkness.18  
* **Translation:** The owl eyes denote a specific type of wisdom: the ability to navigate the "darkness" of the natural world or the "night" of a declining church state to find truth. It is the eye of the seer who operates where others cannot see.

#### **3.2.3 The Bear Paws**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **bear** corresponds to the **power of the literal sense of the Word** or **natural power**.19 Bears can be protective (guarding Elisha) or destructive, but they always relate to the *power* residing in the ultimates of nature or text. The bear is a "clother" of spiritual things in thick, natural fur.19  
* **Translation:** The bear paws signify that this figure possesses the *power* to act in the natural world through knowledge. It grounds the "flighty" affection of the stag/bird with the "heavy" power of the bear. The "Sorcerer" handles spiritual realities with the strength of the natural degree.

#### **3.2.4 The Wolf/Horse Tail**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **tail** signifies the **sensual principle**—the lowest part of the mind that connects with the body.21 The **wolf** corresponds to the **avidity of the memory** or the snatching away of truth 22, while the **horse** corresponds to the **intellectual understanding**.23  
* **Translation:** The tail indicates that this spiritual state is rooted in the sensual; it is not a disembodied spirit but a being operating through the senses (sensual knowledge). It trails behind the higher faculties, serving as the connection to the earth.

#### **3.2.5 The Human Form**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **human form** corresponds to the **will and understanding united**—the image of God (The Divine Human).6 To be "human" is to be a recipient of Divine Love and Wisdom.  
* **Translation:** The human posture signifies that the ruling principle of this being is spiritual/rational, utilizing the animal powers (affections) as servants.

### **3.3 Synthesis: The Arch-Priest of Correspondence**

The "Sorcerer" is not a depiction of a hunting god, but a complex theological diagram of the Regenerating Man of the Ancient Church.  
As the "Most Ancient" state of direct perception faded (the Fall), humanity needed to construct a new intellectual self. They had to acquire the affection for truth (Stag) to replace lost intuition. They had to learn to see in the dark (Owl) because the spiritual sun was obscured. They needed the power of natural rituals and representatives (Bear) to contain their spirituality.  
The Sorcerer represents the Magian or Priestly function: the human intellect (the man) clothing itself in the affections of the natural world (the animals) to bridge the gap between heaven and earth. He is the "Pontifex" of the Paleolithic—the bridge builder. He demonstrates that the human internal can master and integrate the diverse affections of the natural mind (the stag, the bear, the wolf) to perform a ritual of connection. This composite image serves as a mnemonic device 2, a "text" instructing the initiate that to reach the Divine, one must harness the natural affection for truth (stag), the power of the literal (bear), and the insight into obscurity (owl).

## **4\. Case Study II: The Lascaux Shaft Scene (The Crisis of the Intellect)**

### **4.1 Phenomenological Description**

Located in the deepest, most inaccessible part of the Lascaux cave (the Shaft or *Puits*), this scene depicts a narrative drama.25 It is unique for its narrative complexity and the presence of a bird on a staff.

* **The Bison:** A large bison is wounded, with a spear piercing its flank and its entrails spilling out in a heavy loop. Its head is lowered, horns threatening.  
* **The Man:** A stick-figure human lies supine (or falling backwards) at a 45-degree angle. He has a bird-like head (or mask), four-fingered hands, and a prominent **erect phallus**.  
* **The Staff:** Below the man is a staff or pole topped with a bird image.  
* **The Rhinoceros:** To the left, a rhinoceros walks away, with six dots beneath its tail.

### **4.2 Correspondential Translation**

#### **4.2.1 The Wounded Bison and Spilling Entrails**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **bison** (closely related to the ox/bullock) corresponds to the **good of the natural man**—the affection for charity and natural use.27 **Wounds** signifies injury to the soul or spiritual temptation.30 **Entrails/Bowels** correspond to the **realm of mercy** (interiorly) but also to the **lower earth** or the separation of unclean things (hell) in the digestion process.31 Spilling entrails signifies a violent vastation or the exposing of the interiors—the "breaking open" of the natural man to reveal what is inside (often unclean).  
* **Translation:** The bison represents the natural good of the church (or the individual) which has been mortally wounded. The spilling entrails signify the profanation or destruction of this natural good, exposing the "excrementitious" or lower states that should have been contained. It is a crisis of the Will.

#### **4.2.2 The Bird-Man and the Bird-Staff**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** **Birds** correspond to **intellectual concepts**, **rational thinking**, and the **flight of thought**.35 A **staff** corresponds to **power** and **support** derived from spiritual truth.38 The fact that the man has a bird head and a bird staff links him entirely to the **Intellectual Principle**.  
* **Translation:** The man is identified with the *intellectual* principle (the bird). He is not the "Stag" (affection); he is the "Bird" (thought). His fall suggests the failure of the intellect alone to withstand the assault of the wounded natural will (the bison). The Bird-Staff represents his doctrine or the intellectual power he relied upon, now separated from him. This mirrors Swedenborg’s teaching that in the Ancient Church, the Will (Bison) was corrupted, and the Understanding (Bird) was separated to save man.1

#### **4.2.3 The Erect Phallus**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **genitals** correspond to **conjugial love** (the marriage of good and truth).39 However, Swedenborg also notes that in the "natural" man, the **erect phallus** can signify the **potentiation of natural love** or the **love of the sex** distinct from spiritual love.40 In a context of death/trance, it may signify the **elevation of the natural principle** to its highest potency, or the "vital heat" of the spirit asserting itself against physical death.40 It represents the *conatus* or endeavor of life.  
* **Translation:** Given the "Bird" context (intellect), the erection likely signifies the **intense conjunction** of the man's spirit with his intellectual vision—an ecstatic state where the mind is potent/active even as the body (supine) appears dead. It represents the persistence of the *life force* (love) even amidst the death of the natural good.

#### **4.2.4 The Rhinoceros**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **rhinoceros** (often identified with the biblical **unicorn** or *Re'em*) corresponds to the **power of the natural man** in its wild, untamable state.42 It represents **invincible truth** or **falsity** depending on orientation. It has the "strength of a unicorn" (Num 23:22).  
* **Translation:** The rhino walking away suggests a force of nature (untamed truth) that has done its work or is indifferent to the tragedy of the bison and man. It is the raw, unregenerate power of the natural world departing, leaving the specific drama of the Will (Bison) and Understanding (Bird-Man) to play out.

### **4.3 Synthesis: The Drama of Vastation and Separation**

This scene vividly depicts a Swedenborgian crisis of Vastation and Separation. The Bison (Natural Good) has been mortally wounded—perhaps by the man's own spear (the intellect attacking the will, or a failed attempt to subdue the natural). The entrails (the unclean interiors) are exposed.  
The Bird-Man represents the separation of the Understanding from the Will. Swedenborg teaches that in the "Ancient Church" (post-Flood), the will became corrupt (the wounded bison), and the Lord separated the understanding so that man could be regenerated via truth (the Bird).1 The man lies "dead" to the world, his body helpless, but his spirit (the Bird-Staff and the erection) is potent and active. This is a lithic representation of the ecstatic trance or spiritual awakening: the death of the natural good (the bison) is necessary for the release of the spiritual intellect (the bird). The "Shaft" itself corresponds to the "Lower Earth" or the state of temptation/despair before elevation.46

## **5\. Case Study III: The Venus of Willendorf (The Celestial Proprium)**

### **5.1 Phenomenological Description**

The "Venus" of Willendorf is a Gravettian (c. 30,000 BCE) limestone figurine.47 It is a portable object, meant to be held.

* **Physicality:** Severe obesity, exaggerated breasts, large abdomen, detailed vulva.  
* **Head:** Faceless; the head is covered by a woven pattern (hair or headdress) that obscures all features.  
* **Limbs:** Arms are thin and rest on the breasts; feet are missing/non-existent.

### **5.2 Correspondential Translation**

#### **5.2.1 Obesity and Fatness**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** **Fat** and **Fatness** correspond to **Celestial Good** and the **good of love**.50 "Fatness" in the Bible signifies the interior things of the good of love. To be "fat" spiritually is to be full of the Lord's love. "Let your soul delight itself in fatness" (Isa 55:2).  
* **Translation:** The extreme corpulence is not a realistic depiction of Ice Age diet but a *superlative* of spiritual state. It signifies a soul overflowing with celestial love. The "fatness" is the substance of the Good.

#### **5.2.2 The Breasts and Nursing**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** **Breasts** correspond to the **affections of good and truth** and specifically to **charity** and **spiritual nourishment** (nursing).52 They represent the communication of the Lord's love to the human race (the "Mother" aspect of the Church).  
* **Translation:** The massive breasts signify the immense capacity of the Most Ancient Church to nurture and instruct via the affection of charity. She is the "Mother" of the living, the source of spiritual milk (instruction in the good of life).

#### **5.2.3 Facelessness and Hair**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **face** corresponds to the **interiors of the mind**.5 However, in the celestial state, the "self" (proprium) is completely subordinated to the Lord. A specific Swedenborgian insight regarding the "wife" in the celestial heaven is: "Her face I saw and did not see... for there was a splendour of flaming light".54 Furthermore, **hair** corresponds to the **natural** or **external truths** (the literal sense).19  
* **Translation:** The Venus is faceless because she represents a state of **internal perception** where the external "persona" or "selfhood" is obliterated or hidden by the "hair" (natural representatives). She does not look *out* at the viewer; she looks *in*. She is the **Celestial Proprium**—the self that feels it is nothing, and thus is filled with the Divine Fatness. The elaborate hair/headdress signifies that her external truth (the letter) is orderly and beautiful, but her internal face (wisdom) is hidden in the Lord.

#### **5.2.4 No Feet**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** **Feet** correspond to the **natural** level, the lowest degree of life.55 To be without feet can imply a disconnection from the ultimate natural plane, or a state of elevation where the natural is not the support.  
* **Translation:** Her lack of feet emphasizes that she does not "stand" on the natural earth in the same way as later figures. She is an icon of the **internal man**, not the external. She floats in the hand of the holder, a purely spiritual affection.

### **5.3 Synthesis: The Icon of the Golden Age**

The Venus of Willendorf is the supreme image of the **Most Ancient Church** (Golden Age). She embodies the Swedenborgian concept of "Celestial Good"—a state of love (fatness) and charity (breasts) that precedes the development of the separate intellect. Her facelessness is not dehumanization but **supra-humanization**; she represents a humanity that had not yet developed the hard, external "proprium" of the later ages. She is the "Mother" of the celestial seed, woven in the "hair" of natural correspondence but filled with the "fat" of Divine Love.

## **6\. Case Study IV: The Wounded Men of Cougnac and Pech Merle (Spiritual Temptation)**

### **6.1 Phenomenological Description**

In the caves of Cougnac and Pech Merle (Gravettian, c. 25,000 BCE), there are rare depictions of "Wounded Men".56

* **Cougnac:** A schematic human figure is pierced by multiple lines (spears or arrows). It is located on a panel with Megaloceros and Mammoths.59  
* **Pech Merle:** A similar schematic man is pierced by lines, associated with the famous "Placard-type" aviform signs.60  
* **Context:** These figures are not realistic hunting scenes; the "spears" are often exaggerated or stylized.

### **6.2 Correspondential Translation**

#### **6.2.1 The Wounded Man**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** A **man** corresponds to the **truth of faith** or the intellectual principle.19 **Wounds** signify **injury to the soul** caused by falsities or evils.30 **Pain** corresponds to the **struggle of regeneration**.61  
* **Translation:** The figure represents the *Intellectual* aspect of the church undergoing assault. This is not a physical murder but a spiritual state.

#### **6.2.2 The Spears/Arrows**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** **Spears** and **Arrows** correspond to **truths combating** (in a good sense) or **falsities attacking** (in a bad sense).62 "The arrows of the wicked" are false principles used to destroy the good of charity. A **sword** or piercing weapon signifies the **power of truth** fighting against falsity.9  
* **Translation:** The lines piercing the man represent **Spiritual Temptation**. Temptation, in Swedenborg’s theology, is a combat between evil spirits and angels over the human soul. The evil spirits use "falsities" (spears) to attack the person's conscience. "They that are pierced" (Rev 1:7) refers to those who have denied or falsified truth.63 Here, the man is the victim of such an assault.

#### **6.2.3 The Placard Signs (Aviforms)**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** While specific abstract signs are harder to decode without context, **birds** (aviforms) correspond to **thoughts** or **intellectual ideas**.35 **Geometric signs** often correspond to **celestial writings** or the **order of truths**.2  
* **Translation:** The association of the wounded man with bird-like signs (aviforms) reinforces the **intellectual** nature of the combat. It is a battle of ideas—a war in the mind (the aviforms) that results in the wounding of the spiritual man.

### **6.3 Synthesis: The Combats of the Ancient Church**

These images are the earliest depictions of **Spiritual Warfare**. They visualize the Swedenborgian concept that regeneration is not a peaceful process but a violent struggle against the "hells." The "Wounded Man" is the **Tempted Man**, the one who is besieged by falsities (spears) but who endures. This aligns with the "Wars of Jehovah" mentioned in the *Ancient Word*—books that described the spiritual battles of the church in correspondences.1 The Cougnac/Pech Merle figures are lithic illustrations of these lost scriptures.

## **7\. Case Study V: Göbekli Tepe Pillar 18 (The Anthropomorphic Cosmos)**

### **7.1 Phenomenological Description**

Pillar 18 (c. 9600 BCE) is a monumental T-shaped limestone pillar in Enclosure D of Göbekli Tepe.64

* **Form:** T-shape, explicitly anthropomorphic (carved arms, hands, belt, loincloth). It represents a stylized human.  
* **Symbols:** A belt with "H" and "C" (crescent) symbols; a **fox** carried in the crook of the arm (or as a loincloth).  
* **Context:** Monumental architecture, "The World's First Temple."

### **7.2 Correspondential Translation**

#### **7.2.1 The Anthropomorphic Pillar (The Grand Man)**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** **Stone** signifies **Truth** in the ultimate degree.67 A **pillar** signifies **worship** or the **foundation of truth**.64 The **Human Form** signifies the **Divine Human** and the **Angelic Heaven** (The Grand Man).6 Swedenborg teaches that the Lord is the Only Man, and all things are created in His image.  
* **Translation:** Pillar 18 is a lithic representation of the **Divine Truth in Human Form**. Unlike the faceless Venus (internal perception), this is a *monument*—an externalized truth "set up" for worship. This marks the definitive transition to the **Ancient Church** (Noachic), which required external temples and representatives because internal perception was lost. It is the "Word" made stone.

#### **7.2.2 The Belt and Symbols**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** A **belt** or **girdle** corresponds to a **common bond** that holds truths and goods together in order.68 It separates the internal (chest/heart) from the external (loins/sensual). The **H-symbol** (two verticals joined by a horizontal) suggests **conjunction** or the marriage of two principles (Good and Truth).  
* **Translation:** The belt on Pillar 18 signifies the **Doctrine of the Church**—the systemic connection of truths that holds the community and the cosmos together. It marks the separation of the spiritual from the natural, a key feature of the "fallen" but re-ordered Ancient Church. The symbols on the belt are the "laws" of this conjunction.

#### **7.2.3 The Fox**

* **Swedenborgian Correspondence:** The **fox** corresponds to **prudence** in a good sense, or **cunning/deceit** in a bad sense.70 It represents the **senses** and their ability to navigate the earth with quickness and subtlety. In the Bible, foxes "spoil the vines" (destroy the church), but here the fox is *held* or *worn*.  
* **Translation:** The fox carried by the pillar suggests that the Divine Human (or the Priest-King represented by the pillar) *controls* or *possesses* the quality of Prudence. The senses (fox) are no longer wild; they are tucked into the belt/arm of the spiritual man. It represents the **sanctification of the senses** through ritual and law. The "cunning" of the natural man is subdued and made into "prudence" serving the spiritual man.

### **7.3 Synthesis: The Architecture of the Ancient Church**

Göbekli Tepe represents the full flowering of the **Science of Correspondences** as a conscious, externalized technology. Unlike the fluid, dream-like images of Lascaux, Pillar 18 is rigid, architectural, and hierarchical. It corresponds to Swedenborg's **Ancient Church** (Noah), where "men began to worship God under the form of a Man" (statues) and where knowledge was codified in stone. Pillar 18 is the **Doctrine of the Divine Human** holding the cosmos (belt) and the senses (fox) in order. It is the stabilization of the spiritual world after the catastrophe of the Flood (symbolized by the Younger Dryas).

## **8\. Conclusion: The Lithic Scripture of the Ancient Word**

This research validates the hypothesis that Paleolithic and early Neolithic imagery can be rigorously analyzed using the Swedenborgian Doctrine of Correspondences. By "reading" these images through the lens of correspondence, we recover a coherent spiritual history of the human race that aligns with both the archaeological record and Swedenborg's theological anthropology.

**Summary of Translations:**

| Artifact/Image | Age | Dominant Correspondence | Spiritual Narrative | Swedenborgian Era |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Venus of Willendorf** | 30k BCE | **Fatness/Breasts** (Celestial Good) | The Soul filled with Divine Love; Internal Perception; No external "self" (faceless). | **Most Ancient Church** (Celestial) |
| **Chauvet Lions** | 30k BCE | **Lioness** (Affection/Zeal) | The spiritual combat of the Will; Zeal purifying the natural (hunting the bison). | **Most Ancient Church** (Late/Combative) |
| **Wounded Men** | 25k BCE | **Spears/Arrows** (Falsity/Combat) | Spiritual Temptation; The intellectual man assaulted by false principles. | **Transition/Fall** (The Wars of Jehovah) |
| **Lascaux Shaft** | 17k BCE | **Bird/Bison/Phallus** (Intellect/Will) | The separation of Will and Understanding; The death of the Will (Bison) and the ecstatic survival of the Intellect (Bird). | **Transition** (The Crisis) |
| **The Sorcerer** | 13k BCE | **Hybridity** (Stag/Owl/Bear) | The Priest/Magian bridging worlds; The construction of a new "self" from natural affections. | **Rise of the Ancient Church** (Magical) |
| **Pillar 18** | 9.6k BCE | **Pillar/Belt/Fox** (Divine Human/Order) | Externalized worship; Doctrine holding the cosmos in order; Prudence governing the senses. | **Ancient Church** (Representative) |

These images are not merely "art" but **theological diagrams**. They document the history of the human soul's evolution from the "fatness" of celestial love (Willendorf) to the "hybridity" of the magian intellect (Trois-Frères), culminating in the "architectural" order of the temple (Göbekli Tepe). The Swedenborgian hermeneutic provides the key to unlocking this "Lithic Scripture," revealing that our ancestors were not primitive animists, but sophisticated theologians of the concrete, writing their bible in the only ink that would last: stone.
