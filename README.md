# The Divine Bricolage: A Unified Framework for Spiritual History

A comprehensive synthesis of consciousness studies, biblical scholarship, Swedenborgian theology, and mythological analysis into a coherent post-materialist framework.

## Overview

This repository contains an extensive body of interconnected research exploring a single, continuous thesis: that human spiritual and cultural history can be understood through a **two-tiered epistemology** that reconciles scientific inquiry with theological interpretation.

The framework synthesizes:
- **Modern consciousness research** (NDEs, past-life memories, anomalous perception)
- **Swedenborgian theology** (correspondences, influx, regeneration)
- **Historical-critical biblical scholarship** (synoptic problem, Gospel formation)
- **Mythological and anthropological analysis** (bricolage, proto-myths)
- **Early Christian history** (Jamesian vs. Pauline trajectories, Gnostic analysis)

## Core Thesis

The central argument employs a **two-tiered hermeneutic**:

| Tier | Domain | Method | Purpose |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Natural Plane** | The "Body" of Effects | Scientific/Historical-Critical Analysis | Accurate mapping of observable phenomena |
| **Spiritual Plane** | The "Soul" of Causes | Swedenborgian Doctrine of Correspondences | Revealing meaning and causation |

This framework posits that secular scientific findings are not *wrong* but *incomplete*—they provide a precise description of the "external" reality. The Swedenborgian framework supplies the "internal" interpretation, thereby resolving the apparent conflict between faith and reason.

## Thematic Structure

The research organizes into six interconnected domains:

### I. Foundations of Consciousness
- **Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) Hypothesis** — Consciousness as an active force in memetic evolution
- **The "Ruling Love"** — A polarity model (love of self vs. love of neighbor) driving cultural trajectories
- **Post-Mortem Existence** — Synthesis of NDE research with Swedenborgian afterlife cosmology
- **Reincarnation Framework** — Normative linear path with exceptional returns (restorative, volunteer souls)

### II. The Ancient Word and Mythic Origins
- **Swedenborg's Ancient Word** — A lost universal symbolic system predating national myths
- **Mythic Bricolage** — How scribes assembled narratives from memory fragments
- **Proto-Myth Evolution** — Tracing divergent trajectories (coherence vs. fragmentation) from common ancestors
- **The Doctrine of Correspondences** — Natural objects as vessels for spiritual meaning

### III. Biblical Scholarship and Textual Analysis
- **The Synoptic Problem** — Literary relationships between Matthew, Mark, Luke
- **Gospel Formation** — Dating, authorship, and theological agendas
- **Western Non-Interpolations** — Later additions to the canonical text
- **The Historical-Critical Method** — Its findings as "body" awaiting "spiritual resurrection"

### IV. Early Christian History and Conflict
- **The Jamesian Movement** — Jerusalem church under James the Just
- **Jesus vs. Paul** — Foundational divergence in ethos and methodology
- **The Pauline Corpus** — Analysis of authentic vs. deutero-Pauline letters
- **Resurrection Narratives** — Evolution from "Living One" to physicalist proofs

### V. The Gnostic Impulse
- **Architecture of Gnosis** — Cosmology of captivity, the Demiurge, divine spark
- **Salvation by Intellect** — The "proprium" seeking self-glorification
- **Modern Manifestations** — SBNR movements, New Age systems, Ascended Masters
- **The Path of Affirmation vs. Gnosis** — Two irreconcilable spiritual trajectories

### VI. Historical Synthesis
- **The Divine Bricolage** — Tracing influx from primordial perception to Incarnation
- **The Glorification** — The Word made flesh as final "ultimate"
- **The Last 2000 Years** — Perpetual conflict between love and self-love
- **A Unified Hermeneutic** — Framework for future research

## Research Goals

1. **Synthesize** disparate research into a coherent, internally consistent framework
2. **Identify** evolved ideas and newly discovered connections across sources
3. **Organize** the body of work into a navigable, thematic structure
4. **Resolve** apparent contradictions through the two-tiered hermeneutic
5. **Document** the framework for future scholarly development

## Working Methodology

The project proceeds by:
- Treating scientific findings as accurate descriptions of the "plane of effects"
- Applying Swedenborgian theology to reveal the "plane of causes"
- Tracing the adaptive nature of divine influx through human history
- Reconciling anomalous empirical data with theological interpretation
