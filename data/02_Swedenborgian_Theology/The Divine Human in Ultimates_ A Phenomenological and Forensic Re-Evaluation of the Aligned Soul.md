# **The Divine Human in Ultimates: A Phenomenological and Forensic Re-Evaluation of the Aligned Soul**

## **I. Introduction: The Reality of the Aligned Person**

The figure of Jesus has historically been obscured by a forced dichotomy between the "Historical Jesus" (a secular reconstruction) and the "Christ of Faith" (a dogmatic construct). However, a rigorous synthesis of the "Divine Bricolage" framework, the "Jamesian" tradition, and the empirical phenomenology of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) reveals a third, more profound reality: the **Aligned Human**.

This investigation operates on the premise that Jesus was a real, vulnerable human soul—honest, loving, and fiercely devoted—who served the Lord not as a peer, but as a vessel. By stripping away theological assumptions and the "divinity trap" that seeks to make him a "God in a suit," we uncover a person who fought to align his will completely with the Divine. This report asserts that the "Being of Light" encountered in NDEs is the Lord Himself, who expresses Himself through the "Divine Human" reality—a reality that Jesus perfectly reflected, but which is universal and not culturally restricted to the historical figure of Jesus.

## **II. The Architecture of the Vessel: The Historical Reality of the Aligned Soul**

To understand Jesus as a "true person," we must strip away the layers of "domestication" that have protected him from the scandal of the human condition. The "Actual Jesus" was not a being of static perfection but a figure of dynamic struggle, embedded in the socio-economic and spiritual crises of his time.

### **2.1 The Socio-Economic Matrix: Jesus and the *Ebionim***

The vulnerability of the historical Jesus was not merely existential; it was acutely material. The research identifies the "Jamesian Protograph" (Proto-Luke) as preserving the earliest stratum of the Jesus tradition, rooted in the community of the *Ebionim* ("The Poor").1 This community viewed poverty not just as a lack of money, but as a spiritual reliance on the Lord in the face of oppression.

First-century Galilee was a stratified world of "Honor and Shame." While Jesus may have had the skills of a *tekton* (artisan), he voluntarily aligned himself with the *ptochos*—the destitute who have nothing.3 This was a "Theology of Reversal." The "Rich Man" in his parables is condemned for his abundance in the face of another's lack. This marks Jesus as a man who embraced the vulnerability of homelessness ("The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head") as a prerequisite for spiritual alignment, rejecting the safety net of the "System of Mammon."

### **2.2 The Rejection of Biological Privilege**

A critical component of the "Aligned Human" profile is the rejection of biological exceptionalism. The forensic reconstruction of the earliest traditions reveals a Christology that is fierce in its rejection of biological pedigree.1 In the primitive "Jamesian" narrative, there is no miraculous conception that exempts him from the human condition.

Crucially, the reconstruction excises the phrase "Is this not Joseph's son?" from the Nazareth pericope.1 This is not to deny his humanity, but to deny the *authority* of the patriarchal claim. He is not defined by his lineage—neither by a human father nor by a "biological" divine father in the physicalist sense. He stands as a man defined solely by his alignment with the Spirit. This supports a view where the human vessel is filled by the Divine through *choice* and *combat*, rather than being biologically constructed as a "demigod" in the womb.

### **2.3 The "Bedrock Facts" as Criteria of Temptation**

The "vulnerability" of the Aligned Human is further verified by re-interpreting historical facts not as dogmatic proofs, but as **Criteria of Temptation** 4:

* **The Baptism:** Jesus voluntarily submitted to John's baptism. This was the moment of **Initiation** where he accepted the "Assumed Human" nature—the collective "debris" of the fallen human psyche—to engage in spiritual combat. He could not redeem what he did not assume.  
* **The Temple Disturbance:** This was the **Shattering of the Vessel**. Jesus recognized that the external structure of religion had become an obstruction to the Divine Influx. By overturning the tables, he stood alone, vulnerable and unprotected, against the weight of tradition and empire.  
* **The Crucifixion:** This was the **Final Vastation**. It was the battlefield where the last vestiges of the "proprium" (self-preservation) were put off. The vulnerability here is absolute: a dying man, stripped of all protection, choosing to serve the Lord even in the face of total silence.

## **III. The Theological Mechanics: Correcting the Swedenborgian Error**

While Emanuel Swedenborg correctly identified the *process* of "Glorification" (the uniting of the Human and Divine), his 18th-century scientific limitations led him into a severe error regarding the *nature* of Jesus.

### **3.1 The Rejection of Biological Determinism**

Swedenborg argued that Jesus had a "soul from the Father" (Divine) and a "body from the mother" (Human), based on the biological theory of his time that the sire provides the soul and the dam provides the body.5 This view must be **harshly refuted**.

This "biological determinism" dehumanizes Jesus, turning him into a "God-Man" hybrid rather than a true human person. The "Aligned Human" view asserts that Jesus was a **complete human soul**. He was not the Lord *disguised* as a human; he was a human *filled* with the Lord. The difference is absolute. It means his struggles, his doubts, and his faith were real human experiences, not a divine pantomime.

### **3.2 The Proprium and the Obstruction**

The mechanism of his divinity was not biological origin, but the **removal of obstruction**. The central antagonist is the **Proprium** (Self-hood/Self-Love).6

* **The Obstruction:** The *proprium* is the "love of self" that interprets Divine Influx as its own possession ("I am powerful," "I am wise"). This blocks the flow of the Lord.  
* **The Alignment:** Jesus represents the rare, profound instance where a human soul completely silenced the *proprium*. He did not just *channel* the Lord; he became a transparency. Because there was no "self" blocking the light, the "Lord in Ultimates" could shine through him perfectly.

## **IV. Forensic Analysis of Recorded Statements: The Testimony of the Vessel**

Does the text support this "Aligned Human" interpretation? When we analyze the self-referential statements of Jesus—setting aside later theological assumptions—we find they do not "collapse" under this view. In fact, they only make sense *through* it.

### **4.1 "I Can Do Nothing on My Own"**

The most powerful testimony to the "Channel" hypothesis is found in Jesus's own admission of powerlessness:

"Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing." (John 5:19)  
"I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge... because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me." (John 5:30).

**Analysis:** If Jesus were "God" in the trinitarian or Swedenborgian sense of possessing inherent, independent omnipotence, this statement would be false or deceptive. However, for the **Aligned Human**, this is the statement of ultimate truth.

* **The Mechanism of Flow:** Jesus describes himself as a mechanism of reception. He "sees" and "hears" (Input) and then "does" and "judges" (Output).  
* **The Lack of Autonomy:** He explicitly denies autonomy ("can do nothing by himself"). This proves he viewed himself as the *servant* of the flow, not the *source*. He is the instrument that the Lord plays.

### **4.2 "Why Do You Call Me Good?"**

The rejection of the "Divine Self" is made explicit in his interaction with the rich young ruler:

*"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone."* (Mark 10:18).

**Analysis:** Orthodoxy often twists this to mean, "You must realize I am God." The Aligned Human view accepts Jesus's honesty. He refuses to appropriate "Goodness" to his human vessel. He knows that his human self (the vessel) is not the source of the Good; the **Lord** is. By deflecting the praise to the Father, he demonstrates the very act of alignment—refusing to let the *proprium* claim credit for the Divine Influx. He is "Good" only insofar as he is transparent to the Lord.

### **4.3 The Vulnerability of Gethsemane**

The struggle of the human soul is most visible in Gethsemane.

* **The Human Struggle:** The "Jamesian" and "Proto-Luke" layers remove the "angel strengthening him," leaving a Jesus who must face the darkness with his own resolve.7 This is not a "Superman" needing a recharge; it is a vulnerable soul facing the terror of death and choosing to trust.  
* **The Cry of Dereliction:** "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34). This confirms he was not "The Lord" in a mode of acting; he was a human soul experiencing **Exinanition** (Emptying).4 He felt the absence of the Divine. His victory was that he remained loyal ("My God") even when he felt abandoned.

## **V. The Phenomenology of the Being of Light: The Universal Lord and the Cultural Lens**

The user rightly distinguishes between the "Being of Light" as a universal reality and "Jesus" as a specific identification. The data supports a view where the Lord clothes Himself in the "vocabulary" of the experiencer.

### **5.1 The Being IS the Lord (Universal Reality)**

The "Being of Light" encountered in NDEs is **The Lord**—the source of unlimited Love and Truth.4 This Being is consistent across cultures in its nature (Personality), but variable in its appearance (Persona).

* **The Nature:** The core experience is of a "Person" of absolute, non-judgmental love. This is the **Divine Human**—not a specific biological man, but the nature of God as accessible, relational, and infinitely loving.  
* **The Identification:** While Western NDErs often say, "It was Jesus," this is an *interpretation* of the energy they encountered. They recognize the "Jesus quality" (radical love, acceptance) and apply the label that corresponds to that quality in their mind.

### **5.2 The Cultural Lens: Japanese vs. Western NDEs**

Cross-cultural research, particularly from Japan, validates that the identification of this Being is not exclusive to Jesus.

* **The Japanese Data:** In Japanese NDEs, experiencers often encounter a "Being of Light" or a "Figure of Light," but they rarely identify it as Jesus unless they are Christian. Instead, they may identify it as **Amida Buddha**, a respected **Ancestor**, or simply a presence of "Warmth and Light" without a name.  
* **The Correspondential Mechanism:** This proves that the image is a **Correspondence**. The Lord expresses Himself in "Ultimates" (forms) that the specific soul can receive.  
  * To a soul formed by Christian imagery, the Lord appears as **Jesus** because Jesus is the "Icon of Love" in that soul's vocabulary.  
  * To a soul formed by Buddhist imagery, the Lord appears as **Amida** (the Buddha of Infinite Light).  
  * To a secular soul, He may appear simply as **Light**.  
* **The Reality vs. The Label:** The "Being" is the same—Love, Truth, Non-Judgment without judgment—but the "Face" is chosen by the deep knowledge of the Lord to facilitate connection. It is a "User Interface" designed for the specific user.

### **5.3 The Role of the Aligned Soul**

Where does this leave Jesus?

* **The Perfect Reflection:** Jesus is not the *only* face of the Light, but he is a **True Reflection** of it. Because he achieved total alignment in his life (silencing the *proprium*), his personality became perfectly transparent to the Lord.  
* **The Universal Recognition:** When people see the "Being of Light," they are seeing the **Divine Character**. If they know Jesus, they recognize Him *in* the Light because Jesus's character was identical to the Light. But the Light is the **Lord Himself**, independent of the historical label. The "Divine Human" is the Lord's capacity to be personal with *every* human, using the cultural clay (bricolage) of their own minds to bridge the gap.

### **5.4 Forensic Conclusion**

The "Actual Jesus" was a vulnerable, honest man who claimed he could do *nothing* on his own. He refused to be called "Good" in isolation, directing all glory to the Father. He loved the Lord so deeply that he became a pure, unobstructed expression of that Love.

The "Being of Light" is the Lord. He meets us where we are, wearing the face we need. For many, that face is Jesus, and this is true because Jesus *is* that love in human form. But for others, the same Lord wears a different face. The universality of the Love proves that the Lord is not tribal; He is the Father of all, speaking every language of the human heart.

### **Table 1: The Aligned Human vs. Traditional Models**

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Origin** | Divine Soul / Human Body (Biological) | **Real Human Soul / Filled by Influx** |
| **Nature** | The Lord Himself (Direct) | **A Human Vessel *Expressing* the Lord** |
| **Power Source** | Inherent Omnipotence | **"I can do nothing on my own" (Dependent)** |
| **Being of Light** | Exclusively the Glorified Jesus | **The Lord appearing in a form the soul can receive (Jesus, Amida, Light)** |
| **Goal** | Worship of the Person | **Following the Path of Alignment (Theosis)** |
