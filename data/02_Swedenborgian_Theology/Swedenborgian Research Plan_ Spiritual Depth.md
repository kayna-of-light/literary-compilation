**Abstract:** This research plan outlines a thought experiment designed to re-evaluate the consensus findings of the historical-critical method (HCM) as applied to the canonical Gospels. By positing the metaphysical framework of Emanuel Swedenborg as an axiomatic truth, this study proposes a new hermeneutic. It argues that the HCM, with its inherent methodological naturalism, functions as an unwitting science of the *external sense* of the Gospels, meticulously documenting the natural effects of spiritual causes. The plan will demonstrate how key scholarly conclusions—such as the Gospels' genre as *bioi*, the solutions to the Synoptic Problem (Markan Priority, Q), and the criteria for reconstructing the "historical Jesus"—can be re-interpreted through Swedenborgian doctrines of Correspondence, Influx, and the Glorification of the Divine Human. This synthesis transforms the "critic" from an instrument that reveals an "absence of spiritual depth" into a tool that provides the empirical foundation for its discovery, revealing a profound and coherent spiritual reality underlying the biblical text.

## **Part I: The Doctrine of Correspondence and the Nature of the Critical Method**

This foundational section establishes the new epistemological rules of the thought experiment. It reframes the core principles of the historical-critical method (HCM) not as flawed or hostile, but as a precise description of how reality appears to the "natural mind" when it is disconnected from the "spiritual mind." The objective is to demonstrate that the method's conclusions, far from disproving a spiritual dimension, are the predictable and necessary outcome of observing spiritual reality from a purely naturalistic vantage point.

### **1.1 The Critic as the "Natural Mind": Re-interpreting Methodological Naturalism**

The historical-critical method, born of the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and empirical evaluation, fundamentally altered the study of scripture by treating the Bible as a collection of human compositions subject to the same analytical standards as any other ancient text. Its operational framework rests on several key tenets, articulated by thinkers like Ernst Troeltsch, which define the nature of its inquiry. These include the Principle of Criticism, which posits that all historical knowledge is probabilistic; the Principle of Correlation, which holds that all events are interconnected within a mundane web of cause and effect; and, most consequentially, the Principle of Analogy, which asserts that the past must be understood by assuming it is analogous to the present world of common experience.  
These principles logically culminate in a framework of "methodological naturalism," a procedural boundary that brackets out supernatural explanations in favor of natural, human-centered ones. This approach is not necessarily a metaphysical denial of the supernatural, but for the purpose of historical reconstruction, it renders events like miracles historically inaccessible or highly improbable.  
Within the axiomatic framework of this study, this methodological stance is a perfect analogue for the functioning of what Emanuel Swedenborg describes as the "external" or "natural mind". According to Swedenborg, the human mind is composed of discrete degrees: an internal, spiritual mind and an external, natural mind. The natural mind is that which is connected to the physical world through the senses; its thought is based on the data of this world, which are effects and appearances. When operating on its own, without illumination from the spiritual mind, it is incapable of perceiving spiritual causes directly. Therefore, the conclusions it reaches about reality will, by definition, be naturalistic.  
The synthesis of these two concepts reveals that the HCM's methodological naturalism is not a philosophical error to be refuted, but the *predictable result* of applying a specific cognitive faculty—the natural mind—to a multi-layered reality. The "absence of spiritual depth" that the HCM finds in the Gospels is not a property of the text itself, but a direct reflection of the method's own inherent limitations, which mirror the limitations of the natural mind. The critic, in this new form, becomes an instrument that perfectly maps the contours of reality as it appears to the external person.

### **1.2 Expanding the Principle of Analogy with the Doctrine of Correspondences**

The HCM's Principle of Analogy is its most powerful and restrictive tenet. By insisting that past events can only be understood if they are analogous to present, verifiable experiences, it creates a closed system of natural causation that methodologically excludes unique, supernatural events. This principle is the primary reason why miracles and the resurrection are deemed "historically inaccessible."  
This thought experiment proposes not to discard the Principle of Analogy, but to expand it according to Swedenborg's primary law of reality: the Doctrine of Correspondences. This doctrine states that the entire natural world is an effect that corresponds to a cause in the spiritual world. Every physical object, from the sun in the sky to a tree on the ground, has a spiritual correspondent; the sun's heat corresponds to Divine Love, and its light corresponds to Divine Wisdom. The relationship is not merely symbolic but one of cause and effect; nothing can exist in the natural world without a spiritual cause that brings it into being and sustains it.  
Therefore, the primary and most fundamental analogy is not the horizontal one between past natural events and present natural events, but the vertical one between the entire natural plane (effects) and the spiritual plane (causes). A miracle, in this expanded framework, is no longer a violation of natural law. Instead, it is a particularly direct and potent manifestation of spiritual law on the natural plane—an event where the spiritual cause becomes unusually visible in its natural effect. The HCM, by observing only the effect, correctly notes its lack of a *natural* antecedent, but it is blind to the *spiritual* cause that is its true origin. The critic's observation of an anomaly is correct; its conclusion about the anomaly's impossibility is a product of its limited, horizontal perspective.

### **1.3 The Gospel Genre (*Bioi*) as the Perfect "Ultimate" Vessel**

After decades of debate, a dominant scholarly consensus now identifies the canonical Gospels as a sub-genre of Greco-Roman biography, known as *bioi*. Unlike modern biographies, ancient *bioi* were not primarily concerned with chronological precision or exhaustive detail. Their goal was didactic: to portray the essential character of an exemplary individual through a selective collection of deeds and sayings. This genre afforded authors significant freedom to arrange material thematically, paraphrase speeches, and shape their narratives to serve rhetorical and theological purposes.  
This scholarly conclusion, reached through rigorous literary analysis, is accepted here as an accurate description of the Gospels' external form. However, within the Swedenborgian framework, this literary genre is not a mere human convention. It is the *providentially selected vessel* perfectly suited to contain the spiritual sense of the Word. According to Swedenborg, Divine Truth, to have power and presence in the world, requires an "ultimate"—a physical, literal container that can ground it. The literal sense of the Word is described as the "basis, the containant, and the support of its spiritual and celestial senses".  
The very features of the *bios* genre that historical critics identify—its flexibility in chronology and arrangement—are precisely what make it the ideal ultimate. This flexibility allows the literal narrative to be ordered not according to mundane history, but according to the higher laws of spiritual correspondence. The authors' "theological shaping" is the natural-level description of Divine Providence guiding their work to construct a literal text that serves as a stable, coherent, and perfect foundation for its internal meaning.  
This leads to a re-evaluation of the entire historical-critical project. The HCM emerged from the Enlightenment as a tool to apply reason to the Bible, effectively removing it from the exclusive domain of faith-based interpretation and positioning itself as a critic of traditional theology. Swedenborg's system, however, posits that the literal sense must be understood and established before the spiritual sense can be revealed. Over the past two centuries, the HCM has done nothing but exhaustively analyze this literal, external sense—its historical context, literary forms, source relationships, and compositional layers. Thus, the HCM has unintentionally performed the exact preparatory work necessary for a Swedenborgian hermeneutic to be applied. It has meticulously prepared the "body" of the text for the infusion of its "soul." The critic, in attempting to dissect the corpse, has instead made it perfectly ready for its spiritual resurrection. The historical relationship between criticism and faith is thereby transformed from one of opposition to one of sequential, providential necessity.  
The following table provides a clear codex for this re-interpretation, translating the language of the HCM into the language of the Swedenborgian framework that undergirds this research plan.

| Table 1: A Comparative Epistemological Framework |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **HCM Principle** | **Description within HCM Framework** | **Re-interpretation via Swedenborgian Axiom** |
| Principle of Analogy | The past is understood via analogy to the present natural world. | The natural world is understood via analogy (correspondence) to the spiritual world. |
| Methodological Naturalism | Supernatural explanations are bracketed out for the purpose of historical inquiry. | Natural phenomena are the effects of spiritual influx; the "natural mind" can only perceive the effects, not the causes. |
| Source Criticism | Seeks to identify the written sources used by the authors (e.g., Mark, Q). | Identifies the distinct streams of Divine Influx (e.g., external narrative vs. internal wisdom) that formed the Word. |
| Redaction Criticism | Authors are purposeful editors shaping sources to express their theological goals. | Authors are receptive instruments whose natural minds are guided by Divine Providence to arrange the literal sense according to the needs of the intended spiritual audience. |
| Historical Reconstruction | Aims to reconstruct "what actually happened" in the natural world. | Aims to describe the external, historical "ultimate" or effect of the Divine process of Glorification. |

## **Part II: Spiritual Influx and the Synoptic Problem**

This section applies the axiom of Spiritual Influx to the scholarly consensus on the composition of the Synoptic Gospels. The intricate literary puzzle of their interrelationship—the Synoptic Problem—is re-framed as the visible, textual trace of the divine process by which the Word was formed. The patterns of agreement and disagreement, the evidence for source documents, and the editorial choices of the authors are no longer seen as mere literary artifacts but as the natural-level evidence of a spiritual process of revelation.

### **2.1 The Evangelists as Receptive Instruments of Influx**

A firm consensus in critical scholarship holds that the Gospels were written anonymously by non-eyewitnesses who acted as compilers and editors (redactors) of earlier oral and written traditions. They were second or third-generation Christians who artfully selected, arranged, and reshaped material to present compelling portraits of Jesus for their communities.  
From the Swedenborgian perspective, this scholarly conclusion accurately describes the external reality of the authors' function. However, the underlying cause of their work is Spiritual Influx. Swedenborg teaches that all life, thought, and affection flows from the spiritual world into the natural world. Humans are fundamentally recipients of this influx, which enters their minds and shapes their thoughts and intentions. The evangelists, therefore, are not mere authors in the modern sense but are better understood as receptive instruments. Their internal states and the needs of their communities made them suitable vessels for receiving and transcribing traditions in a providentially-ordered manner. Their anonymity is spiritually significant, de-emphasizing human proprietorship and highlighting their role as conduits for a divine work. Their task was not to create but to give form to the influx of divine truth.

### **2.2 Markan Priority and the "Q" Source as Stages of Revelation**

For over a century, the dominant solution to the Synoptic Problem has been the Two-Source Hypothesis (2SH). This model is built on two pillars: Markan Priority and the existence of a hypothetical source known as "Q". Markan Priority is the widely accepted view that Mark was written first and served as a source for both Matthew and Luke. The evidence for this includes Mark's shorter length, its cruder and more primitive Greek style, and its inclusion of "harder readings" that Matthew and Luke appear to soften or omit. The Q source is a posited collection of Jesus's sayings used by Matthew and Luke to account for the approximately 230 verses they share that are not found in Mark.  
Within the thought experiment, this literary hypothesis is re-interpreted as a map of the stages of divine revelation, corresponding to the stages of human spiritual development (regeneration). Regeneration, according to Swedenborg, proceeds from external obedience to internal understanding, and finally to a life of love.

* **Markan Priority:** The Gospel of Mark, with its fast-paced narrative, focus on Jesus's deeds, "low" Christology, and "primitive" style, corresponds perfectly to the first and most external stage of spiritual life: a life of simple obedience and action-based faith. It is the necessary, foundational narrative—the body of the story—upon which deeper, more internal understanding can be built. Its literary priority is thus a reflection of its spiritual priority as the essential starting point.  
* **The "Q" Source:** The hypothetical Q, consisting primarily of sayings, parables, and wisdom teachings, corresponds to a more direct influx of *internal truth*. It represents the "understanding" or "wisdom" aspect of the Word, which flows into the mind to illuminate the will. The scholarly debate over whether Q contained a passion narrative is spiritually significant. From this new perspective, its likely lack of a passion narrative is because Q corresponds to a state of receiving wisdom *prior* to the ultimate spiritual combats (temptations) that are represented by the passion story. It is the truth that prepares one for trial, not the account of the trial itself.

### **2.3 Redaction Criticism as a Map of Spiritual Adaptation**

Building on source criticism, redaction criticism examines how Matthew and Luke altered their sources (Mark and Q) to express their own distinct theological viewpoints. Scholars meticulously track additions, omissions, and changes in wording and arrangement to uncover each evangelist's theological agenda. For example, Matthew groups much of the Q material into large, structured sermons like the Sermon on the Mount, while Luke scatters it throughout his narrative. Matthew also tends to soften Mark's "harder readings," such as changing the disciples' "no faith" to "little faith".  
This process of redaction is re-interpreted as the visible evidence of Divine Truth being providentially adapted to the receptive states of different spiritual audiences. The redactional choices are not merely the evangelists' own inventions; they are the natural-level effects of a spiritual principle: that truth is always accommodated to the recipient's capacity to understand.

* Matthew's redaction, with its strong emphasis on the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and its structured, law-giving presentation of Jesus as a new Moses, corresponds to the adaptation of Divine Truth for a mind grounded in the literal sense of the Old Testament and its correspondential system.  
* Luke's redaction, addressed to a broader Gentile audience with a focus on universal salvation for the poor and outcasts, corresponds to the adaptation of the same truth for a mind that is more rational and less bound by the specific historical correspondences of the Israelite church.

Even the persistent weaknesses of the 2SH, such as the "minor agreements" where Matthew and Luke agree in wording against Mark, can be re-interpreted. If Matthew and Luke were working independently, these agreements are hard to explain. But within a framework of influx, they can be seen as moments where the influx of internal truth (corresponding to Q) was strong enough to guide both redactors simultaneously and independently to make the same "correction" to the external narrative of Mark, bringing it into closer alignment with the internal sense.  
This re-framing also illuminates the scholarly debate itself. The competition between the Two-Source Hypothesis and its main rival, the Farrer Hypothesis (which posits that Luke used Matthew, thus eliminating Q), is not just a technical disagreement. It is a correspondential drama. The 2SH, with its clean separation of a narrative source (Mark) and a sayings source (Q), corresponds to an analytical, intellectual mind that separates action from wisdom. The Farrer hypothesis, which posits a more organic, linear development (Mark → Matthew → Luke), corresponds to a more holistic mind that sees wisdom as embedded within and flowing through the narrative tradition. The "problem" exists on the natural plane of scholarship precisely because the spiritual reality it corresponds to is a complex unity of distinct but inseparable elements: the will (action) and the understanding (wisdom).

| Table 2: Correspondential Significance of the Synoptic Data |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Synoptic Phenomenon/Hypothesis** | **Scholarly Explanation (Literary/Historical)** | **Proposed Correspondential Meaning (Spiritual)** |
| Markan Priority | Mark was written first and used as a source by Matthew and Luke. | The spiritual necessity of a foundational narrative of deeds (the external) before the reception of internal wisdom. |
| The "Q" Source | A hypothetical sayings document used by Matthew and Luke. | A direct influx of internal truth (wisdom) separate from the external narrative, corresponding to the illumination of the understanding. |
| Double Tradition | Material (mostly sayings) shared only by Matthew and Luke, attributed to Q. | Truths specific to the conjunction of the will and the understanding, forming the core of the internal spiritual life. |
| Triple Tradition | Narrative material shared by all three Synoptics, attributed to Mark. | Foundational truths related to the external life of charity and obedience, common to all initial states of regeneration. |
| Redaction of Mark's "Harder Readings" | Matthew and Luke soften theologically difficult or unflattering passages in Mark. | The process of accommodating Divine Truth to human states, moving from the starkness of apparent truth to the gentleness of genuine truth. |

## **Part III: The Divine Human and the Quest for the Historical Jesus**

This section forms the crux of the proposed research, directly engaging with the scholarly endeavor to reconstruct the figure of Jesus of Nazareth. It argues that the "historical Jesus" sought by modern scholarship is the natural, external manifestation of the Lord's internal, divine process of "Glorification." The tools and conclusions of historical Jesus research, rather than undermining the divinity of Christ, are shown to provide the very data needed to understand the nature of the Incarnation as a spiritual process with historical effects.

### **3.1 The "Historical Jesus" as the External of the "Divine Human"**

Modern academic study makes a foundational distinction between the "historical Jesus" and the "Christ of faith". The "historical Jesus" is the figure who can be reconstructed using the tools of critical history, which operate within the bounds of methodological naturalism. The "Christ of faith" is the figure of Christian theology—the divine Son of God and object of worship, whose supernatural attributes cannot be verified by historical methods.  
This scholarly distinction, far from being an error, is re-interpreted as a profound, albeit unintentional, theological insight that aligns perfectly with Swedenborg's doctrine of the Lord. According to Swedenborg, the Lord, Jesus Christ, is the "Divine Human". During His life on earth, He possessed two distinct components: an internal Divine soul, which was Jehovah Himself, and an external human nature, which was assumed from the mother, Mary. The entire purpose of His life was the process of "Glorification"—the progressive subjugation of the infirmities of the maternal human and the uniting of this human nature with His Divine soul, until they became a single, fully Divine Human.

> **[CORRECTION #2]**: This "soul from the Father / body from the mother" framing reflects 18th-century embryology. Jesus was a human being whose ruling love was oriented toward the Divine—not toward self—so the Lord flowed through him without obstruction. The proprium (self) is not removed; it is the *orientation* that matters. This is the path of regeneration any human can walk.  
The synthesis is direct and powerful:

* The **"historical Jesus"** is the external, assumed human nature. This was the part of the Lord that was visible to the world, subject to temptation, and which appeared finite and limited. It is this external aspect that is reconstructable by the "natural mind" of the HCM.  
* The **"Christ of faith"** is the internal, Divine Human—the Divine soul that was progressively manifesting itself through the external. This internal reality can only be perceived by the "spiritual mind" through the revelation contained in the Word.

The HCM's inability to "prove" the divinity of Jesus is therefore axiomatic and expected. It is akin to a biologist attempting to discover the nature of human consciousness by dissecting a brain; one cannot see the soul by analyzing the body. The critic's methods are perfectly suited to study the external vessel, but they are constitutionally blind to the internal life it contains.

### **3.2 The "Criteria of Authenticity" Re-interpreted as the "Criteria of Temptation"**

To sift the Gospel traditions for reliable data, scholars developed a set of "criteria of authenticity". While several criteria exist (e.g., multiple attestation, dissimilarity), the most powerful is often considered to be the **Criterion of Embarrassment**. This criterion gives high historical probability to traditions that were awkward or created theological difficulties for the early church, as it is improbable they would invent such stories. Classic examples include Jesus's baptism by John (which implied Jesus was sinful), the report that His own family thought He was "out of his mind," and His admission of ignorance concerning the timing of the final judgment.  
This criterion is transformed from a tool of historical verification into the **Criterion of Temptation**. According to Swedenborg, the process of Glorification was accomplished through temptations, which were spiritual combats against the collective power of the hells. These battles were fought from His assumed, finite human nature. During these states of intense temptation, the Lord was in a state of "exinanition" (emptying), a profound separation from His full Divine consciousness, wherein He felt only the weakness and suffering of the human nature He had assumed.  
The "embarrassing" traditions are therefore not merely awkward historical remnants; they are the most precious and authentic literal-sense records of the Lord's deepest states of spiritual combat.

* **Jesus's Baptism:** This event corresponds to His initiation into the first great temptations of His public ministry. The element of "remission of sins" is the external sign of His fully taking on the hereditary evils of mankind into His assumed human nature, not because He was sinful, but in order to engage and conquer those evils on behalf of all humanity.  
* **Family's Disbelief and Apparent Ignorance:** These are the direct external manifestations of the state of *exinanition*. When His family thought Him mad, or when He professed ignorance of the final hour, these were moments when His human consciousness was fully immersed in the spiritual struggle and temporarily separated from the divine omniscience of His internal soul. These are the most authentic markers of the Glorification process because they reveal the reality of the combat from the human side.

### **3.3 The "Bedrock Facts" as the Historical Footprints of Glorification**

Despite methodological debates, a strong scholarly consensus exists on a core biographical "frame" for Jesus's life. These "almost indisputable facts," as E.P. Sanders termed them, are affirmed by virtually all critical scholars, regardless of their religious beliefs. This bedrock framework includes the following: Jesus was a Galilean Jew, baptized by John the Baptist; He was an itinerant preacher whose central theme was the "kingdom of God"; He gathered disciples; He performed an action in the Jerusalem Temple that was perceived as a disturbance; and He was executed by crucifixion under the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate.  
These "bedrock facts" are re-interpreted as the undeniable, historical "ultimates" or effects that correspond to the key stages of the Lord's spiritual process of Glorification.

* **Baptism by John:** The historical marker of the initiation into His public temptations.  
* **Itinerant Ministry:** The external manifestation of the Divine Wisdom (His teaching) and Divine Love (His healing) flowing through His human nature as it was being progressively purified and united with the Divine.  
* **Temple Disturbance:** This corresponds to a divine judgment on the corrupted state of the existing church. The historical insight from scholars like E.P. Sanders, who argue it was a symbolic act prophesying the Temple's destruction and replacement, is correct on the external level. Spiritually, it corresponds to the truth that the old representative church had reached its end and a new church, founded on His now-glorified Divine Human, was being established.  
* **Crucifixion:** This is the ultimate "bedrock fact." It corresponds to the final and most severe temptation, the passion of the cross. Through this ultimate combat, the final vestiges of the maternal human were put off, and the complete and eternal union of His Human with His Divine was achieved, securing a final victory over the hells for the salvation of humanity.

This re-interpretation reveals that the very "failure" of the Quest for the Historical Jesus to produce a single, universally accepted portrait is, in fact, its greatest success. The Quest has generated a multiplicity of conflicting portraits—Jesus as an eschatological prophet, a Cynic philosopher, a social reformer. This is often seen as a failure of the historical method. However, from a Swedenborgian perspective, the Lord's Divine Human is infinite , and the Word that describes Him contains infinite truths. Each scholarly "portrait" is the result of a particular scholar or school elevating one facet of the Gospel data (e.g., apocalyptic sayings, wisdom teachings) above others. Each portrait is therefore a "natural mind" grasping one finite aspect of an infinite spiritual reality. The multiplicity of scholarly reconstructions is not a sign of historical failure; it is empirical evidence of the infinite complexity of the Divine Human they are attempting to describe.

## **Part IV: A New Hermeneutic: Integrating the External and Internal Senses**

This concluding section synthesizes the previous parts into a practical, integrated method for reading the Gospels. It argues that the historical-critical method and Swedenborgian exegesis are not competing systems but are, in fact, complementary disciplines. The former provides the science for understanding the body of the text, while the latter provides the science for understanding its soul.

### **4.1 The HCM as the Science of the Literal Sense**

This research plan affirms the indispensable value of the historical-critical method. The various sub-disciplines—textual, source, form, and redaction criticism—provide the stable, scientifically established *literal sense* of the Gospels. Understanding the historical context of the first century, the literary conventions of ancient biography, the relationships between the texts, and the redactional tendencies of the authors is the essential first step in any sound interpretation. Without this firm grounding in the external text, any attempt to discern a spiritual meaning would risk devolving into the kind of arbitrary and unfounded allegory that Swedenborg himself rejected, insisting that the spiritual sense must be drawn out from the literal sense according to fixed principles. The HCM, therefore, performs the crucial task of securing this foundation.

### **4.2 The Doctrine of Correspondences as the Science of the Spiritual Sense**

Once the literal sense has been firmly established through the tools of the HCM, the Doctrine of Correspondences can be applied to unlock the internal, spiritual sense. This is not an arbitrary process but a systematic one. Each element of the literal narrative—people (e.g., Peter, John), places (e.g., Galilee, Jerusalem), objects (e.g., bread, wine), actions (e.g., healing the blind, calming the storm), and even numbers (e.g., twelve disciples, three days)—is understood to have a precise spiritual correspondent. The sequence of events in the literal narrative is seen to correspond to the sequence of states in a spiritual process, which is primarily the Lord's Glorification but also, by extension, the process of human regeneration.

### **4.3 Case Study: An Integrated Reading of a Gospel Pericope**

To demonstrate this integrated method, a brief case study of the Cleansing of the Temple is proposed.

1. **HCM Analysis (The Body):** The first step is to gather the findings of critical scholarship. Source criticism notes the significant differences in the story's placement and details between John's Gospel and the Synoptic Gospels. Redaction criticism analyzes how Matthew and Luke edit Mark's account to fit their theological themes. Historical analysis, particularly the work of E.P. Sanders, concludes that the event was likely not a simple reform but a symbolic act prophesying the Temple's destruction. These findings establish the literal and historical "facts" of the text and its transmission.  
2. **Swedenborgian Analysis (The Soul):** The second step is to apply the science of correspondences. The Temple corresponds to the Church as a whole, and in the highest sense, to the Lord's Divine Human itself. The money-changers and sellers of animals correspond to those who profane holy things—the truths and goods of the church—by mixing them with self-love and love of the world.  
3. **Synthesis (The Living Word):** The integrated reading reveals a multi-layered truth. The Lord's action of driving out the merchants is the literal correspondence of a divine judgment against the profound profanation of the Jewish church at that time. The apparent historical contradiction of the event's placement is resolved. In John's more internal Gospel, placing the event at the beginning corresponds to the primary spiritual truth that the very first act of regeneration is the purification of the mind's "temple" from profane loves. In the Synoptics, placing it at the end of the ministry corresponds to the final judgment on the external church that immediately precedes the Lord's ultimate temptation of the cross. The different redactional placements are not historical errors but are providentially guided to reveal different facets of the same spiritual truth, adapted to the specific spiritual function of each Gospel.

## **Conclusion: Re-envisioning the Scholarly Enterprise**

This research plan outlines a thought experiment that transforms the relationship between critical scholarship and theology. By accepting a spiritual framework as axiomatic, the rigorously naturalistic findings of the historical-critical method are not discarded but are instead elevated and integrated. The "critic," in its new form, is no longer a force for demystification but a vital partner in a deeper, more holistic understanding of the Gospels. The HCM provides the scientific description of the "shadow" cast in the natural world of history and literature; Swedenborg's theology provides the principles of "light" by which the true form of the Divine reality casting that shadow can be understood. The perceived conflict between critical scholarship and spiritual faith is resolved not by compromise, but by assigning each to its proper and complementary domain—the external and the internal—and revealing their profound, necessary, and ultimately providential relationship.
