# Knowledge Graph - The Divine Bricolage
# A structured knowledge base with source-traced nodes and semantic connections
#
# Usage:
#   - Edit this file directly to add/update nodes
#   - Use scripts/graph_utils.py for queries and visualization
#   - All source chains should trace to original sources where possible
