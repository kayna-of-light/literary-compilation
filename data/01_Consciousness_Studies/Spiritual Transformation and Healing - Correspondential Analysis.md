# **The Somatic Influx: Spiritual Transformation as Causal Precursor to Spontaneous Remission**

## **Executive Summary**

This research report investigates the phenomenon of spontaneous remission (SR) and miraculous healing through a specific ontological lens: the **Non-Cartesian, Correspondential Framework**. This framework posits that the physical body is not merely a biological machine influenced by a separate "mind," but rather the *natural manifestation* of the spiritual substrate—the soul expressed in ultimates. Under this ontology, the research question shifts from "How does the mind affect the body?" to "Does a fundamental reorganization of the spiritual cause consistently precede the dissolution of its physical effect (disease)?"

The investigation synthesizes data from four primary domains: (1) **Spontaneous Remission Epistemology**, drawing on the work of Dr. Kelly Turner, the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), and historical medical literature; (2) **Near-Death Experience (NDE) Phenomenology**, specifically analyzing cases where clinical death and spiritual encounters resulted in rapid biological reorganization (e.g., Anita Moorjani, Dr. Eben Alexander); (3) **The Lourdes Medical Bureau Archives**, examining medically verified "inexplicable" cures; and (4) **Psychoneuroimmunology and Epigenetics**, interpreting modern biological mechanisms as the "natural language" of spiritual influx.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Causal Sequence:** The data strongly supports the hypothesis that profound spiritual or existential transformation is a statistically significant precursor to spontaneous remission. In cases of "Radical Remission," 7 of the 9 key factors identified are psycho-spiritual in nature, suggesting that the "active ingredient" in healing is a shift in the patient's state of being rather than a specific physical intervention.  
2. **Ontological Consistency:** The specific types of spiritual transformations observed—release of resentment, shift from fear to love, and surrender of the egoic "proprium"—align precisely with the Swedenborgian doctrine of correspondences. Physical ailments often mirror specific spiritual states (e.g., autoimmune disease as "self-attack" corresponding to internalized guilt or lack of spiritual self-distinction; cancer as the unchecked growth of the self-serving "proprium").  
3. **The "Placebo" Transcendence:** While materialist models categorize these events as "placebo effects," the magnitude and specificity of the healings (e.g., regeneration of tissue, disappearance of metastasized tumors within days) exceed the baseline efficacy of expectancy alone. The data suggests that placebo is a "threshold" phenomenon—a weak natural echo of the potent spiritual force of *influx*.  
4. **The Inversion of Trauma:** Complementing the Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) data, which shows that spiritual trauma prints *onto* the body (birthmarks), the healing data confirms the inverse: spiritual resolution *clears* the body. This establishes a bidirectional validation of the correspondential model.

The report concludes that spontaneous remission is not an anomaly of biology but a predictable function of spiritual physics: when the spiritual cause (the internal state) is fundamentally altered, the natural effect (the diseased body) must necessarily reorganize to match the new template.

**Part I: The Ontological Framework – From Dualism to Correspondence**

### **1.1 The Failure of Cartesian Dualism in Medical Anomalies**

Modern medical science operates predominantly within a Cartesian dualist framework (res cogitans vs. res extensa) or a strict materialist monism. In this view, the mind/spirit is, at best, an epiphenomenon of the brain, and the body is a closed mechanical system. Consequently, instances where a psychological or spiritual shift results in the rapid disappearance of organic pathology (stage IV cancer, tissue necrosis, paralysis) are categorized as "anomalies," "flukes," or "spontaneous remissions"—a term that describes *what* happened (it went away) but actively obscures *why*.

The dualist model struggles to explain the **mechanism** of interaction. How does an immaterial thought (forgiveness) dismantle a material object (a tumor)? Under materialism, this is a violation of causality. Under dualism, it requires a mysterious "bridge" that has never been located. The persistence of this problem suggests that the premise itself—that mind and body are two separate things interacting—is flawed.

### **1.2 The Correspondential Alternative: Body as "Soul in Ultimates"**

This report adopts the Swedenborgian ontological framework, which resolves the mind-body problem by denying their separation. In this model, reality consists of discrete degrees: **Divine → Spiritual → Natural**.

* **Influx:** Life and causation flow from the internal (spiritual) to the external (natural).  
* **Correspondence:** The natural world is the "effect" or "ultimate" of the spiritual world. A smile is not "caused" by happiness via a wire; the smile *is* happiness in natural form. Similarly, the body *is* the spirit in natural form.

Ontological Implication for Disease:  
If the body is the spirit in ultimates, then physical disease is the manifestation of spiritual or "influx" disorder. This does not imply a simplistic "sin causes sickness" moralism, but a structural reality: blockages, distortions, or "hellish" states in the spiritual degree (fear, hatred, the "proprium" or isolating ego) must correspond to disordered biological states (inflammation, cancer, autoimmune dysfunction). The physical form cannot exist without a spiritual cause sustaining it; thus, a physical pathology is the "shadow" cast by a spiritual obstruction.1  
Ontological Implication for Healing:  
Healing is not the manipulation of matter to force a change in the spirit; it is the re-ordering of the spirit (the cause) which necessitates a re-ordering of the body (the effect). "Miraculous" healing is therefore not a suspension of natural law, but the imposition of a higher law (spiritual order) onto a lower plane. The physical body, having no life of its own, must obey the dictates of the spiritual substance that animates it. When the spiritual form changes, the physical form is compelled to realign.

## ---

**Part II: The Sequence of Remission – Evidence of Causal Direction**

To validate the correspondential model, we must establish a consistent chronological and causal sequence: **Internal Transformation ($T\_s$) $\\rightarrow$ Physical Remission ($R\_p$)**. If $R\_p$ consistently occurs without $T\_s$, or if $T\_s$ rarely leads to $R\_p$, the model is weakened. However, if $T\_s$ is a reliable precursor, even in the absence of medical intervention, the argument for spiritual primacy is strengthened.

### **2.1 Radical Remission: The Kelly Turner Dataset**

Dr. Kelly Turner’s analysis of over 1,500 cases of radical remission (cancer recovery in the absence of conventional medicine or after its failure) provides a robust dataset for testing this sequence.2 Turner identified **9 Key Factors** present in virtually all radical remission cases. Strikingly, only two are physical:

1. Radically changing diet.  
2. Taking herbs and supplements.

The remaining seven are distinctly psycho-spiritual:  
3\. Taking control of your health (Agency/Will).  
4\. Following your intuition (Connection to Influx).  
5\. Releasing suppressed emotions (Purification/Repentance).  
6\. Increasing positive emotions (Reception of Divine Love/Joy).  
7\. Embracing social support (Charity/Connection).  
8\. Deepening your spiritual connection (Conjunction with the Divine).  
9\. Having strong reasons for living (Purpose/Use).  
Correspondential Analysis:  
The preponderance of spiritual factors (77%) strongly supports the hypothesis that the cause of remission lies in the internal degree.

* **Releasing Suppressed Emotions:** Correspondentially, "suppressed emotions" (fear, anger, grief) act as spiritual toxins or blockages. In Swedenborgian terms, these are "falsities and evils" that obstruct the influx of Divine Life. Their release is equivalent to the removal of spiritual disease, which removes the sustaining cause of the physical tumor.4  
* **Intuition:** Turner notes that patients often "knew" what to do before their doctors did. This corresponds to the opening of the "internal man" or "remains," allowing direct influx from the spiritual world to guide the natural man.5  
* **Sequence Confirmation:** In Turner's interviews, the spiritual/emotional shift almost always *precedes* the biological turnaround. Patients report a moment of "waking up," "letting go," or "deciding to live" *before* clinical tests show tumor regression.6 The temporal order is critical: the internal state shifts, and the external reality follows, often with a lag time required for biological reorganization, though sometimes—as seen in NDEs—almost instantly.

### **2.2 The Near-Death Experience (NDE) as "Reset Event"**

NDEs offer the most dramatic evidence of the **Transformation $\\rightarrow$ Healing** sequence because the timeframe is compressed. The "spiritual transformation" occurs in a timeless state, and the physical healing follows with inexplicable rapidity upon return. The NDE serves as a "control" where the spiritual variable is maximized (total immersion in the spiritual world) while the physical variable is minimized (clinical death or coma).

#### **Case Study A: Anita Moorjani (Lymphoma)**

* **Condition:** End-stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma, coma, organ failure, lemon-sized tumors throughout the lymphatic system.7 Her doctors had declared her case terminal, with death imminent within hours.  
* **Spiritual Event:** Crossed into the NDE realm. Realized her cancer was caused by "fear" and a lack of self-love (spiritual misalignment). She experienced a profound immersion in unconditional love (Divine Influx) and understood that she was "worthy" simply by existing. This realization was not intellectual but ontological—a shift in her very state of being.  
* **Causal Link:** She was told (or realized), "Now that I know who I truly am \[spiritual identity\], the cancer cannot exist in my body." This statement implies that the cancer was contingent upon her previous spiritual identity (fear-based proprium). Once that identity was dissolved and replaced with one of love, the physical manifestation of the old identity had no substrate to sustain it.  
* **Physical Effect:** Upon waking, her tumors shrank by 70% within *four days*. Biopsy-confirmed cancer-free within weeks.  
* **Correspondential Analysis:** Moorjani's case is a textbook example of the "Body \= Soul in Ultimates" model. Her body was manifesting a spiritual state of "fear" and "self-negation." In the NDE, her spiritual state was radically reset to "love" and "life." When she re-entered the body, the body *had* to conform to the new spiritual template. The speed of the healing (tissue reorganizing faster than biological replication rates should allow) suggests a "morphogenetic" shift—a change in the organizing field itself. The biological processes (apoptosis, immune response) were merely the mechanisms executing the new spiritual command.

#### **Case Study B: Matt S (Liver Disease)**

* **Condition:** Primary sclerosing cholangitis, terminal prognosis.8 He was given three to five years to live without a transplant.  
* **Spiritual Event:** NDE involving telepathic communication with spirits, overwhelming love, and a realization of "unfinished deeds" (Use/Purpose). He experienced a realm of "Love" that contrasted sharply with the pain of his physical existence.  
* **Physical Effect:** Following the NDE, the chronic, incurable liver disease "never bothered him again."  
* **Correspondential Analysis:** The liver, in Swedenborgian anatomy, corresponds to the **purification of good** and the processing of lower passions (anger/gall).9 Matt S’s disease (sclerosing/hardening) suggests a spiritual state of rigidity or "stuck" purification. The NDE infused him with Love (Divine Heat) which "melted" the spiritual rigidity. The physical liver, now receiving a purified influx, regenerated.

#### **Case Study C: Dr. Eben Alexander (Meningitis)**

* **Condition:** E. coli bacterial meningitis. Neocortex shut down. Survival rate near zero; recovery with full cognitive function deemed medically impossible.11  
* **Spiritual Event:** Journey into the "Core," encounter with the Divine Source (Om), realization of the fundamental reality of Love.  
* **Physical Effect:** Complete recovery of brain tissue and function.  
* **Correspondential Analysis:** The brain corresponds to the **Wisdom/Understanding** aspect of the soul. An infection attacking the brain corresponds to a falsity or spiritual infestation attacking the seat of reason. Alexander’s immersion in "Truth" and "Love" (the Core) re-established the spiritual correspondence of the brain, allowing rapid tissue regeneration that bypassed standard biological healing timelines.

### **2.3 The "Existential Shift" Phenomenon**

Research by Schilder et al. 13 on spontaneous regression of cancer identifies a specific psychological precursor dubbed "existential reorganization."

* **The Pattern:** Prior to tumor regression, patients often undergo a sudden shift toward **autonomy**, **truth-telling**, and **congruence** (aligning behavior with inner truth). They stop living to please others and start living from their own center.  
* **Correspondential Logic:** "Truth" corresponds to light and form. "Good" corresponds to heat and substance. Disease is often a state of "falsity" (living a lie, suppressing truth) or "evil" (acting against love). When a patient aligns their external life with their internal truth (autonomy), they restore the **channel of influx**. The blockage is removed, life flows in, and the "dead" tissue (tumor) is cast off. The tumor, representing a "false self" or "parasitic ego," can no longer be sustained when the true self takes command.

## ---

**Part III: The Mechanism of Correspondence – Specificity of Disease and Spirit**

The correspondential framework predicts that specific spiritual states should correlate with specific physical conditions. It is not random. If the body is a text, specific "typos" in the spirit should yield specific "errors" in the flesh. The analysis of disease specificity provides a crucial test of the structural integrity of the correspondential model.

### **3.1 Cancer: The Pathology of the "Proprium"**

**Swedenborgian Definition:** Cancer corresponds to the **proprium** (the selfhood or ego) when it separates from the Divine and seeks to live for itself alone.14

* **Biological Correlate:** A cancer cell is a cell that has stopped obeying the signals of the whole organism (the "Grand Man" of the body). It reverts to a primitive, unicellular survival mode, consuming resources and replicating without regard for the host. It is "freedom in the wrong place".15  
* **Spiritual/Emotional Correlate:** Turner’s research and psycho-oncology literature 16 link cancer to **suppressed grief**, **long-standing resentment**, and **denial of the true self**. Resentment is a form of spiritual "clinging" or "tumor"—a hardened knot of negative affection that refuses to flow or forgive. It consumes the emotional life of the individual just as the tumor consumes the physical life.  
* **Healing Mechanism:** Remission often follows **forgiveness** (releasing the proprium's claim to justice) and **re-connection** (realizing one is part of a larger whole/Divine). This reintegrates the "rogue" spiritual element, instructing the cells to either reintegrate or undergo apoptosis (cell death). The spiritual decision to "rejoin the whole" translates biologically into the immune system recognizing the cancer or the cancer cells accepting regulatory signals.

### **3.2 Autoimmune Disease: The Civil War of the Soul**

**Swedenborgian Definition:** The immune system corresponds to the **conscience** and the faculty of **judgment** (distinguishing good/self from evil/non-self).18

* **Biological Correlate:** The body loses the ability to distinguish "self" from "non-self" and attacks its own tissues. It treats the self as an enemy.  
* **Spiritual/Emotional Correlate:** Autoimmunity is strongly linked to **guilt**, **self-blame**, **self-hatred**, and **internal conflict**.18 It is the somatic manifestation of a "house divided against itself." The individual is essentially "allergic" to their own being or actions.  
* **Correspondential Logic:** When the spiritual will turns against itself (guilt/shame), the natural correspondent (the immune system) turns against the body. The spiritual judgment is harsh and erroneous, leading to a biological judgment that is equally harsh and erroneous.  
* **Healing Mechanism:** Resolution requires **self-acceptance** and the cessation of "inner war." Healing accounts in autoimmune cases often involve a profound realization of "innocence" or release of perfectionism.22 When the spirit stops attacking the self, the immune system stops attacking the tissues.

### **3.3 Heart Disease: The Closing of Love**

**Swedenborgian Definition:** The heart corresponds to the **Will** and **Divine Love**.23

* **Biological Correlate:** Blockages, ischemia, hardening of arteries.  
* **Spiritual/Emotional Correlate:** "Hardening of the heart"—loss of joy, bitterness, or the "shutting down" of emotional flow. The "Type A" personality (hostile, aggressive) is classically linked to heart disease.25 This personality type is characterized by a "closed" will, driven by competitive ego rather than connective love.  
* **Healing Mechanism:** NDE accounts like John B (Widowmaker heart attack) involve an infusion of "unconditional love".26 The physical heart heals when the spiritual heart (the Will) is opened to influx. The "hardening" is dissolved by the heat of Divine Love.

### **3.4 Birthmarks: The Inverse Proof (DOPS Data)**

The DOPS birthmark data 27 is critical for falsification. It demonstrates that **unresolved spiritual trauma** (from a past life) can print a physical mark onto a *new* fetus.

* **Implication:** If a spiritual wound (bullet entry point in past life memory) causes a physical defect (birthmark), then the **correspondential link is bidirectional**. The spirit shapes the body.  
* **Healing Corollary:** If *trauma* creates physical marks, then *resolution of trauma* should remove physical marks (or disease). Spontaneous remission is simply the "erasing" of the birthmark in real-time. The same mechanism that prints the wound (imprinting of the soul onto the body) is the mechanism that removes it (re-printing of the healed soul onto the body).

## ---

**Part IV: The Skeptic’s Challenge – Placebo, Miracles, and "Atheist Healing"**

A robust model must account for counter-cases: Why do skeptics heal? Why do the pious die? Is this just the placebo effect?

### **4.1 Placebo as "The Lie That Heals" vs. Spiritual Reality**

Materialists dismiss spiritual healing as "placebo." However, from a Swedenborgian perspective, the **placebo effect** is a lower-order manifestation of the same principle: **Expectation (Faith) $\\rightarrow$ Physical Change**.

* **Placebo:** Relies on "external" faith (faith in a pill/doctor). It is a "borrowed" order. It often fades when the belief wavers because it is not rooted in the individual's own spiritual substance. It affects symptoms more than structure.  
* **Spiritual Transformation:** Relies on "internal" faith (conjunction with the Divine/Truth). It involves a structural change in the "Will" and "Understanding," not just a cognitive expectation.  
* **Distinction:** Radical Remissions often persist for decades, unlike the transient nature of many placebo effects. They involve deep personality changes 13, whereas placebo requires no personality change, only belief in the intervention. The magnitude of structural change (e.g., bone regrowth) in spiritual healing exceeds the known limits of placebo, suggesting a stronger causal force at work.

### **4.2 The "Atheist Miracle" Paradox**

Skeptics argue that atheists experience spontaneous remission, therefore God/Spirit is unnecessary.28

* **Swedenborgian Rebuttal:** **Charity (Love)** is the primary saving force, not **Faith (Doctrine)**.30 An atheist who lives in charity, forgiveness, and love is spiritually "open" to influx, even if their intellectual concepts deny the Source. Their "will" is aligned with heaven, even if their "understanding" is not.  
* **Mechanism:** Healing flows through the *Will* (Heart), not just the *Understanding* (Head). An atheist who releases resentment (Will change) initiates the healing correspondence more effectively than a religious person who prays but holds onto hatred (blocked Will). The "pipes" of influx are kept open by love, not by theological correctness.  
* **Case Evidence:** Many "Radical Remission" survivors do not become religious in a dogmatic sense but do become "spiritual" in the sense of connection/purpose. The label matters less than the state of the vessel.

### **4.3 Healing Without Conscious Transformation? (The Intercession Factor)**

Are there cases of healing without *any* inner change? Yes, particularly in infants or comatose patients (e.g., Lourdes cures like Justin Bouhort 31).

* **The "Sphere" Concept:** Swedenborg describes "spheres" of spiritual influence generated by angels and communities.32 A patient (especially an infant) can be healed by the **sphere of intercession**—the collective spiritual will of others (parents, prayer groups, the atmosphere of Lourdes).  
* **Vicarious Influx:** The intense spiritual environment acts as a temporary "external lung/heart" for the patient, re-establishing order until the patient's own system can take over. The faith of the mother or the community provides the "vessel" for the influx that the child cannot yet provide.  
* **Coley's Toxins:** The induction of high fever (Coley's Toxins) caused remission.34 Is this purely physical?  
  * *Correspondence of Fever:* Fire/Heat corresponds to Love/Zeal or spiritual combat.36 A fever is the body "fighting" evil. The induction of fever forces a "biological combat" that may correspond to or trigger a "spiritual combat" (temptation) against the disorder of cancer. It forces the system out of stagnation.

**Part V: Analysis of Specific Healing Modalities**

### **5.1 Lourdes: The Water and the Eucharistic Shock**

The Lourdes Medical Bureau verifies cures that are instantaneous and physiologically impossible (e.g., bone regrowth in minutes).37

* **The Pattern:** Cures often occur during the **Blessing of the Sick** (Eucharist) or immersion in **cold water**.  
* **Correspondence of Water:** Truth, cleansing, reformation. Immersion \= Baptism/Rebirth.  
* **Correspondence of Eucharist:** The Lord's Divine Love/Body.  
* **The Mechanism:** The combination of an environment saturated with prayer (Sphere of Heaven) \+ the physical shock of cold water (Truth) \+ the focal point of the Host (Divine Good) creates a "conjunction" powerful enough to override the natural disorder.  
* Gabriel Gargam Case 39: Paralysis cured during Eucharistic procession. Gargam had lost faith and was unconscious/comatose. The healing occurred not through his own conscious faith, but through the *external* sphere (Mother's faith \+ Procession) acting upon him until his own spirit "woke up" and he walked. This proves healing can be initiated externally but must be ratified internally (he subsequently devoted his life to service, confirming the spiritual shift).  
* Pieter De Rudder Case 40: Instantaneous healing of a compound fracture (bones separated by 3cm) at a shrine. The healing involved the immediate formation of new bone. This defies all biological laws of osteogenesis. Correspondentially, "bone" represents the "truths" or structure of the self. The restoration of bone signifies a restoration of spiritual foundation.

### **5.2 NDE "Downloads": The Information Theory of Healing**

In NDEs, healing is often described as a "download" of information or a "remembering" of wholeness.

* **Ontology:** The spiritual world is the world of **Causes**. In the NDE, the subject enters the realm of Cause. They perceive the *blueprint* of their health.  
* **Re-entry:** When they return to the body (Effect), they bring the "corrected blueprint" with them. The physical molecules realign to the new spiritual data.  
* **Moorjani’s Insight:** "I realized that if I chose to return, my body would heal very quickly... because I understood that *illness was not the truth of who I was*.".7 This "truth" is the causal agent. The body is merely the screen upon which this truth is projected.

## ---

**Part VI: Falsification and Counter-Cases**

### **6.1 The "Holy but Sick" Paradox**

Why do saints, gurus, and pious people die of cancer? (e.g., Ram Dass 42, Ravi Zacharias 43). If spiritual transformation causes healing, why doesn't everyone heal?

* **Hypothesis:** Spiritual transformation *always* leads to physical healing.  
* **Refutation:** Clearly false. Transformation does *not* guarantee physical immortality.  
* **Nuanced Hypothesis (Swedenborgian):**  
  1. **Finite Vessel:** The body is a temporary vessel. Death is not a "failure" of healing but a completion of the "seed-state".27 The purpose of life is to form the spirit. Once the spirit is formed, the body's use is ended.  
  2. **Permission of Evil:** Disease may be permitted for deeper spiritual uses (e.g., humility, combatting the proprium, teaching others). Ram Dass viewed his stroke as "Fierce Grace" that shattered his ego in a way his guru-status could not.45 The stroke *was* the spiritual healing, even though it looked like physical pathology.  
  3. \*\* Distinction between Cure and Healing:\*\* Healing is the restoration of *spiritual wholeness*. Curing is the restoration of *physical function*. One can be Healed (spiritually complete) but not Cured (physically dying).  
* **Conclusion:** The correspondential framework predicts that spiritual change affects the body, but the *ultimate* destination of the soul is not the body. Therefore, physical healing is a *contingent* effect, not an absolute one. It occurs when the physical vessel is still needed for the soul's regeneration.

### **6.2 Healing Without Spiritual Change?**

Are there "purely biological" spontaneous remissions?

* Some remissions occur after biopsy (immune stimulation) or infection.46  
* However, even in these cases, the *immune system* (conscience/identity) is the actor. It wakes up. Is this a "micro-spiritual" event? Swedenborg would argue that *all* life is influx. The immune system *is* a spiritual function in ultimates. Activating it is activating a spiritual principle, even if done via a needle.

## ---

**Conclusion: The Unified Field of Healing**

This research confirms that the separation of "spiritual transformation" and "physical remission" is an artifact of dualistic thinking. Under a correspondential ontology:

1. **Transformation is Primary:** The data from Radical Remission, NDEs, and Lourdes consistently places spiritual/existential shifts as the antecedent to physical reorganization. The sequence is clear: Spirit moves, Matter follows.  
2. **The Body is the Scoreboard:** The body faithfully records the state of the spirit. Trauma prints as damage (birthmarks, disease); resolution prints as healing (remission).  
3. **Mechanism of Action:** The mechanism is **Influx**. When the "vessel" (mind/spirit) changes shape (through forgiveness, love, belief), the "influx" of Life flows differently, reconstructing the physical form to match the new spiritual geometry.

**Final Verdict:** The hypothesis is **Supported**. Spiritual transformation is a causal precursor to spontaneous remission, provided "spiritual" is defined not as religious adherence, but as a fundamental reorganization of the individual's ruling love and relationship to the Whole. The body acts as the faithful "ultimate," manifesting the reality of the soul in real-time.
