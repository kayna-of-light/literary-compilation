# **The Activated Covenant: Re-Interpreting Swedenborg's "Do what thou hast promised" as a Volunteer Soul's Pre-Incarnate Mission**

## **Introduction: The Delft Commission as Ontological Fulcrum**

The spiritual journey of Emanuel Swedenborg, the 18th-century Swedish scientist and polymath, pivoted on a single, transformative event. The Christophany experienced during the Easter week of April 1744 did not merely alter his perspective; it re-forged his very identity, marking his definitive transition from a man of science seeking the soul to a revelator commissioned by the Divine. At the heart of this theophany, meticulously recorded in his private *Journal of Dreams*, lies a potent command: "*Nå så giör*" ("Well, then do"), which Swedenborg immediately interpreted as "Do what thou hast promised". This report posits that this imperative transcends a simple mid-life calling. When analyzed through the "Volunteer Soul" hypothesis—a model positing that certain advanced souls may choose to incarnate for a specific mission of service—and corroborated by a modern, cross-cultural body of scientifically documented anomalous consciousness phenomena, this command can be compellingly framed as the pre-planned activation of a conscious, pre-incarnate mission agreement.  
This analysis will employ a tripartite methodology to bridge the historical account with contemporary metaphysical frameworks. First, a phenomenological exegesis will conduct a close reading of Swedenborg’s own account of the vision and its preceding spiritual crisis as documented in his *Journal of Dreams*. Second, a historical-theological analysis will situate Swedenborg’s personal interpretation within the constraints of his 18th-century Lutheran context, a paradigm that explicitly rejected concepts of pre-existence and framed divine interaction through the lens of Providence. Finally, a metaphysical synthesis will re-interpret the event using the "Volunteer Soul" model as a theoretical lens, drawing upon modern research into Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) and children's spontaneous past-life memories to provide a new explanatory context unavailable to Swedenborg himself.  
This approach does not seek to invalidate Swedenborg's own theological conclusions, such as his doctrine of Divine Providence. Instead, it offers a more detailed metaphysical mechanism for them. It suggests that for certain souls, Providence is not merely a continuous guiding hand but the temporal execution of a pre-agreed-upon blueprint. Swedenborg correctly perceived that his life had been guided from his youth toward a specific end, but his theological framework led him to attribute this guidance to a continuous external force. The Volunteer Soul model resolves the classic theological tension between divine sovereignty and human free will by positing a foundational act of free will *prior* to incarnation, reframing Providence in this context as the unfolding of the soul's own higher will in perfect alignment with the Divine. The report will thus trace the evolution of a divine command from a personal crisis to a potential paradigm for understanding mission-based incarnations.

## **Section I: The Deconstruction of the Scientist: Anatomy of a Spiritual Crisis (1743-1744)**

The Christophany of April 1744 was not an abrupt intervention into a life of placid inquiry; it was the climactic resolution of a prolonged period of intense internal trial. This state, which Swedenborg's later theology would term "vastation," was a painful but necessary purification for spiritual rebirth. For Swedenborg, this process was uniquely targeted, aimed not at correcting common moral failings but at the systematic deconstruction of his scientific ego, intellectual self-reliance, and the very rational faculties that had defined his success.

### **The Agony of "Double Thoughts"**

A distinct and distressing feature of this period was the experience of what Swedenborg called "double thoughts." He describes being in a "state of combat with double thoughts which were fighting one another," an exhausting internal war. This was not a sign of a disordered mind but a hyper-awareness of a fundamental conflict between two layers of his consciousness. In the framework of his later psychology, this represents the stark opposition between the "internal man," which is aligned with the spirit and receptive to divine influx, and the "external man," which is governed by the body, sensory input, and self-love. During his crisis, these two aspects of his being were laid bare, their struggle no longer a subtle undercurrent but a conscious and tormenting battleground within his mind. This internal friction can be understood as the conflict between the latent, pre-incarnate mission-identity and the powerful, accomplished ego of the earthly personality, Emanuel Swedenborg the scientist.

### **The Battle Against Intellectual Pride**

At the core of this crisis was an agonizing struggle against what he termed the love of self. As a celebrated figure in European science, he was acutely aware of the temptation to work for personal glory. His journal entries reveal a man systematically stripping himself of this motivation. Early in the crisis, he noted with wonder that "the impulse and self-love for my work had passed away" and that "there remained nothing of \[the desire\] to work for my own glory". Yet, the temptation was persistent. Later, he recorded the intrusive thought that "my work would have greater effect than the works of others," a notion he immediately identified as pride that he must pray for God to control.  
The specific nature of this struggle is diagnostically significant. He notes that upon arriving at The Hague, his "inclination for women, which had been my chief passion, so suddenly ceased". This suggests that his vastation was not a standard purification for a soul on a normative developmental path, but a highly specific "recalibration" of an advanced being. A Volunteer Soul, being already regenerated, would not need to form its character from scratch but would need to subordinate its already perfected natural faculties to a divine purpose. The crisis was the process of transforming his greatest asset—his peerless scientific intellect—from a tool of personal achievement into a sanctified vessel for divine revelation.

### **The Culmination in Humility**

This internal conflict plunged Swedenborg into a state of profound spiritual unworthiness. His journal is replete with confessions of his sinfulness, describing himself as "unworthy above others and the greatest of sinners". This was not mere pious rhetoric but a deep perception that his sins, rooted in intellectual pride, came from a "deeper source than in the case of many other persons". This sense of unworthiness was accompanied by severe temptations against faith itself, culminating on the very eve of his commission when he wrestled with intellectual doubt, a state where he "believed and yet did not believe". This methodological deconstruction of the scientist, forcing him to a state of abject humility and the conclusion that true faith must be received "without reasoning," was the necessary precondition for his new role as a revelator—a role predicated not on discovering truth, but on receiving it.

## **Section II: The Covenantal Imperative: A Phenomenological Analysis of the Vision (April 6-7, 1744\)**

The Christophany of the night between April 6th and 7th, 1744, was a multi-sensory, psycho-physical event that overwhelmed Swedenborg's being and established a new covenant. A phenomenological reconstruction of his own account reveals a carefully orchestrated sequence, moving from intellectual struggle to somatic takeover, and culminating in a direct, personal commission.  
The experience began not in a state of spiritual exaltation, but in one of profound intellectual doubt as he wrestled with the biblical narrative of Moses, a state that underscores the revelation's nature as an intervention that would bypass his rational mind entirely. The first manifestation was auditory and somatic. Lying in bed, he heard a "noise beneath my head" which escalated into a "booming sound as if many winds had clashed against one another." This was accompanied by a "powerful tremor, from the head and over the whole body," an indescribable force that "shook me and prostrated me on my face". This physical prostration signified a complete surrender of his own will, a temporary suspension of his personal agency. In this state, he found that the words of his prayer were not his own, but were "put into my mouth," transforming him into a vessel for the words: "Oh, Thou Almighty Jesus Christ, who of Thy great mercy deignest to come to so great a sinner, make me worthy of this grace\!".  
At this juncture, a subtle but powerful dynamic of mutual obligation was established. Swedenborg's prayer shifted from simple supplication to a covenantal appeal, reminding the Divine of His own pledge: "Thou hast promised to receive in grace all sinners; Thou canst not otherwise than keep Thy words\!". This act of holding God to His own promise created a relationship based on reciprocal fidelity. It was only after this appeal that the vision culminated. Swedenborg found himself sitting at Christ's bosom, beholding Him "face to face" with a "countenance of a holy mien... and also smiling".  
In this state of intimacy, Christ spoke the final, simple, yet all-encompassing command: "*Nå så giör*" ("Well, then do"). Swedenborg's immediate, dual interpretation—"'Love me truly,' or 'Do what thou hast promised'"—encapsulates the core of his entire subsequent project: the inseparable union of the internal life of the will (love and faith) and the external life of action (works and use). Within the framework of the Volunteer Soul, this entire event can be seen as a pre-designed ontological trigger. The "promise" is not a metaphor but a direct reference to a specific vow made in a pre-mortal state. Swedenborg's unconscious prayer was the password; Christ's command was the system's response, the activation key that unlocked the mission parameters for which his entire life had been a preparation.

## **Section III: The Promise as Providence: Swedenborg's Contemporaneous Interpretation**

As a product of 18th-century European Lutheranism, Swedenborg's intellectual and spiritual world was one in which reincarnation and pre-existence were not mainstream theological concepts; his framework was fundamentally linear and non-cyclical. While he would later depart dramatically from orthodox doctrines like salvation by faith alone (*sola fide*), this theological background shaped his initial understanding of his profound experience. Lacking a conceptual model for pre-incarnate planning, he interpreted the undeniable coherence and teleological arc of his life through the primary lens available to him: the doctrine of Divine Providence.  
He came to see that "the tenor of Divine Providence has ruled the acts of my life from my very youth... that I might finally come to the present end". His decades of exhaustive scientific study were not a personal project that was later repurposed, but a divinely guided preparation from the beginning. In this context, the "promise" was understood not as a pre-mortal agreement he had made, but as the ultimate purpose implanted in him by God and carefully guided toward fruition. The concept of Divine Providence became his best available theological vocabulary to describe what a modern framework might call a pre-incarnate life plan. He correctly identified the pattern—a life perfectly structured for a final, grand purpose—but attributed its origin to a continuous external guidance rather than a foundational internal choice.  
Furthermore, the very nature of his commission provided the experiential bedrock for his later, strenuous rejection of the prevailing Lutheran doctrine of *sola fide*. The command's unambiguous emphasis on *doing*—"Do what thou hast promised"—was in direct, existential conflict with a soteriology based on belief alone. This personal conflict, born from a direct divine encounter, forced him to construct a new theological synthesis. His entire subsequent system, with its central focus on "use" (*usus*) and the absolute inseparability of faith and charity (love in action), can be seen as the systematic resolution of the tension created in that moment in Delft. His theology is, in a profound sense, the universalization of his personal commission. The command did not just give him a mission; it gave him his core theological problem, and his life's work became the articulation of its solution.

## **Section IV: The Promise as Pre-Incarnate Agreement: A Modern Re-Interpretation**

While Swedenborg's interpretation was profound within its historical context, a modern perspective informed by decades of research into anomalous consciousness allows for a re-interpretation that is both radical and complementary. By applying the "Volunteer Soul" hypothesis as an explanatory framework, the divine command "Do what thou hast promised" shifts from a metaphor for divinely guided potential into a literal activation of a pre-incarnate covenant.

### **The Volunteer Soul as an Explanatory Framework**

The "Volunteer Soul" model, derived from a hybrid framework of post-mortem existence, posits an exceptional path of incarnation. It is distinct from the normative "seed-state" journey of spiritual formation and the "Restorative Incarnation" for souls whose development was traumatically interrupted. The key characteristic of the Volunteer Soul is that it is an advanced, already regenerated being who chooses to incarnate not for personal development, but to perform a specific mission of service. Such a soul is not returning to form its character but to use its already-formed character in service to a divine plan.

### **Echoes of the Interlife: Corroborating Evidence from Anomalous Consciousness**

This theoretical model is not purely speculative; it finds strong corroboration in modern, scientifically documented phenomena that were unavailable in Swedenborg's time. Research into Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) has yielded numerous accounts of individuals who report a pre-mortal or "interlife" existence. In this state, they describe participating in the planning of their upcoming life, which can include choosing their parents, life circumstances, and agreeing to a specific life purpose or mission, often with the assistance of spiritual guides. This data establishes a modern, empirical parallel for the concept of a pre-incarnate agreement.  
Similarly, the systematic investigation of children's spontaneous past-life memories, pioneered by Dr. Ian Stevenson, reveals a subset of cases that align with the Volunteer Soul profile. While many cases focus on the trauma of a previous violent death, others are characterized by children who express a strong, innate sense of purpose, memories of other-worldly realms, or a persistent feeling of not entirely belonging to their earthly family—all markers consistent with a mission-oriented incarnation.

### **Reframing the Commission: Swedenborg as the Archetypal Volunteer Soul**

Synthesizing these data streams allows for a powerful reframing of Swedenborg's experience as a detailed, adult account of the *activation* of such a pre-planned mission. The "promise" becomes a literal, conscious, pre-incarnate vow. The spiritual crisis is the necessary catalyst for breaking down the incarnate personality's intellectual and egoic resistance. The Christophany is the pre-arranged trigger for mission activation. Swedenborg's unique role as a "rational revelator" for the Age of Reason is no longer simply a role assigned by Providence, but the specific, pre-chosen "use" he agreed to perform.  
This interpretation is strengthened by comparing Swedenborg's commission to the archetypal prophetic calls of the Judeo-Christian tradition. As shown in the table below, while figures like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and St. Paul experienced a call that represented a radical break with or reversal of their past, Swedenborg's commission was a unique affirmation and consecration of his prior life's work. His decades of scientific study were not rendered obsolete; they were revealed to be the necessary foundation for his new task. This singular feature strongly supports the Volunteer Soul hypothesis, where the prior life's work was not a life lived in error, but the intentional, pre-planned training for the mission to come.  
**Table 1: A Comparative Typology of Prophetic Call Narratives**

| Feature | Isaiah (Isaiah 6\) | Ezekiel (Ezekiel 2-3) | St. Paul (Acts 9\) | Emanuel Swedenborg (Journal, April 1744\) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Context** | National crisis; death of King Uzziah. | Babylonian exile; national despair. | Actively persecuting the early Church. | Personal spiritual and intellectual crisis. |
| **Theophany** | Vision of God enthroned in the Temple, attended by seraphs. | Vision of the divine chariot-throne ("Merkabah"). | A blinding light from heaven. | A vision of Christ "face to face" after powerful tremors and sounds. |
| **Initial Reaction** | "Woe is me\! I am lost... a man of unclean lips." | Falls on his face. | Falls to the ground, blinded. | Prostrated on his face by an overwhelming force. |
| **Purification/Enablement** | A seraph touches his lips with a burning coal from the altar. | Commanded to eat a scroll containing God's words. | Healed of blindness by Ananias; receives the Holy Spirit. | Overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit; words are "put into his mouth." |
| **Divine Commission** | "Go and say to this people: 'Keep listening, but do not comprehend...'" | "Go, speak to the house of Israel." | "You will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have seen and heard." | "Well, then do." (Interpreted as "Do what thou hast promised.") |
| **Resulting Mission** | To prophesy judgment upon Judah. | To prophesy to the rebellious house of Israel in exile. | To be the apostle to the Gentiles. | To reveal the spiritual sense of the Word and the doctrines of a New Church. |
| **Relation to Past Life** | Radical Break | Radical Break | Reversal | Affirmation and Consecration |

This combination of NDE data, children's memory cases, and Swedenborg's adult account creates a potential "developmental map" of a Volunteer Soul's incarnation. NDEs show the pre-mortal planning phase. Children's memories show the early-life manifestation of the latent mission-identity. Swedenborg's journal provides a unique, detailed account of the mid-life *activation* of that mission in a fully developed adult. These three disparate data sets, when viewed together, form a coherent, longitudinal picture of a single, extraordinary phenomenon.

## **Conclusion: From Personal Covenant to Metaphysical Paradigm**

Re-interpreting Emanuel Swedenborg's 1744 commission through the modern lens of the Volunteer Soul hypothesis provides a more comprehensive metaphysical framework for his unique life and work. The divine command, "Do what thou hast promised," evolves from a metaphor for divinely guided potential into the literal activation of a pre-incarnate covenant. This perspective does not diminish the sanctity of Swedenborg's experience but adds a new layer of understanding, suggesting that the profound sense of purpose that defined his life was not merely bestowed upon him, but was chosen by him at a level of being that transcends earthly memory.  
The intensely personal command received in Delft became the universal doctrinal principle of his mature theology. The dual interpretation that immediately arose in his mind—"Love me truly" and "Do what thou hast promised"—became the bedrock of his core doctrine on the absolute unity of Faith and Charity. His adamant rejection of salvation by faith alone was rooted in the very nature of his own commission, which was predicated not on a passive belief but on an active *doing*. Similarly, his personal realization of a guided life—the fulfillment of "the promise"—expanded into his major theological work, *Divine Providence*, which posits that God's foresight and care govern every moment of every person's existence. Finally, the new identity he assumed in the aftermath of the vision—that of a humble "instrument" used by a higher hand —was fully realized in his public role as the author of a new revelation, signing his final magnum opus simply as a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ."  
Ultimately, the modern perspective informed by anomalous consciousness research suggests that the universal call Swedenborg articulated—to recognize one's purpose, orient one's deepest love toward the Divine, and manifest that love through a life of active, useful service—may, for some extraordinary individuals, be a mission agreed to before the journey of life even begins. It reframes the fundamental question of human existence from "Do we have a purpose?" to the far more profound inquiry: "When did we choose it?"
