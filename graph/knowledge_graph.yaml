    title: Acts 9/26 Postural Contradiction
    definition: >
      Acts 9:7 states companions were standing speechless (εἱστήκεισαν ἐνεοί)
      while Acts 26:14 explicitly states 'we had ALL fallen to the ground'
      (πάντων τε καταπεσόντων ἡμῶν) — a direct postural contradiction
      indicating narrative fluidity rather than eyewitness memory.
