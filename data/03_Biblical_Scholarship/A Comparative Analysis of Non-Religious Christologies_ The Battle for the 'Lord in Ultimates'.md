# **A Comparative Analysis of Non-Religious Christologies: The Battle for the 'Lord in Ultimates'**

## **I. Introduction: The Phenomenological Battle for the Lord**

This report conducts an in-depth analysis of a central, irreconcilable conflict within non-orthodox spiritual frameworks. This is not a "spectrum" of belief, but a spiritual conflict between two paths that, "like clay and iron, they do not mingle".  
This battle is not about religious dogma, but about the *experiential and doctrinal interpretation* of the "Lord in ultimates". The inquiry for this report is based on the framework articulated by Emanuel Swedenborg, which posits two key correspondences:

1. **The Lord as the "Sun in Heaven":** A universal, divine source of love and light from which all good and truth flows.  
2. **The "Divine Human in Jesus Christ":** The "expression of Him in ultimates," the pure, non-dogmatic, and most direct *identification* of this divine source as it is made manifest to humanity.

This analysis will map these two mutually exclusive paths:  
The first pole, the **"Path of Affirmation" (or Path of Love)**, centers on *experiential confirmation* of this correspondence. It is defined by *affective* (emotional and relational) mystical encounters with the universal "Being of Light" (the "sun in heaven") , who is then *spontaneously and purely identified* as the "Divine Human," Jesus Christ. This path is one of *reception* of truth *from* the Lord.  
The second pole, the **"Path of Gnosis" (or Path of Dismantling)**, represents the *active dismantling* of this specific, ultimate correspondence. This path, by definition, "prevent\[s\] His light from reaching you" precisely *because* it "den\[ies\] His being in ultimates". It does this by "establish\[ing\] ourselves as the prime suspects for gnosis" , thereby rejecting the Lord as the *sole source* of good and truth.  
This "Path of Gnosis" is *not* coherent in its cosmology. It is "very inconsistent" and presents "a thousand conflicting ways" to describe the divine. Its *only* coherent feature is its *consistent strategy* of dismantling the "Divine Human" correspondence through two primary tactics:

1. **Splitting the Identity:** Separating the human "Jesus" from an impersonal, universal "Christ" principle.  
2. **Changing the Name:** Explicitly replacing the ultimate identification of "Jesus Christ" with another, such as "Sananda" or "Jmmanuel".

## **II. The Path of Affirmation: The Lord as Divine Human (Jesus Christ)**

This section analyzes frameworks that align with the premise of this inquiry: the *experiential affirmation* of the "Lord as Swedenborg describes Him". This "Path of Affirmation" is defined by spontaneous, non-dogmatic encounters with the "Lord as Divine Human", who is *purely identified in ultimates* as Jesus Christ. This path is distinguished from institutional religion and is concerned only with direct, personal experience.

### **A. The NDE as Direct Phenomenological Evidence**

The most potent modern expression of the "Path of Affirmation" is found in the collected testimonies of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs). These accounts *directly* mirror the Swedenborgian correspondence:  
**1\. The "Sun in Heaven" (The Source):** The central, cross-cultural feature of NDEs is the encounter with a "very bright light". This "Being of Light" is described as an "ineffable, supreme being" radiating "unconditional, absolute, and unearned" love. This is a perfect phenomenological match for the "sun in heaven".  
**2\. The "Divine Human in Ultimates" (The Identification):** The data reveals a clear and consistent pattern of this universal "Light" being *specifically identified* as "Jesus" or "the Christ Light". Researchers report that a significant subset of NDErs who meet a divine being identify it as Jesus. Recent research on 79 NDE accounts confirms the encounter with the "Jesus personage" is a common theme in Western NDEs.  
This is *not* a religious or dogmatic identification; it is a *pure identification* that often *supersedes* religious dogma.

* **Non-Dogmatic Message:** The core message of this "Being of Light" is *never* institutional religion. It is *always* "unconditional love" and "non-judgment". The "Life Review" is described as "self-judgment in the light of absolute love". In one account, when an experiencer asked the Jesus he encountered what religion to be, he was simply told, "Follow your conscience" and "love your neighbor".  
* **Power of the Name (Anomalous Encounters):** The *power of the name* "Jesus Christ" in this spiritual-experiential context is affirmed by testimonies from those outside the Christian framework. This includes devout atheists like Gina Bonomo and Heidi Barr , Muslims like Bibi , and Hindus like Santosh , who all report an "innate knowing" and *pure identification* of this being as Jesus.

### **B. Pure Identification via Personality Match**

The consistency of this identification, even among non-believers, points to a "pure identification based on a personality match". The "Being of Light" in NDEs is not just an abstract illumination; it has a distinct, consistent, and *unique* personality. It is described as the source of "unconditional, absolute, and unearned" love , "total awareness joined with total acceptance," and is non-judgmental ("judgment had always been human. God only teaches").  
This personality is a *perfect correspondence* to the "Divine Human" as He is revealed in the Gospels—a figure who refutes the *proprium's* (self-love's) desire for an external, physical kingdom and a "struggle for power," and whose message is the universal, internal "Path of Love". Therefore, when experiencers encounter this unique personality, they are not "projecting" a cultural image. They are having a *pure encounter* with the "sun in heaven" and experiencing an "innate knowing" that this personality—this "Divine Human in ultimates"—is, and can only be, Jesus Christ.

### **C. The "Dogma Paradox" and the NDE as *Corrective***

This NDE data reveals a "Dogma Paradox": the figure identified as Jesus delivers a message of universal, unconditional love that *directly contradicts* the exclusivist "faith alone" dogma of many religious institutions. This proves the experience is *not* a projection *of* dogma; it is an experience that *corrects* dogma. It empirically supports the premise that all good and truth is *received* from the Lord and that all are "fully capable of this love" , rejecting the dogmatic "disconnect" that denies this "inflow into our very soul".

## **III. The Path of Gnosis: Dismantling the 'Divine Human' Correspondence**

This section maps the frameworks that actively work to *dismantle* the "pure identification" of the "Lord in ultimates". This "Path of Gnosis" is defined by its *cognitive* nature. This path is "very inconsistent" and its *only* coherent feature is its *consistent strategy* of denial.

### **A. Tactic 1: Splitting the Identity (The Gnostic Blueprint)**

The primary tactic is the *separation* of the fallible human "Jesus" from the divine, impersonal "Christ" aeon or principle.

* **Ancient Gnosticism:** The Valentinian Gnostic model states the divine "Savior" (the Christ aeon) descended upon the human Jesus at his baptism and *withdrew* from him before the crucifixion, leaving the human part to suffer alone. This shatters the "Divine Human" correspondence. Jesus is not the Lord, but the "saved savior" —a *model* for others to achieve gnosis.  
* **Theosophy:** This blueprint was modernized by Theosophy. Blavatsky stated that Jesus was a "philosopher and moral reformer" but separated this man from the "Christos," the *impersonal* divine principle *indwelling all humans*. Later Theosophists taught that the "Christ" was a *separate entity* (the Lord Maitreya) who "overshadowed" the adept Jesus.  
* ***The Urantia Book***: This text performs the *exact same* Gnostic "split". It *dismantles* the "Divine Human" correspondence by "splitting the divine itself". It states that the "Eternal Son" is the *actual* second person of the Trinity, but that the man Jesus was the incarnation of "Michael of Nebadon". Crucially, it claims this "Michael" is *not* the "Eternal Son" but just *one of more than 700,000* "Creator Sons".

### **B. Tactic 2: Changing the Name (The ET/Ascended Master Elaboration)**

This is the most direct assault on the "pure identification" of the "Lord in ultimates," as it explicitly *changes the name*.

* **Billy Meier (Pleiadian):** The contact notes from the Plejaren entity Semjase state that the "Lord's Prayer" was originally a meditation by **"Jmmanuel, wrongly called Jesus Christ"**. This narrative claims "Jmmanuel" was a prophet, the seventh in a line including Enoch, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Muhammad.  
* **Ascended Master Teachings / Ashtar Command:** This is the most pervasive example. In these teachings, "Master Jesus" is almost universally referred to by his "galactic name," **"Sananda"**. This "Sananda" is placed in a hierarchy (the "Great White Brotherhood") and given a job title, "Commander-in-Chief" of the Ashtar Galactic Command's flying saucer fleet.

## **IV. Analysis of "Hybrid" Systems as Sophisticated Gnosis**

The systems that appear to be "hybrids" are, upon closer inspection, more sophisticated expressions of the "Path of Gnosis". They *use* the language of the "Path of Affirmation" to deliver a Gnostic message of self-glorification, thereby "establishing ourselves as the prime suspects for gnosis".

### **A. A Course in Miracles (ACIM)**

*A Course in Miracles* is a prime example of this sophisticated Gnostic strategy.

* **Gnostic Tactic:** It *uses* the *authority* of the "Path of Affirmation" by claiming to be dictated by "Jesus himself".  
* **Gnostic Message:** It uses this authority to deliver a *purely Gnostic* message: that the world is an "illusion" of "separation" and that "Christ" is not Jesus, but the *impersonal, shared identity* of the *entire* "Sonship" (all of creation).  
* **Analysis:** This is the *exact same* Gnostic "dismantling" tactic seen in the *Gospel of Philip* ("is no longer... a Christian but is Christ" ) and in Joseph Campbell's New Age summary (the idea that "God was in Christ" is "true of *you and me as well*" ). The personal "Jesus" is used as a vehicle to teach that *we are all* the "Divine Human."

### **B. The Law of One (Ra Material)**

*The Law of One* employs a similar Gnostic tactic, using "love" as the content of its Gnosis.

* **Gnostic Tactic:** It *uses* the *language* of the "Path of Affirmation" (Love, Oneness) but *contextualizes* it within a Gnostic hierarchy of "densities".  
* **Gnostic Message:** It *dismantles* the "Divine Human" correspondence by reframing Jesus as just a "Wanderer" from the 4th density. He is merely a *teacher* of the "Law of One" , an adept of "love or understanding" , not the "Lord in ultimates".

## **V. Comparative Analysis: Coherency and Framework Refinement**

These two paths cannot be reconciled on an "axis." They are "clay and iron". A direct comparison reveals their fundamental, incompatible natures.

* **Path of Affirmation (NDE):** This path possesses high *affective and message-based* coherency. The message of unconditional love is simple, powerful, and consistent across thousands of accounts. It requires *minimal cosmological scaffolding*. Its authority is the self-validating *experience* of the "Lord as Divine Human".  
* **Path of Gnosis (Dismantling):** This path is *cosmologically incoherent* and "very inconsistent". It is an "umbrella term" for "a thousand conflicting ways". Theosophy , *Urantia* , and Ascended Master teachings present "conflicting messages" with wildly different hierarchies , reincarnation lists , and definitions. Its *only* coherent feature is its *strategy*: the consistent, unified goal of *dismantling* the "Divine Human" correspondence and "establishing ourselves as the prime suspects for gnosis".

### **Comparative Christology of Non-Religious Frameworks**

| Framework | Nature of 'Jesus' (Man) | Nature of 'Christ' (Principle) | Core Message | Mechanism of Revelation | Classification |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Near-Death Exp. (NDE)** | The "Being of Light" / Jesus | The "Christ Light" / Love Itself | Unconditional Love, Non-Judgment | Spontaneous Mystical Experience | **Path of Affirmation** |
| **Gnosticism** | Human vessel / "Saved Savior" | Divine Aeon / Gnosis | Secret Knowledge for liberation | Esoteric Texts / Secret Tradition | **Path of Gnosis (Dismantling)** |
| **Theosophy** | Adept / Master / Vehicle | Indwelling Principle / Maitreya | Esoteric Wisdom / Hierarchy | Doctrinal Texts / Clairvoyance | **Path of Gnosis (Dismantling)** |
| **Ascended Masters** | Master Jesus / **Sananda** | World Teacher / Cosmic Christ | Hierarchical Ascension / Galactic Lore | Channeled Messages | **Path of GGnosis (Dismantling)** |
| ***The Urantia Book*** | Michael of Nebadon (1 of 700,000+ Sons) | The Eternal Son (a separate being) | Cosmic Hierarchy / Life of Service | Channeled Revelation (Sealed) | **Path of Gnosis (Dismantling)** |
| ***A Course in Miracles*** | Personal Guide / First Son | **Shared Identity of Sonship** | Forgiveness / Atonement | Channeled Dictation (Jesus) | **Path of GGnosis (Sophisticated)** |
| ***The Law of One*** | 4th-Density Wanderer / Teacher | (Not a distinct principle) | The Law of One (Unity/Love) | Channeled Communication (Ra) | **Path of Gnosis (Sophisticated)** |

## **VI. Conclusion: The Incompatible Paths of Reception and Denial**

The "clay and iron" metaphor is the correct and final framework. The "Path of Affirmation" and the "Path of Gnosis" are not two different "axis points" on a "spectrum"; they are fundamentally incompatible spiritual realities.  
**The "Path of Affirmation"** is one of *reception*. It is based on the spontaneous, affective *experience* of the "Lord as Divine Human". Its authority is phenomenological, and its message is *coherent and simple*: unconditional love. This path receives good and truth *from* the Lord. The identification of the "Lord in ultimates" as "Jesus Christ" is not a "cultural projection" but a *pure identification based on a direct personality match* between the "Being of Light" and the "Divine Human" of the Gospels.  
**The "Path of Gnosis"** is one of *denial*. It is based on the *cognitive* rejection of the Lord as the *sole source* of good and truth. This path "establish\[es\] ourselves as the prime suspects for gnosis" and "prevent\[s\] His light from reaching" humanity by *denying His very "being in ultimates"*.  
This "Gnostic framework" is "very inconsistent". The data confirms it is a "cornucopia of controversy" , a collection of "conflicting messages" and "a thousand conflicting ways" —from Gnostic aeons , to Theosophical Masters , to the 700,000 Creator Sons of the *Urantia Book* , to the "Sananda" of the Ashtar fleet.  
This inconsistency is not a flaw in its system; it *is* the system. The "Path of Gnosis" is a "Babel" of conflicting cosmologies whose *only* unifying, coherent feature is its *strategy*: to dismantle the one, simple, coherent truth affirmed in the NDEs: the "Divine Human" who is "purely identified" as Jesus Christ.  
This framework also clarifies the NDE data itself. The overwhelmingly positive NDEs are not a *survey* of the general state of humanity, but are "biased towards the message" —a form of divine influx given to "guides of light" to "ignite change". The "hellish" NDEs, like Pittman's , are the *diagnosis* of the general state: a "correspondial vision" of a world dominated by the "98%" who follow the *proprium* of "faith alone" and "actively cut off the divine".
