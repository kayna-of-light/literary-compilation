**Period-by-Period Scientific & Archaeological Maps**  
Here is a chronological breakdown with maps that reflect a scientific, rather than literal, understanding of the biblical narrative.

#### **1\. Pre-Patriarchal Context (c. 6000–2000 BCE)**

This period corresponds to the settings of the primordial stories in Genesis. Scientifically, we look at paleogeography and the archaeological cultures of the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age.

* **What to look for:** Maps of settlement patterns, climate change, and early urbanism.  
* **Scientific Perspective:** Instead of a single "pre-flood" world, archaeology reveals millennia of developing cultures. A key event that profoundly shaped the region was the **4.2 kiloyear aridification event** (c. 2200 BCE), a severe drought that led to the collapse of urban cultures across the Near East. This is a scientifically documented event that provides a real-world backdrop to tales of societal collapse and migration.  
* **Representative Map:** A map from the **Digital Archaeological Atlas of the Holy Land (DAAHL)** showing the dense cluster of settlements during the Early Bronze Age II, followed by a sharp decline in the Early Bronze Age IV (also called the Intermediate Bronze Age). This visually represents the societal collapse that archaeologists have documented.

#### **2\. Middle & Late Bronze Age (c. 2000–1200 BCE) \- The World of Canaan**

This is the era corresponding to the biblical Patriarchs and the Egyptian sojourn. Archaeology provides a clear picture of Canaan as a land of competing city-states, largely under the influence of the Egyptian Empire.

* **What to look for:** Maps based on Egyptian administrative texts (like the **Amarna Letters**) and extensive archaeological surveys.  
* **Scientific Perspective:** The biblical portrayal of this era is largely anachronistic. Archaeology shows no evidence of the patriarchs as historical figures, but it richly illustrates the world described. Canaan was a collection of powerful city-states (e.g., Hazor, Megiddo, Lachish) that paid tribute to Egypt.  
* **Representative Map:** A political map of the Levant in the Late Bronze Age (c. 1400 BCE). This map would show the Egyptian province of Canaan, the Hittite Empire to the north, and the locations of major city-states mentioned in the Amarna Letters. This is based on textual and archaeological evidence, not the book of Genesis.

#### **3\. Iron Age I (c. 1200–1000 BCE) \- The Emergence of "Israel"**

This period follows the collapse of the Bronze Age empires and corresponds to the biblical books of Joshua and Judges.

* **What to look for:** Archaeological survey maps of the central hill country of Canaan.  
* **Scientific Perspective:** The biblical story of a swift, unified military conquest of Canaan under Joshua is **not supported by the archaeological record.** Instead, archaeology reveals a gradual process. Over 300 new, small, unwalled agricultural villages appear in the central highlands during this time. The scholarly consensus is that the population of these villages—the proto-Israelites—were most likely indigenous Canaanites who migrated away from the collapsing coastal city-states.  
* **Representative Map:** A map showing the distribution of Iron Age I highland settlements. It highlights their location away from the traditional Canaanite urban centers in the valleys and plains. Such a map demonstrates a demographic shift rather than an invasion.

#### **4\. Iron Age II (c. 1000–586 BCE) \- The Israelite Kingdoms**

This is the era of the biblical kings, from David and Solomon to the destruction of Jerusalem. The historicity and scale of the early monarchy is a subject of intense scholarly debate.

* **The "United Monarchy" (10th Century BCE):**  
  * **Scientific Perspective:** This is highly contested. The "minimalist" scholarly view, based on a lack of monumental architecture or writing from 10th-century Jerusalem, suggests it was likely a small tribal chiefdom, not the grand empire the Bible describes. The "maximalist" view points to findings at sites like **Khirbet Qeiyafa** as potential evidence for a centralized state. Modern maps should reflect this uncertainty.  
  * **Representative Map:** A good scholarly map will show Jerusalem as a highland polity but will use dotted lines or different colors to indicate the *hypothesized* vs. *archaeologically attested* extent of its influence. It will show a clear distinction between the small, archaeologically-verified core around Jerusalem and the much larger, legendary empire.  
* **The Divided Kingdoms of Israel and Judah (c. 930–586 BCE):**  
  * **Scientific Perspective:** The existence of these two kingdoms is well-established through archaeology and non-biblical texts (e.g., Assyrian inscriptions). The northern kingdom of **Israel**, with its capital at Samaria, was larger, wealthier, and more powerful than the southern kingdom of **Judah**.  
  * **Representative Map:** A map of the 9th-8th centuries BCE showing the defined territories of Israel and Judah, as well as their powerful neighbors: the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, the Philistine city-states, and the encroaching Neo-Assyrian Empire.

#### **5\. Persian & Hellenistic Periods (c. 539–63 BCE)**

This period covers the return from exile and the Maccabean revolt.

* **What to look for:** Maps of the Persian imperial province system and the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great.  
* **Scientific Perspective:** Archaeology and Persian administrative documents confirm that "Judah" was a small province within the Persian Empire known as **Yehud Medinata**. Later, during the Hellenistic period, the region was caught in the conflict between the Ptolemaic (Egyptian-based) and Seleucid (Syrian-based) empires.  
* **Representative Map:** Two maps are key here:  
  1. The Persian province of **Yehud**, showing its small size relative to its neighbors like Samaria.  
  2. The **Hasmonean Kingdom** under rulers like Alexander Jannaeus (c. 100 BCE), showing its dramatic expansion based on historical sources like Josephus and archaeological evidence of fortifications.

#### **6\. The Roman Period (63 BCE onward) \- The World of the New Testament**

* **What to look for:** Detailed regional maps of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria in the 1st century CE.  
* **Scientific Perspective:** Recent archaeology has transformed our understanding of 1st-century Galilee. It was not an isolated backwater, but a thriving region with large, urban centers like **Sepphoris** and **Tiberias** that were deeply integrated into the Roman economy. This provides a much richer context for the ministry of Jesus.  
* **Representative Map:** A detailed map of Galilee in the early 1st century CE. It would show the major cities, the network of Roman roads, large agricultural estates, and small villages like Nazareth and Capernaum in their proper socio-economic context. This map would be based on extensive archaeological survey data rather than just the gospel narratives.
