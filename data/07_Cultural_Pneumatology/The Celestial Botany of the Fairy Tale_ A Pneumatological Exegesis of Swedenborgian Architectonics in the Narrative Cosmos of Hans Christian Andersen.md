# **The Celestial Botany of the Fairy Tale: A Pneumatological Exegesis of Swedenborgian Architectonics in the Narrative Cosmos of Hans Christian Andersen**

## **I. Introduction: The Cartography of the Invisible in the Danish Golden Age**

The literary landscape of nineteenth-century Scandinavia was characterized by a profound and oscillating tension between the encroaching materialism of the industrial age, represented by the steam engine and the telegraph, and the lingering, luminous vapors of Romanticism, which sought the divine in the organic structure of the natural world. In Denmark, this tension crystallized in the era known as the "Golden Age" (*Den danske guldalder*), a period of extraordinary intellectual fertility roughly spanning the first half of the nineteenth century. Within this milieu, science, theology, and poetics were not disparately siloed disciplines but dialectical partners in a unified investigation of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. At the epicenter of this cultural phenomenon stood Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), a writer often relegated by subsequent generations to the nursery, yet whose work constitutes a sophisticated theological anthropology and a rigorous engagement with the metaphysical problems of his time.

Andersen’s fairy tales are not merely whimsical fictions or folk retellings; they are, upon rigorous inspection, allegorical topographies that map the traverse of the human soul through distinct planes of existence. They function as a "vernacular theology," translating complex soteriological and epistemological concepts into the grammar of the fantastic. Central to understanding the metaphysical depth of Andersen’s oeuvre is the shadow—or perhaps the illumination—of the Swedish scientist-turned-mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). Although Swedenborg died decades before Andersen’s birth, his comprehensive cosmology permeated the intellectual ether of Northern Europe, influencing figures as diverse as Balzac, Baudelaire, Blake, and Goethe.1

While the extent of Andersen’s direct, dogmatic adherence to the Church of the New Jerusalem remains a subject of biographical nuance, the **structural isomorphism** between Swedenborg’s "Heavenly Doctrines" and Andersen’s narrative mechanics is undeniable and pervasive. Andersen’s stories operate within a universe governed by specific spiritual laws that mirror Swedenborg’s system: the correspondence between the natural and spiritual worlds, the distinct stratification of reality into discrete degrees, the specific distinction between the animal and human soul, and the dynamic, evolutionary potential of the spirit to transcend its biological origins through moral action.

This report undertakes an exhaustive examination of this intertextual relationship. It posits that Andersen utilized Swedenborgian concepts—specifically the **Doctrine of Discrete Degrees**, the **Science of Correspondences**, and the **Grand Man**—as the unseen scaffolding for his most enduring narratives. By deconstructing texts such as *The Little Mermaid*, *The Snow Queen*, *The Shadow*, *The Girl Who Trod on the Loaf*, and *Ole the Tower Keeper*, we reveal a coherent theological project: the dramatization of the soul’s regeneration from the "natural" state of self-love to the "spiritual" state of charity.

### **1.1 The Vectors of Transmission: Intellectual Networks in Copenhagen**

To understand how Swedenborg’s esoteric theology infiltrated the popular fairy tale, one must examine the vectors of transmission in Andersen’s Copenhagen. Andersen was not a solitary genius working in a vacuum; he was embedded in a network of thinkers for whom Swedenborgian ideas were part of the philosophical vernacular. The "Swedenborgian" influence on Andersen was likely mediated through three primary channels:

#### **1.1.1 Hans Christian Ørsted: The Spirit in Nature**

The discoverer of electromagnetism, Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), was Andersen’s close friend, mentor, and intellectual champion.3 Ørsted was not a materialist; he was a *Naturphilosopher* deeply influenced by the Romantics and the concept of a unified cosmos. His seminal work, *The Spirit in Nature* (*Aanden i Naturen*, 1850), argued that the laws of nature are the thoughts of God and that the natural world is a manifestation of the divine mind.3 This concept is fundamentally Swedenborgian, echoing the central tenet that the natural world is a "theater" representing the spiritual world. Ørsted’s influence on Andersen was profound, encouraging him to see science and spirit as compatible, a view that mirrors Swedenborg’s own trajectory from mineralogy and anatomy to theology.4 Andersen’s enthusiasm for technology (microscopes, steam engines) alongside his mysticism is a direct inheritance from Ørsted.

#### **1.1.2 Bernhard Severin Ingemann: The Metaphysics of the Soul**

Bernhard Severin Ingemann (1789–1862), a poet and novelist, maintained a lifelong correspondence with Andersen. Ingemann was deeply engaged with questions of the soul’s immortality and the nature of the afterlife, themes that permeate his letters to Andersen.5 Their correspondence often grapples with the very "spiritual physics" that Swedenborg systematized—how the soul survives death, the nature of heavenly spheres, and the continuity of consciousness.6 Ingemann’s religious views were less orthodox than the state Lutheran church and more aligned with a mystical, progressive view of the soul’s development, providing a safe harbor for Andersen’s own heterodox explorations.

#### **1.1.3 The Cultural Ether of Romanticism**

The broader Scandinavian literary scene was saturated with Swedenborgian elements. The works of Atterbom and the Swedish Romantics, with whom Andersen was familiar, carried these themes. Furthermore, the concept of the artist as a "seer" who perceives the spiritual reality behind natural forms was a staple of the era. Andersen’s specific genius lay in applying these high-philosophical concepts to the humble, animistic world of toys, plants, and animals, thereby actualizing Swedenborg’s doctrine that the Divine is present in the "least things" as well as the greatest.7

## **II. The Architecture of Reality: Swedenborg’s Metaphysical System**

Before dissecting Andersen’s narratives, it is essential to establish the precise definitions of the Swedenborgian concepts that serve as our analytical lens. Swedenborg’s theology is not vague mysticism; it is technical, almost anatomical, in its precision, derived from his background in mining and physiology.

### **2.1 The Doctrine of Discrete Degrees**

Swedenborg argues that reality is not a continuum of finer and grosser matter, but is stratified into distinct planes of existence called **Discrete Degrees** (or degrees of height). These degrees are related by **correspondence** (cause and effect) rather than continuity.

* **The Natural Degree:** The world of space, time, and matter. This is the world of effects. It includes the physical body and the "sensual" mind which processes data from the five senses.  
* **The Spiritual Degree:** The world of thought, intellect, and wisdom. This is the realm of causes. Here, truth and falsity are the primary realities.  
* **The Celestial Degree:** The highest realm of pure love, will, and affection. This is the realm of ends (purposes).

In this system, a being cannot move from a lower degree to a higher degree merely by "improving" or refining the lower substance. A stone does not become a plant by being polished; a beast does not become a human by being trained. Transition between degrees requires a fundamental transformation, an opening of a new internal faculty.7 This is the metaphysical hurdle that drives the plot of *The Little Mermaid*.

### **2.2 The Animal Soul vs. The Human Soul**

Swedenborg draws a sharp ontological line between animals and humans based on these degrees. This distinction is critical for understanding Andersen’s hierarchy of beings.

* **The Animal Soul:** Animals are born into the full perfection of their nature. They possess "natural affections" (instincts) and a "natural soul." However, they lack the **Spiritual-Rational** degree. Their "ends" (purposes) are entirely terrestrial—survival, procreation, and physical comfort. Because they cannot elevate their understanding above their natural affections to contemplate the Divine, they do not possess immortality. Their life force (soul) dissipates or returns to the general spiritual reservoir upon death.7  
* **The Human Soul:** Humans are born "viler than beasts" (tabula rasa) but possess two unique vessels: the **Will** (to receive Divine Love) and the **Understanding** (to receive Divine Wisdom). Crucially, humans have a **Rational** faculty that can be elevated above their natural instincts. They can think *about* their desires and choose to align them with God. This capacity for conjunction with the Divine grants the human soul immortality. The human soul is a "recipient organ" of life that persists after the death of the physical body, retaining the "ruling love" acquired during life.13

### **2.3 The Science of Correspondences**

This is the semantic logic of Swedenborg’s universe. Every natural object is the physical manifestation of a spiritual cause. The relationship is causal, not metaphorical.

* **Water:** Corresponds to **Truth** (natural or spiritual).  
* **Heat/Fire:** Corresponds to **Love** (good or evil).  
* **Light:** Corresponds to **Wisdom**.  
* **Animals:** Correspond to specific **Affections**. A dog represents fidelity; a horse represents the understanding/intellect; a bird represents rational thought or spiritual ideas.8

Andersen utilizes this "language of nature" not as mere poetic simile but as a functional plot mechanic. In his tales, when a character's internal spiritual state changes, their external form or environment shifts to correspond to that new state.

## **III. The Little Mermaid: An Ontological Thriller**

*The Little Mermaid* (1837) is frequently misread as a tragic romance or a tale of unrequited love. Viewed through the Swedenborgian lens, however, it reveals itself as a rigorous theological drama about the acquisition of a discrete spiritual degree. It is, in essence, a story about **evolution across the barrier of the discrete**, moving from the Natural to the Spiritual.

### **3.1 The Sea as the Natural Degree**

The story opens in the "deep sea," a realm of extraordinary beauty but limited ontological status. In correspondence, the sea represents the **Natural** or **Sensual** degree of existence. The mermaids are elemental beings; they are perfect in their element, living for 300 years, but they lack the internal vessel for the Divine—the immortal soul.

Andersen is explicit about this distinction, mirroring Swedenborg’s definition of the animal soul:

"We have no immortal soul; we never have life again... Mortals, on the other hand, have a soul which lives forever after the body has turned to dust. It mounts up through the clear air to all the shining stars." 16

The mermaid’s longing is dual: she desires the Prince (a specific love) and an immortal soul (an eternal state). The tragedy of her condition is that as a being of the "Natural degree," she cannot generate a soul from within. She requires a link to a higher degree.

### **3.2 The Failed Sacrament of Marriage**

The grandmother explains the mechanism for acquiring a soul:

"Only if a mortal fell so much in love with you that you were dearer to him than a father and mother... only then would his soul float over into your body... He would give you a soul and still keep his own." 16

This plot device draws on the Romantic tradition of *Undine* by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, where a water spirit gains a soul through marriage. However, Swedenborg’s influence complicates this. In Swedenborgian theology, **Conjugial Love** (true marriage) is the union of **Love (Female)** and **Wisdom (Male)**, which forms a perfect spiritual whole. The mermaid seeks to become the "Love" (Will) to the Prince’s "Wisdom" (Intellect).

However, the Prince represents the **Natural Rational** man. He is attracted to the mermaid as a "foundling" or a pet (animal affection) but lacks the spiritual perception to recognize her true nature. He marries the Princess of the neighboring kingdom, whom he mistakenly believes saved him. The failure of the marriage signifies that the "Natural" cannot simply merge with the "Spiritual" through emotional attachment alone. The discrete degree cannot be bridged by proxy; the work of salvation must be internal.

### **3.3 The Rejection of the Knife: A Moral Choice and the Proprium**

The turning point of the narrative—and its sharpest divergence from folklore—is the scene with the knife. Her sisters offer her a way back to the sea (the Natural degree) by killing the Prince. This is a temptation to regress, to choose self-preservation (the **Proprium** or Selfhood) over **Charity**.

In Swedenborgian ethics, the "Proprium" is the source of all evil when separated from God; it is the love of self above others. By refusing to kill the Prince, even to save her own life, the mermaid performs a **moral act** contrary to her instinct for self-preservation. She sacrifices her Proprium. In Swedenborgian terms, she acts from **Charity** (neighbor-love). This act is the catalyst that opens the "internal spiritual man." She dies to the "Natural" world (dissolving into foam) but does not perish into nothingness because she has generated a spiritual substance through her choice.

### **3.4 The Daughters of the Air: Spiritual Progression via Use**

The ending of the tale, often criticized by modern scholars as tacked-on Christian moralizing, is the most purely Swedenborgian element of the text. The mermaid becomes a "Daughter of the Air."

"You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart... Your suffering and your loyalty have raised you up into the realm of airy spirits, and now in the course of three hundred years you may earn by your good deeds a soul that will never die." 19

Here, Andersen maps the Swedenborgian cosmology precisely:

1. **Water (Natural/Sensual):** The Mermaid’s origin.  
2. **Air (Spiritual/Rational):** The Mermaid’s new state. Air is a "higher" element than water, corresponding to the spiritual degree.  
3. **Stars/Heaven (Celestial):** The ultimate goal (Immortality).

The mermaid is not granted a soul instantly; she must **earn** it through "good deeds." This reflects Swedenborg’s central doctrine that **Charity (Use)** is the essential medium of salvation. One cannot simply be "given" heaven; one must acquire the *nature* of heaven through active usefulness.21 The mermaid enters a state of **probation** or **vastation**—an intermediate spiritual state (World of Spirits) where she must purify her intentions through service to others (cooling fevers, spreading fragrances) before she can enter the presence of God.

Table 1 illustrates the Swedenborgian progression evident in the narrative structure:

### **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Spiritual Progression in *The Little Mermaid***

| Narrative Stage | Element | Swedenborgian Degree | State of the Soul | Action Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mermaid (Beginning)** | Water (Sea) | Natural / Sensual | Animal Soul (Mortal) | Instinct / Desire |
| **Silent Human** | Earth (Land) | Natural Rational | Probationary | Suffering / Silence |
| **Daughter of the Air** | Air (Sky) | Spiritual | Spiritual Soul (Acquired) | Use / Charity / Good Deeds |
| **Ascension** | Sun / Stars | Celestial | Immortal / Angelic | Love / Conjunction |

## **IV. The Fracture of the Mind: Epistemology in 'The Snow Queen'**

If *The Little Mermaid* explores the **Will** and the acquisition of a soul, *The Snow Queen* (1844) explores the **Intellect** and the corruption of perception. It is an allegory of the "Fall," not into sin, but into **Intellectualism** divorced from **Love**. This narrative serves as a critique of the hyper-rationalism of Andersen’s age, grounded in Swedenborg’s distinction between "Scientia" (knowledge) and "Sapientia" (wisdom).

### **4.1 The Mirror and the Distortion of Truth**

The story begins with a demon (or troll) creating a mirror that shrinks the good and beautiful to nothingness while magnifying the bad and ugly. This mirror is a perfect correspondence for the **natural man’s intellect** when separated from Divine influx. Swedenborg writes extensively in *Divine Love and Wisdom* about how the "proprium" (selfhood) distorts truth, turning it into falsity.12

When the mirror shatters, a splinter enters Kai’s eye and another his heart.

* **The Eye:** Corresponds to the **Understanding**. Kai begins to see the world as flawed, mechanical, and ugly. He mocks his grandmother (tradition/faith) and Gerda (innocence). He becomes obsessed with the "mathematical" precision of snowflakes, preferring their dead symmetry to the living beauty of roses. This is **Scientia** separated from **Sapientia**.  
* **The Heart:** Corresponds to the **Will**. His heart becomes "a lump of ice." In Swedenborgian symbolism, **Ice** represents **Truth** bereft of **Heat (Love)**. It is hard, brittle, and cold. This is the state of "Faith Alone" (*sola fide*), a doctrine Swedenborg vehemently opposed as spiritually dead.

### **4.2 The Snow Queen: The Avatar of the Frozen Rational**

The Snow Queen acts as a personification of the **intellectual proprium** or the "False Rational." She abducts Kai to her palace in the frozen north (a correspondence for a spiritual state void of love). She promises him the whole world and a "new pair of skates" if he can solve the "Ice Puzzle of Reason" and form the word "Eternity."

This is a profound critique of Enlightenment rationalism. Kai attempts to understand "Eternity" (a Divine concept) using only "ice" (cold facts/natural truths). Swedenborg posits that spiritual truths cannot be grasped by the natural rational mind alone; they require the light of heaven. Thus, Kai is trapped in a loop of futile computation, "blue with cold" but unaware of it because his feelings have been numbed.23 He is in a state of spiritual **vastation**.

### **4.3 Gerda: The Affection for Truth**

Gerda represents the **Celestial** principle of **Love**, **Innocence**, or **Charity**. Her journey is not one of martial conquest but of persistent affection. She navigates the "menagerie of the mind"—talking crows, robber girls, reindeer—which correspond to various natural affections that must be aligned or subdued.

* **The Reindeer:** As a beast of burden, the reindeer (like the horse in Swedenborg’s system) corresponds to the **Intellect** or **Understanding** that carries the soul. The reindeer carries Gerda to the north but cannot enter the Queen's inner sanctum; love must walk the final steps alone. The reindeer represents the "subservient intellect" that supports the will but cannot substitute for it.

### **4.4 The Thaw: Regeneration**

The climax occurs when Gerda’s hot tears fall onto Kai’s chest, melting the ice in his heart and washing away the splinter in his eye.

"The tears fell on his chest, and penetrated to his heart; they thawed the lump of ice, and consumed the little piece of glass." 25

This is the restoration of **Influx**. The heat of Love (Gerda) restores the fluidity of Truth (water/tears) and reconnects the Will and Understanding. Kai is saved not by solving the puzzle, but by weeping—by feeling. They return home to find they have grown up, yet remain children at heart—a direct reference to Swedenborg’s (and Christ’s) teaching that "innocence" is the prerequisite for heaven (the Celestial kingdom).

## **V. The Shadow: The Theology of the Proprium and the External Man**

*The Shadow* (1847) is perhaps Andersen’s darkest and most psychologically complex tale, offering a stark warning about the Swedenborgian concept of the **Proprium** (the selfhood or ego). It dramatizes the danger of separating the external persona from the internal spirit.

### **5.1 The Separation of Substance and Form**

In the story, a learned man sends his shadow into the house of "Poetry" to see what is inside. The shadow enters, but the man does not. The shadow returns with a life of its own, eventually becoming rich, powerful, and corporeal, while the man withers away.

Swedenborg teaches that man is a vessel for life, not life itself. The "shadow" corresponds to the **external man** (the persona, the social self, the memory-knowledge) which mimics the internal spiritual man. In a healthy soul, the external serves the internal. However, when the external separates from the internal and assumes dominance, it becomes a monster. The Shadow is the **Proprium** vivified by self-love.

### **5.2 The Triumph of the Proprium**

The shadow claims to have seen everything in the house of Poetry, but it produces nothing. It blackmails the man, reverses their roles, and eventually executes the man. The shadow represents the **Hypocrite**—the entity that possesses the *form* of a man but lacks the *substance* (the soul/charity).

In Swedenborg’s *Spiritual Diary*, he describes spirits who "put on" the memories and personas of others, believing themselves to be those people.7 Andersen’s Shadow is a "spirit of the world" that usurps the place of the "spirit of truth." The learned man, who writes about "the True, the Good, and the Beautiful" (the Swedenborgian triad), is ignored by the world, while the Shadow, who understands the darkness and secrets of men, is celebrated. This is a cynical depiction of a society in the grip of **vastation**, where the external form is worshiped, and the internal truth is martyred.26

## **VI. The Girl Who Trod on the Loaf: Sin, Hell, and Verticality**

This tale serves as a companion piece to *The Little Mermaid*, mapping the *descent* into the hells rather than the ascent to the heavens. It provides a granular look at the Swedenborgian concept of **Profanation**.

### **6.1 The Profanation of Good**

Inger, a vain girl, throws a loaf of bread (a gift for her parents) into the mud to save her shoes. She steps on the bread and sinks instantly into the "Marsh Woman’s Brewery."

* **Bread:** In correspondences, Bread signifies **Celestial Good** (Divine Love/Charity).  
* **Mud/Marsh:** Corresponds to the **lowest Natural** degree, the realm of filth and falsity.

By trampling on "Good" (the bread) to preserve her "Vanity" (shoes/appearance), Inger commits an act of **Profanation**. She inverts the spiritual order, placing the lowest above the highest. In Swedenborg’s theology, profanation is the mixing of good and evil, a state worse than simple ignorance.29

### **6.2 The Petrified Soul in the Marsh Woman's Brewery**

In the underworld (Hell), Inger becomes a statue. She is rigid, unable to move, with flies creeping over her eyes.

"She was a statue of stone... stiff and unable to move... dreadfully hungry but could not break off any of the bread." 29

This corresponds to Swedenborg’s description of the infernal state: spirits in hell are often described as having their interiors ossified or being bound by their own ruling loves. They are "dead" because they have cut themselves off from the influx of Life (Love). The "Marsh Woman's Brewery" is a vivid depiction of a Swedenborgian hell, where the environment (smells, snakes, slime) is a direct projection of the internal state of the spirits inhabiting it.

### **6.3 Intercession and Bird-Form: Active Repentance**

Inger is eventually redeemed, but not through her own power. A bird (innocent thought) weeps for her. This external influx of pity begins to soften her stone heart. She eventually transforms into a small bird that must gather crumbs to replace the loaf she wasted.

This mirrors the Swedenborgian concept that **Repentance** must be active. One must "shun evils as sins" and perform uses. Inger cannot simply say "sorry"; she must labor (gather crumbs) to balance her spiritual ledger. Her ascent "straight into the sun" at the end is the return to the Divine Sun (the source of Love), marking the completion of her regeneration. This "bird state" is functionally identical to the "Daughter of the Air" state in *The Little Mermaid*—a probationary period of active charity.29

## **VII. The Spirit in Nature: The Role of Science and Ørsted**

The influence of Swedenborg on Andersen was mediated and reinforced by his relationship with H.C. Ørsted. Ørsted’s famous dictum, "The laws of nature are the thoughts of God," provided a scientific legitimacy to Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondences.

For Ørsted, and by extension Andersen, the scientist and the poet were engaged in the same task: reading the "book of nature" to understand the "book of revelation." This is evident in Andersen’s travelogues and lesser-known tales like *The Bell*, *The Ice Maiden*, and *Ole the Tower Keeper*.

### **7.1 The Bell: The Unity of Truth**

In *The Bell*, two paths lead to the great Bell (God): the path of the King (tradition/state) and the path of the Naturalist. They meet at the summit. Andersen validates both the religious and the scientific approach to the Divine, provided they are pursued with humility. The Bell’s sound unites the forest (nature) and the church (spirit), illustrating the Swedenborgian/Ørstedian belief in the fundamental unity of creation.30

### **7.2 The Ice Maiden: The Nature Spirit vs. The Soul**

*The Ice Maiden* presents a darker view of nature. The Ice Maiden is a personification of the elemental forces (glaciers). She claims the protagonist, Rudy, because he belongs to nature. Unlike the Little Mermaid, the Ice Maiden has no desire for a soul; she represents the **unregenerate natural force** that seeks to reclaim its own. The conflict between Rudy (the human soul) and the Ice Maiden (the elemental force) highlights the danger of the "natural degree" when it seeks to swallow the spiritual.32

### **7.3 Ole the Tower Keeper: The Spiritual Observer**

In *Ole the Tower Keeper*, the protagonist looks down on the world from a church tower, observing the "degrees" of humanity. He describes "glasses" of different toasts, which contain various spirits—from health to the devil.34 This categorization of human states into distinct vessels or "degrees" reflects the Swedenborgian habit of classifying spirits and states of mind. Ole serves as the detached, Swedenborgian seer, analyzing the spiritual content of the chaotic city below.

## **VIII. Coda: The Afterlife of Andersen's Cosmology in Popular Culture**

A common critique holds that popular adaptations of Andersen's tales—particularly those by Walt Disney Studios—strip away the theological substance. This critique requires significant qualification.

Disney's *The Little Mermaid* (1989) preserves the spiritual mechanics even while translating them for a different audience:

- **Ariel's grotto** of human artifacts functions as **remains**—spiritual goods stored in the interior that maintain connection to higher states
- Her **recognition of the storm** and rescue of the prince enacts **spiritual resurrection**
- **Triton's rejection** of the surface world depicts the **natural mind rejecting the spiritual**
- **Ariel's bargain with Ursula** represents reliance on **self-intelligence**—attempting to achieve spiritual states through one's own power
- Her **loss of voice** corresponds to the loss of the **power of truth**, which cannot be self-generated
- The **silent period** with the prince constitutes **vastation**—the regenerating soul feeling mute, no longer perceiving the Lord
- The **confrontation with Ursula** dramatizes the rejection of the **proprium**
- **Triton's final granting of legs** (not Ursula's magic) represents proper **conjunction**—the natural degree granting what the spiritual wills, through the ruling principle properly ordered
- The **conjugial love ending** is not simplification but the proper terminus: Will and Understanding united

What genuinely constitutes a departure from Andersen's framework is not simplification but **inversion**. Certain later productions (notably *Wish*, 2023) do not merely translate the mechanics for modern audiences but systematically reverse the vertical causality into a Gnostic counter-theology: the authority figure becomes a demiurge, wishes are inherently good and stolen by oppressors, and the protagonist's power is self-sourced rather than received through influx. This is not adaptation but profanation—the active inversion of the spiritual framework rather than its translation into accessible form.

Recognizing which adaptations preserve Andersen's cartography—even in translated form—from those that invert it entirely is essential for understanding the ongoing cultural transmission of correspondential thought.

## **IX. Conclusion: The Fairy Tale as Theological Vessel**

Hans Christian Andersen was not merely a spinner of yarns for the nursery; he was a vernacular theologian of the Romantic age. His works constitute a coherent engagement with the metaphysical problems of his time, structured by the architectonics of Emanuel Swedenborg.

The analysis demonstrates that:

1. **Correspondences are Structural:** Andersen uses animals, landscapes, and elements (sea, ice, air, marsh) not as decorative metaphors but as ontological containers for specific spiritual principles, aligning with Swedenborg’s semiotics.  
2. **The Soul is Evolutionary:** Andersen rejects the static soul of orthodoxy. Like Swedenborg, he views the soul as a dynamic vessel that must be formed, reformed, and regenerated through moral choice and active charity (The Mermaid, Inger).  
3. **Discrete Degrees Define the Narrative Arc:** The movement in Andersen’s tales is vertical—from the mud/sea (Natural) to the air/earth (Spiritual) to the sun/stars (Celestial). This ascent requires a transformation of nature, not just a change of location.  
4. **The Proprium is the Antagonist:** Whether it is the Shadow, the Snow Queen’s mirror, or Inger’s shoes, the villain in Andersen’s cosmology is always the Selfhood separated from the Divine.

By integrating the "Scientific Theology" of Swedenborg with the folk tradition, Andersen created a new mythology for the modern age—one where the struggle for immortality is fought not with swords, but with the quiet, persistent labor of the heart.

Restoring the Swedenborgian context reveals Andersen's true stature: a cartographer of the invisible, guiding the reader through the perilous geography of the human soul.

### **Table 2: Comparative Analysis of Swedenborgian Concepts in Andersen’s Tales**

| Andersen Tale | Primary Swedenborgian Concept | Narrative Manifestation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Little Mermaid** | *Discrete Degrees / Human Soul* | Ascent from Sea (Natural) to Air (Spiritual) via moral choice; earning a soul through use (Good Deeds). |
| **The Snow Queen** | *Intellect vs. Will / Faith Alone* | The "Ice Puzzle" of pure reason vs. the "Warmth" of charity; the frozen heart (proprium) melted by love. |
| **The Shadow** | *Proprium / External Man* | The Shadow (Ego/Persona) separates from the Spirit, mimics humanity, and destroys the internal man. |
| **The Girl Who Trod on the Loaf** | *Profanation / Vastation* | Trampling Celestial Good (Bread) for Natural Vanity (Shoes); petrification in hell; redemption through active service. |
| **The Ice Maiden** | *Nature Spirit vs. Soul* | The conflict between the elemental force (Ice Maiden) which claims the body, and the Soul which belongs to God. |
| **The Bell** | *Correspondence / Unity of Truth* | Nature and Church as two corresponding paths to the same Divine Source (The Bell). |
| **Ole the Tower Keeper** | *Spiritual Observation / Degrees* | The categorization of human states into distinct "glasses" or degrees; the detached observer perspective. |

The evidence suggests that while Andersen may have worn the mask of the naive storyteller, his pen was dipped in the ink of the visionary. He did not just write fairy tales; he wrote *Arcana Coelestia* for the nursery.
