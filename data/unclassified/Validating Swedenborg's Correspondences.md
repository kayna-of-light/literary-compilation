# **The Hermeneutics of the Mundus Imaginalis: An Independent Methodological Validation of Swedenborgian Correspondences**

## **1\. Introduction: The Epistemological Crisis of Circularity**

The theological corpus of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) presents a radical epistemological claim: the existence of a "Science of Correspondences," a universal semiotic law wherein the natural world acts as a causal mirror of the spiritual world. In this framework, the literal text of the Hebrew Bible is not merely a historical record but a vessel for an "internal sense," describing the regeneration of the human soul and the glorification of the Divine Human. However, this system faces a profound methodological crisis when subjected to post-Enlightenment critical scrutiny: the problem of circularity. The standard apologetic argument—that Swedenborg’s revelation is true because the internal sense is coherent, and the internal sense is coherent because the revelation is true—constitutes a closed logical loop. This unfalsifiability problem places Swedenborg’s exegesis outside the bounds of conventional verification; if a correspondence (e.g., "Assyria represents the rational mind") relies solely on the author's visionary authority, it cannot be tested, only accepted or rejected on faith.  
This report establishes an **independent methodological framework** for validating correspondential interpretations without presupposing Swedenborg’s charismatic authority. By triangulating Swedenborg’s claims against **Historical-Critical Biblical Scholarship**, **Comparative Semiotics**, **Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) Archaeology**, and **Depth Psychology**, we can determine if the "Science of Correspondences" exhibits structural isomorphism with independent systems of meaning. The research investigates whether the symbols identified by Swedenborg are arbitrary allegories (inventions of the author) or genuine archetypes (universal structures of the psyche and history).  
The inquiry is driven by five critical sub-questions: (1) Can we distinguish legitimate symbolism from arbitrary allegory using literary criteria? (2) Does the "authorial intent" identified by secular source criticism (J/P sources) validate Swedenborg’s distinctions? (3) Do pre-Swedenborgian traditions (Philo, Origen, Kabbalah) independently map the same terrain? (4) Do these patterns appear cross-culturally in ANE mythology? (5) Can this system generate testable hermeneutic predictions?

## **2\. The Logic of the Symbol: Distinguishing Correspondence from Arbitrary Allegory**

To validate Swedenborg’s system, one must first demarcate his specific claim from general literary allegory. The conflation of "correspondence" with "metaphor" obscures the ontological nature of Swedenborg's argument.

### **2.1 The Correspondence Theory of Truth vs. Vertical Causality**

In analytic philosophy, the **Correspondence Theory of Truth** asserts that a statement is true if it accurately describes a state of affairs in the material world (e.g., "The cat is on the mat" is true if a cat is empirically present). Swedenborg appropriates this terminology but rotates the axis of verification from horizontal (word-to-world) to vertical (world-to-spirit). For Swedenborg, the "cat" and the "mat" are themselves signs; their "truth" lies in their faithful representation of spiritual affections and states.  
This aligns with **Platonic Realism**, where the material world is a shadow of Ideal Forms, but Swedenborg adds a dynamic, causal element. Correspondences are not poetic resemblances; they are causal links. A physical smile corresponds to affection not because they look alike, but because affection *causes* the facial muscles to contract into a smile. Therefore, a valid correspondence must demonstrate a **functional causality** between the spiritual cause and the natural effect.

### **2.2 Criteria for Legitimate Symbolism**

Literary theorists, notably Goethe and Coleridge, provide independent criteria for distinguishing "symbol" from "allegory," which can serve as a control mechanism for evaluating Swedenborg’s exegesis.

| Feature | Allegory (Arbitrary) | Symbol / Correspondence (Organic) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Origin** | Invented by the author for rhetorical effect. | Discovered; inherent in the nature of the object. |
| **Relationship** | Mechanical substitution (e.g., Scales \= Justice). | Synecdochic participation; the symbol *is* the reality in a lower form. |
| **Meaning** | Single, static, abstract concept. | Multivalent, translucent, inexhaustible. |
| **Validation** | Requires a key or codebook to decipher. | Validated by the functional analogy of the object itself. |

**Application to Swedenborg:** Critics often accuse Swedenborg of "arbitrary and fanciful" allegorizing. However, applying Goethe’s criteria reveals that Swedenborg’s method is strictly symbolical (organic).

* *Case Study:* Swedenborg states **Light \= Wisdom** and **Heat \= Love**.  
* *Validation:* This is not arbitrary. Phenomenologically, light allows the eye to distinguish forms (function of intellect), while heat sustains organic life (function of will/love). The correspondence is grounded in the *physics* of the object, satisfying the criteria for "organic symbolism" rather than "arbitrary allegory."

### **2.3 The Philosophical Problem of Falsifiability**

Karl Popper’s criterion of falsifiability suggests that a theory is scientific only if it can be proven wrong. Swedenborg’s system includes a "safety valve"—the concept of the **Opposite Sense**. A symbol (e.g., Lion) can represent the Lord (Lion of Judah) or the Devil (roaring lion), depending on context. While this seemingly evades falsifiability, it reflects a psychological reality: the same force (e.g., Fire/Love) is life-giving in moderation and destructive in excess (Lust/Hate). To validate this, we must look not for simple uniformity, but for **contextual consistency**—does the symbol *always* refer to the "power of the will," whether for good or evil?

## **3\. The Historical-Critical Crucible: Source Criticism as Unintended Validation**

Modern biblical scholarship, specifically the **Documentary Hypothesis** (JEDP), argues that the Pentateuch is a composite of distinct sources woven together by redactors. Swedenborg, writing a century before Wellhausen, treated the text as a unified Word. Paradoxically, source criticism provides one of the strongest independent validations of Swedenborg’s "internal sense," as his spiritual distinctions map precisely onto the stylistic seams identified by secular scholars.

### **3.1 The Two Creation Accounts: Phenomenology of the "J" and "P" Sources**

Scholars universally recognize Genesis 1 (P Source) and Genesis 2 (J Source) as distinct narratives with contradictory orders of creation and different divine names (*Elohim* vs. *YHWH*).

* **Genesis 1 (The Priestly Source):** Characterized by order, liturgy, transcendence, and the name *Elohim*. Creation moves from chaos to order. Man and Woman are created simultaneously.  
* **Genesis 2 (The Jahwist Source):** Characterized by anthropomorphism, immanence, soil/earth, and the name *YHWH*. Man is formed from dust; Woman is built from Man.

**Swedenborg’s Independent Correlation:** Swedenborg interprets these not as historical accounts but as descriptions of two distinct types of human regeneration, which he terms the **Spiritual Church** and the **Celestial Church**.

| Feature | Historical Criticism (Source Analysis) | Swedenborg (Internal Sense) | Validation Insight |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Divine Name** | *Elohim* (Generic God, Transcendent). | *Elohim* corresponds to **Divine Truth**. The "Spiritual" state is formed via Intellect/Truth. | Swedenborg’s assignment of "Truth" to *Elohim* matches the P source's emphasis on legal/structural order. |
| **Divine Name** | *YHWH* (Proper Name, Relational). | *Jehovah* corresponds to **Divine Love**. The "Celestial" state is formed via Will/Love. | Swedenborg’s assignment of "Love" to *YHWH* matches the J source's intimate, relational theology. |
| **Process** | Sequential, logical days (1–6). | Regeneration of the **Intellect** (Faith). Requires ordering truth out of chaos. | The "P" source's logical structure mirrors the cognitive process of learning. |
| **Process** | Organic, agricultural (Garden). | Regeneration of the **Will** (Charity). Requires growth, life, and perception. | The "J" source's organic imagery mirrors the volitional process of loving. |

**Conclusion:** Swedenborg’s hermeneutic "predicted" the qualitative difference between Genesis 1 and 2 long before source criticism formalized it. He accounts for the switch in divine names and literary style not as editorial clumsiness, but as a necessary shift in spiritual subject matter (Intellect vs. Will). The **Documentary Hypothesis independently confirms** that the text contains exactly the two distinct "voices" Swedenborg identified.

### **3.2 The Flood Narrative (Genesis 6–9): Structural Continuity**

The Flood narrative is a complex interweaving of J and P, resulting in "doublets" (repetitions) and chronological discrepancies (40 days vs. 150 days).

* **The Doublets:** Why are Noah and the animals described entering the ark twice (Gen 7:7-9 and 7:13-16)? Critics see two texts spliced together. Swedenborg argues that repetitions in the Word refer to the **heavenly marriage** of Good and Truth. One mention refers to the *will* (affections entering protection), the other to the *understanding* (truths entering protection).  
* **The Chiasm:** Literary scholars like Cassuto and Anderson have identified a "palistrophe" (concentric structure) in the Flood story, centering on Gen 8:1 "God remembered Noah". This tightly knit structure defies the notion of a haphazard cut-and-paste job. Swedenborg’s verse-by-verse exposition treats the narrative as a continuous spiritual progression (Temptation \\to Desolation \\to Fluctuation \\to Regeneration). His ability to derive a coherent psychological sequence from a "fractured" text suggests that the final Redactor (R) constructed the text with a unified theological intent that aligns with Swedenborg’s internal sense.

## **4\. The Archetypal Axis: Comparative Mythology and ANE Symbology**

If Swedenborg’s correspondences are "universal," they should align with the symbolic languages of the Ancient Near East (ANE), the cultural milieu from which the biblical text emerged. Swedenborg claimed the "Ancient Church" (a primordial civilization) possessed the knowledge of correspondences. Modern archaeology allows us to test this claim.

### **4.1 Assyria: The Rational Mind**

Swedenborg consistently corresponds **Assyria** (Hebrew: *Asshur*) to the **Rational Principle** or "Reasoning".

* **Etymological Evidence:** The Hebrew *Asshur* derives from a root meaning "a step," "progression," or "going straight". This etymology is structurally isomorphic to "logic" (from *logos*), which implies a linear, step-by-step progression of thought.  
* **Historical Evidence:** The Neo-Assyrian Empire was the first true *bureaucratic* state, defined by hyper-organization, mathematical precision in warfare, and the systematic cataloging of knowledge (e.g., the Library of Ashurbanipal).  
* **The Sacred Tree:** Simo Parpola’s analysis of the Assyrian Sacred Tree reveals it as a diagram of the "Perfect Man" (the King) maintaining cosmic order—a precursor to the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. This validates Swedenborg’s view of Assyria as the "Rational" axis that connects (or disconnects) the spiritual and natural worlds.  
* **Biblical Validation:** Isaiah 10:5 calls Assyria the "rod of My anger." A rod is a tool of measurement and rule—symbols of the intellect's power to judge and categorize. Swedenborg’s identification of Assyria as the "Reasoning Faculty" is historically and philologically robust.

### **4.2 Egypt: The Scientific Mind**

Swedenborg corresponds **Egypt** (*Mizraim*) to **Memory-Knowledge** or "Scientifics" (facts derived from the senses).

* **Historical Context:** Ancient Egypt was the Mediterranean world's center of *empirical knowledge*—geometry, medicine, astronomy, and engineering. It was the "granary" of the ancient world.  
* **Functional Analogy:** Just as Egypt stored grain to preserve life during famine, the memory stores "knowledges" (scientifics) to preserve the mind during spiritual hunger. Swedenborg’s interpretation of the Exodus—the liberation of the spiritual man from the bondage of mere sensory knowledge—perfectly overlays the historical function of Egypt as the master of the material/sensory realm.

### **4.3 The Horse: The Intellect**

A central Swedenborgian correspondence is **Horse \= Understanding/Intellect**.

* **ANE Symbolism:** In the ANE, the horse was a technology of *elite movement* and war, not agriculture (which used oxen). It represents power, swiftness, and guidance.  
* **Mythological Validation:** Swedenborg explicitly cites the Greek myth of **Pegasus** (a winged horse) striking the earth to create the fountain of Hippocrene (source of the Muses/Wisdom). He interprets this as: *Intellect* (Horse) elevated to *Spiritual* things (Wings) produces *Intelligence* (Fountain).  
* **Biblical Consistency:** In Revelation 19, Christ returns on a "White Horse" and is called the "Word of God." If Christ is the Logos (Divine Truth), his vehicle must be the pure Understanding of Truth. The correspondence holds consistent across Greek and Hebrew contexts.

## **5\. The Perennial Stream: Pre-Swedenborgian Exegesis**

If the Science of Correspondences is objective, other mystics should have glimpsed it. The "River of Tradition" provides a control group.

### **5.1 Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE)**

Philo, integrating Judaism and Platonism, developed an allegorical system strikingly similar to Swedenborg’s.

* **The Patriarchs:** Philo views Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob not as mere men but as "ensouled laws" representing **Learning**, **Nature**, and **Practice**. This parallels Swedenborg’s view of them as the **Celestial**, **Spiritual**, and **Natural** degrees of the Lord’s life.  
* **Egypt:** Philo explicitly interprets "Egypt" as the **Body** and the **Senses**. The Exodus is the migration of the soul (Logos) out of the domain of the passions. This is identical to Swedenborg’s definition of Egypt as the "natural man" and "sensory knowledge."

### **5.2 Kabbalah and the Zohar**

Though Swedenborg never cites the Zohar, the structural parallels suggest access to a shared archetypal reality (or indirect influence via Christian Kabbalists like Knorr von Rosenroth).

| Symbol | Kabbalah (Zohar) | Swedenborg (Arcana Coelestia) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cosmic Form** | *Adam Kadmon*: The universe is structured as a primordial man. | *Maximus Homo* (Grand Man): Heaven is structured as a giant human form. |
| **Shells/Husks** | *Klippot*: Impure shells that conceal the divine spark. | *Scientifics/Proprium*: External knowledges that contain (or choke) spiritual truth. |
| **Divine Union** | *Tiferet* (Male) & *Shekhinah* (Female) union. | Marriage of *Love* (Will) & *Wisdom* (Understanding) in the Divine. |

**Conclusion:** The convergence of Philo, the Zohar, and Swedenborg on specific symbols (Egypt=Senses; Cosmic Man; Sexual duality of God) validates that these correspondences are not idiosyncratic inventions but part of a **perennial hermeneutic tradition**.

## **6\. The Psychological Verification: Phenomenology and the *Mundus Imaginalis***

The strongest independent validation comes from 20th-century Depth Psychology and Phenomenology, which mapped the "objective psyche."

### **6.1 Henry Corbin and the *Mundus Imaginalis***

Scholar Henry Corbin coined the term *Mundus Imaginalis* (Imaginal World) to describe the Sufi concept of *Alam al-Mithal*—a real ontological plane between the sensory and the intelligible.

* **The Distinction:** Corbin distinguishes the *Imaginal* (a cognitive organ of perception perceiving real spiritual forms) from the *Imaginary* (unreal fantasy).  
* **Validation of Swedenborg:** Corbin explicitly identifies Swedenborg’s "World of Spirits" as the *Mundus Imaginalis*. He argues that Swedenborg’s "correspondences" are the **physics of the Imaginal Realm**. In this world, an internal state (e.g., rage) *automatically* manifests as an external symbol (e.g., a wolf). Swedenborg did not "invent" the wolf correspondence; he observed the phenomenological law of that plane.

### **6.2 Jungian Archetypes and Individuation**

Carl Jung read Swedenborg and noted the similarity between Swedenborg’s "spirits" and his own "autonomous complexes".

* **Regeneration as Individuation:** Swedenborg’s "Regeneration" (the subduing of the *Proprium* or ego-self by the Lord/Self) maps precisely onto Jung’s "Individuation" (the integration of the Ego into the greater Self).  
* **Dream Symbols:** Jung’s empirical analysis of patient dreams validated key Swedenborgian symbols: **Water** as the Unconscious/Truth; the **House** as the structure of the Psyche; the **Marriage** (*Coniunctio*) as the unification of opposites.  
* **Northrop Frye:** The literary critic Northrop Frye, influenced by Blake (a Swedenborgian), identified the "Great Code" of the Bible as a self-contained system of archetypes (City, Garden, Mountain) that mirrors Swedenborg’s system of "representatives".

## **7\. Testable Predictions: Can Correspondences Be Falsified?**

If the "Science of Correspondences" is a valid methodology, it must be predictive. We can formulate "predictions" regarding how specific symbols should function in texts Swedenborg did not analyze or in future psychological states.

### **7.1 Prediction 1: Intertextual Consistency**

*Hypothesis:* If **Water \= Truth** , this meaning should hold across disparate biblical authors and genres.

* *Test:*  
  * **Ritual:** Baptism (Water) initiates into the Church. Meaning: Initiation via Truth/Instruction.  
  * **Prophecy:** Amos 8:11 speaks of a "thirst" not for water, but for "hearing the words of the Lord." Meaning: Water \= Word/Truth.  
  * **Gospel:** Jesus offers "Living Water" (John 4). Context: He is speaking to the Samaritan woman about *true worship*.  
  * **Nature:** Water cleanses (Truth removes error); Water quenches thirst (Truth satisfies curiosity).  
* *Result:* The symbol is internally consistent and structurally robust across the canon.

### **7.2 Prediction 2: Psychological Integration**

*Hypothesis:* If the Exodus narrative corresponds to the stages of psychological regeneration, then an individual undergoing spiritual crisis should experience dream imagery matching the narrative sequence (Bondage \\to Crossing Water \\to Wilderness \\to Promised Land).

* *Test:* Jungian analyst Shoshana Fershtman’s *The Mystical Exodus in Jungian Perspective* documents case studies where trauma survivors spontaneously produce Exodus imagery (Red Sea crossings, desert wanderings) during their recovery (regeneration) process.  
* *Result:* The correspondence functions as a predictive map of the psyche's healing trajectory.

## **8\. Conclusion: A Methodological Synthesis**

The research question asked if there is *any* methodology for validating Swedenborg’s correspondences that does not presuppose his authority. The investigation yields a definitive **YES**, provided validation is understood as **hermeneutic coherence** and **structural isomorphism** rather than positivist empirical proof.  
**Summary of Findings:**

1. **Source Criticism Validation:** Swedenborg’s "Internal Sense" accurately predicts and explains the stylistic duality (J vs. P) of the Pentateuch as a necessary spiritual dialectic between Will and Understanding.  
2. **Historical Validation:** The correspondences for nations (Assyria, Egypt) are rooted in the objective historical functions and etymologies of those civilizations, not arbitrary invention.  
3. **Phenomenological Validation:** The system is consistent with the "Laws of the Imaginal" described by Corbin and the "Archetypes" mapped by Jung. It functions effectively as a cartography of consciousness.  
4. **Perennial Validation:** The convergence with Philo, Origen, and Kabbalah indicates that Swedenborg accessed a shared, objective tradition of spiritual semiotics.

**Final Verdict:** Swedenborg’s "Science of Correspondences" is a rigorous, internally consistent, and historically grounded semiotic system. While its metaphysical origin remains a matter of faith, its **interpretive utility** and **structural integrity** are verifiable by independent scholarly methods. It offers a "Poetics of the Spirit" that anticipates and harmonizes with the insights of modern depth psychology, literary theory, and historical criticism.
