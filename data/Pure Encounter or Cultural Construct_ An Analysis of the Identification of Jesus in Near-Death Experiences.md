# **Pure Encounter or Cultural Construct? An Analysis of the Identification of Jesus in Near-Death Experiences**

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of a central, complex question in perceptual and near-death studies: Is the identification of the figure of Jesus during a near-death experience (NDE) a "pure identification" of a transcendent, objective reality, or is it primarily a "dogmatic, cultural identification" primed by the experiencer's background?  
An examination of phenomenological reports and academic studies reveals a profound tension. A significant body of testimonial evidence supports the "pure identification" hypothesis, detailing anomalous encounters from individuals with no prior Christian framework. These include devout atheists , Muslims , Hindus , and Buddhists who report an "innate knowing" of a figure they identify as Jesus.  
Conversely, academic research highlights cross-cultural differences—such as in Japanese NDEs, where a "Being of Light" is not personified —suggesting cultural expectation shapes the experience.  
This report resolves this tension, concluding that the identification of Jesus is a **pure identification based on a direct personality match**. The "Being of Light" encountered in NDEs is not just an abstract illumination; it possesses a distinct and unique personality: one of "unconditional, absolute, and unearned" love , "total awareness joined with total acceptance," and a non-judgmental nature ("judgment had always been human. God only teaches"). This personality is a *perfect correspondence* to the "Divine Human" as He is revealed in the Gospels—a figure who also refutes the *proprium* (self-love) and preaches the universal, internal "Path of Love".  
This "personality match" thesis is further supported by the "Dogma Paradox": the NDE-Jesus consistently delivers a message of universal love that *supersedes* and *contradicts* the exclusivist dogma of many religious institutions. This proves the experience is not a projection of dogmatic belief.  
Finally, this framework also re-contextualizes seemingly contradictory "hellish" NDEs, such as that of Pastor Howard Pittman. His experience was not a contradiction of the "Path of Love," but a *confirmation* of the *conflict* between the "Internal Path" and the "Antagonist Path". It was a divine judgment on the *dogma* of "faith alone" —which is a manifestation of the *proprium* (self-love) —and his vision of hell was a correspondial vision of the world dominated by this *proprium*.

## **I. The Phenomenon of the "Unexpected Jesus": Testimonial Evidence for Pure Identification**

The strongest evidence that the identification is "pure" and not a cultural projection is found in anomalous testimonial data. These are cases where the experiencer's established belief system not only fails to predict the encounter but would, in fact, predict the *opposite*.

### **A. The Atheist Encounter**

Encounters reported by devout atheists challenge the "cultural expectancy hypothesis."

* **Case Study: Heidi Barr.** Raised by a devout atheist father who explicitly taught her that Jesus was "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on mankind" , Barr's cultural priming was entirely secular. Following a fatal accident, she encountered a figure and *instantly* "knew Him," identifying him as Jesus. She reported, "Every cell in my soul knew everything about who He was". This "innate knowing" bypassed her lifelong indoctrination.  
* **Case Study: Gina Bonomo.** A "devout atheist" from a "science-driven family," Bonomo had an NDE where she saw a man radiating an "explosion of light" and heard an unmistakable, deep voice. She dismissed it for decades as a drug-fueled hallucination. It was only years later, when she heard the *exact same unmistakable voice* again while sober, that she validated the experience and identified the figure as Jesus.

In these cases, the experiencers' "prime" should have been a void, not the central figure of a religion they actively rejected.

### **B. The Muslim Encounter**

Similar anomalies are reported by NDErs from other major world religions.

* **Case Study: Bibi.** A devout Muslim from Iran, Bibi suffered a fatal heart attack, consumed by "heart-crushing guilt" that her children had converted to Christianity. Her dogmatic expectation was to be judged by Imam Ali. Instead, she was met by a "giant man in a majestic white robe". The figure did not name himself "Jesus" but communicated "thought to thought," declaring, "I am he who is". A year later, in a *second* vision, she saw his face and "knew this was Jesus".

### **C. The Hindu Encounter**

Hindu accounts often present a "fulfillment" model, where the NDE-Jesus is revealed as the universal truth *behind* their existing religious seeking.

* **Case Study: Avind (Hindu Monk).** During his NDE, a former Hindu monk was met by Jesus, who stated, "I am the one you have been seeking". The message was explicitly universalist: Jesus said he had not come to "destroy" sincere seeking in any religion, but to "fulfill" it.  
* **Case Study: Santosh.** A Hindu man named Santosh experienced an NDE where he saw a "God of light" and a figure on a throne by a "very narrow gate". He did not identify this figure. He spent *two years* searching for the compassionate God he had met. He only made the connection after attending a Christian church and hearing a pastor preach about the "narrow gate" (Matthew 7\) and Jesus's declaration "I am the gate" (John 10), which directly matched his NDE vision.

These accounts depict the identification as the discovery of a universal truth, with the NDE-Jesus positioning himself as the objective *fulfillment* of all sincere seeking.

## **II. The Epistemology of Identification: A Pure Match of Personality**

The "pure vs. cultural" debate is resolved by analyzing *how* experiencers identify this figure. The evidence shows the identification is not a visual deduction (based on cultural paintings) but an "innate knowing" based on a *direct match* with a unique, transcendent personality.

### **A. The "Being of Light" as a Universal Personality**

The "Being of Light" is the most common element of NDEs. This being is consistently defined not by its form, but by its *unique personality*. It is described as a "supreme being of unfathomable love" , radiating "unconditional love" and "total awareness joined with total acceptance". It is non-judgmental; as one experiencer noted, "I realized that judgment had always been human. God only teaches".

### **B. The Personality Match**

This unique personality is a *perfect correspondence* to the "Divine Human" as He is revealed in the Gospels. The Gospel Jesus refutes the *proprium's* (self-love's) desire for an external, physical kingdom and a "struggle for power". His message is the universal, internal "Path of Love" ("love your neighbor").  
Therefore, the identification process is not a "cultural projection." It is a **pure identification based on a personality match**.  
When experiencers—even atheists or those from other faiths—encounter this unique personality of pure, non-judgmental love, they are having a *pure encounter* with the "sun in heaven". Their "innate knowing" is the recognition that this specific, transcendent personality—this "Divine Human in ultimates" —is, and can only be, Jesus Christ. One experiencer articulated this perfectly: "I did not see the Spirit as I had seen Jesus... depicted in paintings, but the innate knowing of my heart remembered and acknowledged Christ. The radiant Spirit was Christ, the manifestation and expression of pure love".

## **III. The Cultural Expectancy Hypothesis: A Flawed Counter-Argument**

The primary counter-argument to the "pure identification" model is the "cultural expectancy hypothesis." This theory posits that the NDE is a subjective projection, and its content is filled by the individual's "dogmatic, cultural" background.

### **A. Cross-Cultural Data**

The strongest evidence for this hypothesis comes from cross-cultural NDE research, which reveals significant variations in NDE content.

* **Japanese NDEs:** A key comparative analysis by Greyson and Ohkado identified "main differences" between Japanese and Western NDEs. While Japanese experiencers do report an "ineffably euphoric" bright light, they do *not* interpret it as a personal "being of light". This results in a "concomitant lack of interaction with it" and an absence of the specific Western "sense of being loved" *by* the light.  
* **Thai NDEs:** Research on Thai NDEs shows different content, often featuring "Yamatoots" (messengers of death from Hinduism).  
* **Other Variations:** Studies note that Twelver Shīʿīsm experiencers have reported seeing Shiite imams.

### **B. Rebuttal to the Expectancy Hypothesis**

While compelling, the expectancy hypothesis is insufficient to explain the full range of data.

* **Van Lommel's Dutch Study:** A large-scale, prospective NDE study published in *The Lancet* provides a powerful rebuttal. It "excluded physiological, psychological, pharmacological and demographic explanations" for NDEs. Most critically, it found that "any kind of religious belief, or indeed its absence in non-religious people or atheists, was irrelevant" to *whether* an NDE occurred. This finding directly contradicts the simple expectancy hypothesis.  
* **Greyson's Pre-1975 Study:** Researcher Bruce Greyson directly tested the "cultural priming" hypothesis. He compared NDEs reported *before* Raymond Moody's 1975 book popularized the NDE "model" and those reported *after*. He found *no statistically significant difference* in 14 of the 15 features. This challenges the idea that NDEs are "substantially influenced by prevailing cultural models".  
* **Kellehear's "Ineffability" Argument:** Sociologist Allan Kellehear argues that the "ineffable" (indescribable) nature of the NDE is the "very opposite of the theoretical problem of social expectations". Experiencers are not calmly describing a *familiar* cultural projection; they are struggling to find words for a profoundly *unfamiliar* experience that shatters their existing framework.

The expectancy hypothesis, therefore, appears insufficient. The cross-cultural differences (like in Japan ) do not prove that the "Being of Light" *has no* personality; they may simply indicate that the "Divine Human in ultimates" is not revealed in every NDE, even if the "sun in heaven" (the Light) is.

## **IV. The "Dogma Paradox": When the NDE-Jesus Contradicts Christian Dogma**

The most significant finding is the "Dogma Paradox." If the Jesus figure were merely a "dogmatic, cultural identification," he *should* consistently reflect the experiencer's specific dogma. The fact that he *usually doesn't*—and often actively *refutes* it—is the strongest evidence that the experience is *not* a simple projection of dogmatic belief.

### **A. The NDE-Jesus of Unconditional Love and Universalism**

The dominant message reported from the NDE-Jesus is one of "unconditional love" and "no judgment". This experience frequently leads NDErs to adopt a universalist theology.

* This message stands in "tension with Christian theology" regarding exclusivity and damnation.  
* It leads many to conclude that *all* people are saved, regardless of belief , a "Doctrine of Universal Salvation".  
* One NDEr stated they no longer view Christianity as a "religion with a dogma that's antiquated... and full of hate and judgment," but as a "relationship with Jesus Christ".  
* This experiential data empirically supports the premise that all good and truth is *received* from the Lord, demonstrating that all are "fully capable of this love" and that this *experience* washes away sin, contrary to "faith alone" dogmas that reject this direct "inflow into our very soul".

### **B. The Direct Conflict with Exclusivist Dogma**

This message of universal, unconditional love is in direct conflict with traditional, exclusivist Christian dogma.

* It contradicts doctrines of hell and judgment , which state "the way is narrow".  
* Theological analyses explicitly argue *against* the NDE message of "unconditional love," stating that God's love is *not* unconditional and that moral judgment is essential.

This paradox refutes the simple "dogmatic identification" hypothesis. The identification is *not* a projection *of* dogma; it is an experience that *corrects* dogma.

## **V. Re-contextualizing "Hellish" NDEs and the State of Humanity**

Seemingly contradictory "hellish" NDEs, and the question of bias in the data, do not refute this framework. Instead, they *confirm* the *conflict* between the "Internal Path" and the "Antagonist Path".

### **A. The Case of Howard Pittman: A Judgment on the *Proprium***

The NDE of Pastor Howard Pittman is a key example. Pittman, a man who had committed his "entire life to preaching the gospel," was told by God in his NDE that his "works were an abomination".  
This was not a judgment from the "Path of Love" God on humanity. It was a divine judgment on the *dogma* he represented: the "dead orthodoxy" of "faith alone." This dogma, by teaching that humans "will never be able to truly do any good" and are saved only by *believing* in the resurrection, not by *living* a life of love (charity) , is itself a form of the *proprium* (self-love). It "cuts off the divine" inflow by teaching that we *cannot* do good, thereby "inherently reject\[ing\] his inflow into our very soul". Pittman's experience was a judgment on this specific "antagonist" path.

### **B. The 98% and the Nature of Hell**

Pittman's vision that "98% of the people on earth... are headed to hell" must be understood correspondially, not literally.

* **The 98% as a Correspondial Vision:** This is not a "literal count" of humanity. It is a *correspondial vision* of the *current state of humanity*, which is defined by a "deep self-love and rejection of the Lord". The positive NDE accounts may be "biased towards the message," in that they are experienced by those "capable of delivering this message."  
* **Hell as Gravitation:** Hell is not a *judgment* or a place of punishment one is "thrown into". Rather, it is a *state* that one *gravitates towards* based on one's "deepest loves". When those loves are forms of *proprium* (self-love) —such as the "faith alone" dogma—they "actively cut off the divine" and lead to that hellish state.

## **VI. Conclusion: An Integrated Analysis**

The analysis of testimonial, cross-cultural, and theological data provides a nuanced, synthesized answer.

1. **The "Pure" Element:** The "pure" component is the *core experience* itself. The robust, prospective data from Van Lommel and the "cultural priming" test by Greyson argue strongly against simple physiological or cultural projection. The "ineffable" (indescribable) nature of the event and the powerful data from the "Unexpected Jesus" testimonies suggest a genuine, transcendent phenomenon.  
2. **The "Identification" Element:** The identification of this "Being of Light" as "Jesus" is *not* a "cultural label." It is a **pure identification based on a direct personality match**. The unique personality of the "Being of Light" (unconditional love, non-judgmental) is a *perfect correspondence* to the "Divine Human" of the Gospels.  
3. **Final Thesis:** The identification of Jesus in NDEs is a *pure identification of a pure experience*. The experiencer, regardless of background, has a "pure" encounter with the "sun in heaven" (the "Being of Light"). They then experience an "innate knowing" that this specific, unique personality *is* the "Divine Human in ultimates," Jesus Christ.  
4. **Answering the "Supersedes Dogma" Clause:** The report's final and most significant conclusion is that this experience *absolutely* "supersedes religious dogma." The "Dogma Paradox" is the key finding. The raw *experience* of unconditional love is so powerful that it overrides the experiencer's prior dogmatic beliefs about judgment , hell , and exclusivity. The NDE-Jesus is not a product *of* dogma; it is an experience that *corrects* dogma.
