# **The Two Hearts of Creation: A Comparative Analysis of Primordial Narratives and a Philosophical Re-evaluation of the Cognitive Science of Religion**

## **Part I: The Primordial Matrix: Common Motifs in ANE and Hebrew Cosmogony**

The creation narratives of the Hebrew Bible, particularly the opening chapters of Genesis, did not emerge in a cultural or literary vacuum. Scholarly consensus, supported by a century of archaeological and textual discoveries, affirms that these accounts are the Israelite inheritors of a vast and ancient literary tradition from the Ancient Near East. This shared heritage is not evidence of simple borrowing but of participation in a common, region-wide cultural conversation about cosmic origins. By examining the structural and thematic grammar common to both Mesopotamian and Hebrew thought, one can discern a shared primordial matrix from which two profoundly different theological and philosophical paths would diverge.  
A detailed comparison between the first creation account in Genesis (Genesis 1:1–2:4a) and the Babylonian creation epic, the *Enuma Elish*, reveals a common structural template, suggesting a shared conceptual framework for imagining the act of creation. Both narratives begin with a similar primordial state: a formless, watery chaos. In the *Enuma Elish*, this chaos is personified as the primordial deities Apsu (freshwater) and Tiamat (saltwater). In Genesis 1:2, this state is described with the Hebrew term *tehom*, or "the deep," an inert, watery abyss over which the spirit of God moves. From this initial state, both accounts proceed through a remarkably similar sequence of creative acts: the emergence of light, the creation of a "firmament" or "expanse" to separate the primordial waters into upper and lower realms, the appearance of dry land, the creation of celestial bodies to mark time, and finally, the creation of humanity. Both narratives also conclude with a period of divine rest or celebration after the work of creation is deemed complete.  
It is precisely within these similarities, however, that the most critical divergence becomes apparent. This divergence is a deliberate act of demythologization that functions as a profound theological argument. While the Hebrew word *tehom* is linguistically cognate with the Babylonian *Tiamat*, its narrative and ontological function has been radically transformed. In the *Enuma Elish*, Tiamat is a divine being—an active, personified, and ultimately malevolent cosmic force that must be violently conquered and subdued by the hero-god Marduk for creation to occur. In Genesis, the *tehom* is stripped of all personality and divine status. It is rendered as an impersonal, non-divine, and inert substance—simply water—which God effortlessly organizes by divine command. The biblical author, living in a world saturated with these combat myths, makes a conscious choice to use a familiar term but to empty it of its mythological content. This is not a battle; it is an act of sovereign ordering.  
This intellectual move establishes a fundamental ontological hierarchy that defines the entire biblical worldview: there is God (the singular, uncreated Creator), and then there is everything else (the plural, created cosmos). In the Babylonian model, the gods and the elements of the world exist on a continuum of divine substance. In Genesis, a radical, unbridgeable distinction is drawn between the Creator and the creation. This philosophical re-categorization of reality is the foundational premise of the "heart of unity" and precedes all subsequent creative acts.  
**Table 1: Structural and Thematic Comparison of *Enuma Elish* and Genesis 1**

| Feature | *Enuma Elish* (The Heart of Division) | Genesis 1 (The Heart of Unity) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primordial State** | A divine, active, and chaotic watery abyss personified by warring gods (Apsu and Tiamat). | An impersonal, inert, and non-divine watery abyss (*tehom*) over which God's spirit hovers. |
| **Nature of Deity** | Polytheistic pantheon; gods are born, procreate, and are subject to conflict and death. | A single, pre-existent, transcendent Creator (Elohim); no theogony or divine rivals. |
| **Creative Mechanism** | Theomachy (war of the gods); creation is a violent byproduct of conflict and the dismemberment of a divine corpse. | Divine fiat; creation occurs through effortless, unopposed speech ("And God said..."). |
| **Source of Order** | Order is violently imposed upon a chaotic divine substance by a victorious god (Marduk). | Order is inherent in the will of the Creator and is systematically established through acts of separation and blessing. |
| **Status of Humanity** | Created from the blood of a vanquished, rebellious god (Kingu) to be slaves for the victorious gods. | Created in the "image and likeness of God"; the apex of creation, given stewardship ("dominion") over the earth. |

## **Part II: The Heart of Division: Theogony, Conflict, and Creation in the *Enuma Elish***

The *Enuma Elish* serves as the archetype of a cosmological vision rooted in division, conflict, and immanence. It is not a pure creation story (*cosmogony*) but a political epic that repurposes older mythological materials to serve a specific ideological function. Its narrative logic is best understood as an act of **mythic bricolage**, a concept from the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss describing the process of constructing a new narrative from the "remains and debris" of older events and stories. The Babylonian scribes inherited a core structure from earlier Sumerian "dragon-slaying" myths, such as the combat between the god Ninurta and the monster Anzu, in which a younger hero-god defeats a chaotic entity to establish order and supremacy. These pre-existing conflict motifs were assembled into a new epic with a clear political goal: to legitimize the historical rise of the city of Babylon and the elevation of its patron deity, Marduk, to the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon, supplanting older cult centers like Nippur (seat of Enlil).  
The driving force of the narrative is not a primordial desire to create, but rather a series of violent internal conflicts within the divine family. The story is propelled by the twin engines of theogony (the birth of the gods) and theomachy (the war of the gods). Creation begins with the sexual union of Apsu and Tiamat, whose mingling waters produce subsequent generations of deities. The universe is thus initially populated by a growing family of divine beings, not by inert matter. The plot then unfolds through two cycles of intergenerational violence. First, the noise of the younger gods disturbs Apsu, who plots their annihilation, only to be murdered himself by his clever great-grandson, Ea. This act of patricide then incites Tiamat to wage a war of vengeance against the younger gods, a war that culminates in her own defeat and death at the hands of her great-great-grandson, Marduk.  
Within this framework, the creation of the cosmos is a violent and almost incidental afterthought. Order is not spoken into existence from a transcendent source; it is brutally imposed upon the defeated forces of chaos. Marduk forms the heavens and the earth by splitting open and dismembering the corpse of his great-grandmother, Tiamat, using one half of her body to form the sky as a roof to hold back her upper waters. The very structure of the world is thus born from a matricidal act. The creation of humanity is similarly rooted in violence and grim pragmatism. Humans are fashioned from the blood of Tiamat's vanquished general and consort, the rebel god Kingu. Their sole purpose for existence is to serve as slaves, performing the manual labor of the cosmos to relieve the victorious gods of their toil.  
This narrative logic has profound ontological consequences. In the *Enuma Elish*, creation is secondary to divinity. The gods exist first, and the world is merely a rearrangement of divine substance—Tiamat's body and Kingu's blood. This means the cosmos is not fundamentally separate from the gods; in a very real sense, it *is* the gods, reconfigured into a new form. This worldview lacks the radical Creator/Creation distinction that is the cornerstone of Genesis. Because the material of the world is divine in origin, the elements of nature—the sky, the earth, the sea—are not just inert things. They are the remnants of divine beings and thus retain a measure of divine power and personality. This provides the philosophical justification for nature worship, astrology, and polytheism. The "heart of division" is therefore a cosmological principle where divinity itself is fragmented, embattled, and scattered throughout the material world.

## **Part III: The Heart of Unity: Sovereignty, Order, and Creation in Genesis**

The first chapter of Genesis can be understood as a sophisticated theological and philosophical counter-narrative, a deliberate polemic that systematically dismantles the "heart of division" and articulates a radical vision of unity, order, and transcendent sovereignty. The narrative begins with a single, pre-existent God, referred to by the title "Elohim." There is no divine family, no procreation, no rivals, and therefore no possibility of theogony or theomachy. God creates through effortless, unopposed speech—the divine fiat "And God said...". The repetitive, liturgical structure of the six days, with its recurring refrains of "And it was so" and "And there was evening and there was morning," emphasizes a calm, orderly, and meticulously controlled process, the very antithesis of the chaotic, violent struggle at the heart of the *Enuma Elish*.  
This polemic is most evident in the way the narrative treats elements that were deified in neighboring ANE cultures. The sun, moon, and stars, which were widely worshipped as powerful astral deities, are presented in Genesis as mere "lights" or "luminaries" created by God on the fourth day. Their purpose is not to rule destinies but to serve mundane functions: to separate day from night and to be signs for seasons, days, and years. The great sea monsters, the *tanninim*, whose name is cognate with the chaos monsters of Canaanite and Mesopotamian myth, are not primordial foes to be vanquished. Instead, they are simply creatures made by God on the fifth day, and, like all other living things, they are blessed by Him. This act of demythologization systematically subjugates all potential divine rivals, re-categorizing them as parts of a unified, created order under a single sovereign.  
The theology of Genesis 1 did not appear *ex nihilo*. It represents the crystallization of a long-standing West Semitic tradition of a supreme creator deity, El. In texts from the ancient city of Ugarit, El is the titular head of the pantheon, the father of the gods, and holds epithets such as "Creator of Creatures" and "Possessor of Heaven and Earth". While El was often a remote figure in the myths (*deus otiosus*, or "idle god"), the conceptual seed of a single, ultimate creative source was present in the cultural milieu. The Hebrew authors syncretized the attributes of this high creator god with their national God, Yahweh, and elevated the concept to one of absolute, exclusive, and radical monotheism. Genesis 1 is the ultimate literary expression of this theological evolution, presenting a God who is not merely the chief of the gods, but the sole and transcendent source of all being.  
This unified vision culminates in the creation of humanity. In stark contrast to the Babylonian view of humans as slaves born of a rebel god's blood, humanity in Genesis is the apex of God's creative work. Created in the "image and likeness of God," humans are endowed with inherent dignity and a unique purpose. They are not created to serve the needs of the divine, but are blessed and given a mandate of responsible stewardship—"dominion"—over the created order, establishing a covenantal, rather than servile, relationship between the Creator and humanity.  
The "heart of unity" articulated in Genesis is therefore not just a numerical claim (one God instead of many) but a profound philosophical claim about the nature of reality itself. Where the *Enuma Elish* presents a world born from a primordial conflict between opposing principles, meaning that division and moral ambiguity are woven into the fabric of existence, Genesis posits that reality is fundamentally coherent, orderly, and good because it originates from a single, rational, and benevolent source. The repeated refrain, "And God saw that it was good," is a direct polemical statement against the ANE worldview. It asserts that the created order is not the morally ambiguous byproduct of a cosmic war but is intrinsically good because its source is good. This worldview lays the foundation for a different kind of ethics and, arguably, a different approach to knowledge. If the cosmos is fundamentally orderly and rational, it can be understood and investigated. If it is the product of capricious, warring gods, it is fundamentally unpredictable and must be navigated through magic and appeasement. The "heart of unity" is the philosophical prerequisite for a worldview in which both a coherent theology and a systematic science are possible.

## **Part IV: Re-evaluating the Cognitive Science of Religion: A Philosophical Critique**

Pivoting from ancient texts to modern scientific inquiry, the dominant paradigm in the Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) offers a naturalistic explanation for the origins of belief. According to the standard model of CSR, religion is not an evolutionary adaptation in itself but is rather an incidental byproduct, or "spandrel," of other cognitive faculties that evolved for more mundane survival purposes. Key among these mechanisms are the Hypersensitive Agency Detection Device (HADD), a cognitive bias that predisposes humans to infer the presence of agents behind ambiguous natural events; a strong propensity for teleological reasoning, which attributes purpose and design to natural phenomena; and deeply ingrained intuitions about mind-body dualism.  
However, a critical analysis reveals that CSR is not a philosophically neutral scientific enterprise. It operates from an unstated, *a priori* commitment to **metaphysical materialism**—the philosophical position that all of reality is composed solely of matter and energy, and that all phenomena, including consciousness, mind, and belief, are exclusively the results of material interactions within the brain. This is a form of philosophical monism that, by definition, excludes the possibility of any non-material or supernatural reality. Consequently, CSR's methodology is inherently reductionist. It is not designed to ask *if* a non-material reality might exist, but rather to explain *why* the material brain produces what it assumes to be the "illusion" of one. Its conclusions are therefore powerfully shaped, if not entirely pre-determined, by its founding philosophical assumptions.  
The claim that CSR is "religiously neutral" is therefore untenable. By adopting materialism as its unquestioned ontology, CSR necessarily frames religious belief not as a potential perception of a deeper reality, but as a cognitive error, a misfiring of faculties designed for other tasks. This is not a neutral scientific stance but a deeply partisan philosophical one, rooted in the historical "materialism controversy" of the 19th century, which pitted new scientific discoveries against traditional religious worldviews.  
The central flaw in applying CSR as a totalizing explanation for religion is a category error: it consistently confuses the *neurological vehicle* of a belief with the *philosophical validity* of that belief's content. CSR successfully identifies cognitive mechanisms, like HADD, that are undoubtedly active when people form religious beliefs. This is the neurological vehicle. However, it then makes a philosophical leap, concluding that because the belief is produced by a natural, evolved mechanism, the content of the belief—for example, the actual existence of God—must be an illusion. This is a non-sequitur. All of our beliefs, including the belief in metaphysical materialism itself, are processed through the same evolved cognitive architecture. If one were to apply CSR's reductionist logic to its own premises, the belief in materialism would also have to be dismissed as a byproduct of cognitive mechanisms that are not necessarily "truth-tracking". The argument thus becomes self-refuting. The real question is not whether our brains are involved in belief—of course they are—but whether those beliefs can correspond to an external reality. CSR, by its materialist presupposition, rules out this possibility for religion from the start, making it a closed philosophical loop rather than an open scientific inquiry.

## **Part V: The Ghost in the Machine: Why CSR Better Explains Polytheism than Monotheism**

A deeper critique reveals that the standard model of CSR, while claiming to explain "religion" universally, provides a far more powerful cognitive model for the "heart of division" (polytheism) than it does for the "heart of unity" (monotheism). Its primary proposed mechanism, the Hypersensitive Agency Detection Device (HADD), is a cognitive engine that naturally generates a polytheistic worldview. HADD is an evolutionary strategy that defaults to assuming agency behind ambiguous events—the rustle in the grass is more safely assumed to be a predator than the wind. This cognitive bias, when extrapolated to the broader environment, naturally populates the world with a multitude of unseen, localized agents: the spirit of the river, the spirit of the forest, the god of the storm, the ghost of an ancestor. It provides a direct cognitive foundation for animism and for what is sometimes called "hard polytheism," the belief in multiple, distinct, and independent divine sources. HADD is, in essence, the cognitive expression of the "heart of division."  
From this perspective, radical monotheism of the kind articulated in Genesis 1 represents a profound cognitive anomaly for the standard CSR model. The cognitive leap to monotheism is not simply a quantitative reduction in the number of gods from many to one. It is a qualitative revolution that requires a fundamental cognitive override of the HADD default. It demands the active **suppression** of the intuition to attribute agency to every localized natural phenomenon and the simultaneous **unification** of all causal power into a single, abstract, and transcendent source. This unified source, the God of Genesis, is cognitively far more difficult and abstract than the immanent, person-like agents of polytheism. This God is non-corporeal, exists outside of space and time, and acts through abstract command rather than direct physical interaction.  
The theological distinction between monotheism and polytheism is therefore not merely a cultural preference but reflects two fundamentally different cognitive operations. Polytheism represents the path of least cognitive resistance, as it aligns with and gives narrative structure to the brain's default, HADD-driven output of perceiving multiple agents in the world. Monotheism, conversely, is a path of high cognitive resistance. It requires a sophisticated act of abstraction and conceptual unification that runs directly counter to our most basic, evolved intuitions.  
This presents a critical weakness in CSR's claim to be a universal theory of religion. It may have provided a plausible explanation for the cognitive origins of *polytheism* and animism. However, to explain the emergence of monotheism, it is insufficient to simply state that "HADD made us believe in God." CSR must account for the powerful cognitive and cultural forces that led a particular group of people to systematically *reject* the default output of their HADD in favor of a much more cognitively costly and abstract concept. By failing to adequately address this "hard problem," the standard model reveals its limitations, explaining one form of religious thought far better than another.

## **Part VI: The Forgotten Alternative: *Urmonotheismus* and the Anthropological Evidence for "High God" Beliefs**

The evolutionary assumptions underlying much of CSR are not new; they are the intellectual descendants of the classical 19th-century evolutionary model of religion, which posited a unilinear progression from "primitive" animism, through polytheism, to the "advanced" stage of monotheism. However, this model was challenged from its inception by an alternative theory grounded in ethnographic evidence. The Scottish folklorist Andrew Lang was among the first to question this linear progression. Analyzing reports from missionaries and ethnographers, he discovered that many of the most technologically "primitive" societies (such as the Indigenous peoples of Australia and Tierra del Fuego) held a belief in a single, eternal, moral, creator God. This "High God" was often a *deus otiosus*—a remote deity who created the world and established its moral laws before withdrawing from its day-to-day affairs, leaving lesser spirits and ancestral ghosts as the focus of daily ritual. Lang argued that this belief was not a late development or a borrowing from Christianity, but could represent a primordial human intuition, arising from a simple but profound conjecture about the ultimate "maker of things".  
This hypothesis was later systematized by the Austrian Catholic priest and ethnologist Father Wilhelm Schmidt into the grand theory of "Primitive Monotheism," or *Urmonotheismus*. In his monumental 12-volume work, *Der Ursprung der Gottesidee* (*The Origin of the Idea of God*), Schmidt amassed a vast body of ethnographic data to argue that monotheism was the *Urreligion*, the original religion of humankind. In his view, polytheism, animism, and magic were not early stages in an evolutionary ascent but were later **degenerations** or corruptions of this pure, original monotheistic belief.  
Schmidt's work has been rightly criticized for its clear theological agenda and its methodologically flawed "culture circle" (*Kulturkreis*) theory, which attempted to trace the diffusion of cultural traits in a overly schematic way. However, to dismiss his entire project because of these flaws is to commit a category error. The vast ethnographic data he collected, documenting widespread "High God" beliefs among hunter-gatherer societies, remains a significant and unresolved challenge to simplistic evolutionary models of religion.  
**Table 2: Contrasting Explanatory Models of Religious Origins**

| Feature | Classical Evolutionary Model (Tylor) | CSR Byproduct Model | Lang/Schmidt Degeneration Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primordial Belief** | Animism (belief in spirits). | None (religion is a byproduct, not a starting point). | Monotheism (belief in a single High God). |
| **Primary Mechanism** | Evolution of human consciousness and mistaken inferences about dreams and death. | Misfiring of evolved cognitive modules (e.g., HADD, teleological bias) designed for survival. | Primordial revelation or rational inference, followed by cultural corruption and forgetfulness. |
| **Historical Trajectory** | Simple to Complex: Animism → Polytheism → Monotheism. | Non-Adaptive Emergence: Cognitive biases lead to the recurring invention of "minimally counterintuitive" concepts. | Complex to Simple: Original Monotheism → Degeneration into Polytheism, Animism, and Magic. |

When stripped of its theological dogmatism, the Lang/Schmidt hypothesis offers a compelling cognitive alternative for the origin of the "heart of unity." It suggests that the human mind may possess an innate capacity for conceptual unification and abstract causal reasoning that is co-equal with, or perhaps even prior to, the fragmenting, agent-detecting mechanisms of HADD. The widespread belief in a *deus otiosus* provides a potential bridge between these two cognitive modes. The primordial intuition may indeed be of a single, unified Creator—the "Maker of things." However, this being is abstract, remote, and offers little in the way of immediate, practical interaction. In contrast, the more evolutionarily pragmatic HADD mechanism populates the immediate environment with accessible, immanent spirits that can be appeased, manipulated, or avoided. Over time, the focus of practical, daily worship shifts to these lesser beings, and the original High God is "forgotten" or relegated to a position of irrelevance.  
This suggests a new, synthetic model. Religion does not necessarily evolve linearly from polytheism to monotheism, nor does it simply degenerate from a pure monotheism. Rather, human cognition may possess two competing, fundamental religious impulses from its very beginning: a **unifying, philosophical impulse** to seek a single, ultimate cause (the cognitive source of the "heart of unity"), and a **fragmenting, agent-detecting impulse** to identify multiple, immediate causes (the cognitive source of the "heart of division"). The complex history of religion is the story of the perpetual tension and interplay between these two powerful modes of thought.

## **Part VII: Conclusion: Toward a New Synthesis**

The analysis of the *Enuma Elish* and the Genesis creation account reveals two divergent paths emerging from a common primordial matrix. These paths are animated by fundamentally different principles: a "heart of division" and a "heart of unity." The *Enuma Elish* stands as the archetype of the former, articulating a worldview where creation is the violent byproduct of divine conflict, order is imposed through dismemberment, and divinity is fragmented and immanent within the material cosmos. Genesis 1, in stark contrast, is the archetype of the latter, presenting a sophisticated polemic for a reality born from the unopposed will of a single, transcendent Creator, resulting in a cosmos that is unified, orderly, and intrinsically good.  
The modern Cognitive Science of Religion, constrained by its unexamined philosophical commitment to metaphysical materialism, offers a plausible cognitive model for the "heart ofdivision." Its central mechanism, the Hypersensitive Agency Detection Device, provides a powerful explanation for the emergence of animistic and polytheistic beliefs by populating the world with a multiplicity of unseen agents. However, CSR fails to adequately account for the cognitive revolution required for the "heart of unity," a leap of abstraction that runs counter to the very cognitive defaults CSR posits as foundational. It can only explain this development by reducing it to a cultural construct, thereby failing to address the unique cognitive work it represents.  
A more robust model emerges when the insights of CSR are placed in dialogue with the forgotten anthropological evidence for "High God" beliefs. This synthesis suggests that the tension between the "heart of division" and the "heart of unity" is not a late historical development but may reflect a primordial dynamic within human cognition itself. It points to the existence of two competing, fundamental impulses: a fragmenting, agent-detecting impulse (the cognitive engine of polytheism) and a unifying, philosophical impulse to seek a single, ultimate cause (the cognitive engine of monotheism).  
The polytheistic path of the *Enuma Elish* represents the triumph of the HADD-driven, fragmenting impulse, shaped and deployed to serve the political necessities of an ascendant empire. The monotheistic path of Genesis represents the deliberate, philosophical, and theological triumph of the unifying impulse, bringing to its ultimate conclusion a long-standing West Semitic intellectual tradition. A truly comprehensive understanding of religion, therefore, requires moving beyond the reductionist limitations of current CSR models. It demands a new interdisciplinary approach that takes seriously the philosophical content of religious ideas and acknowledges the possibility that the human mind is wired not just to detect a world full of agents, but also to seek a coherent, unified understanding of reality—an impulse that finds its most powerful ancient expression in the serene, ordered, and unified cosmos of Genesis 1\.
