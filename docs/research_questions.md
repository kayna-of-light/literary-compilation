# Research Questions

This document tracks open research questions, gaps in analysis, and hypotheses requiring further investigation. Questions are formatted for use with external research tools (NotebookLM, Gemini Deep Research, NDE Statistical Repository).

> **Usage**: Copy the relevant question block (context + question) to the appropriate research tool. Questions are separated by horizontal rules for easy identification.

## How to Add Questions

When identifying a gap or question during framework development:

1. **Classify the domain** — Which thematic area does this question address?
2. **Provide context** — Brief background sufficient for the research tool
3. **State the question clearly** — Specific, answerable research question or hypothesis
4. **Tag the target system** — Which tool is best suited to answer this?

### Target System Tags

| Tag | System | Context Length | Best For |
|-----|--------|----------------|----------|
| `[NLM]` | NotebookLM | Short (~500 chars) | Scholarly sources, theological texts |
| `[GDR]` | Gemini Deep Research | Extended | Web analysis, cross-referencing, synthesis |
| `[NDE]` | NDE Statistical Repository | Variable | Statistical queries on NDE dataset |

### [Domain] Question Title

**Target**: `[NLM]` / `[GDR]` / `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open / In Progress / Resolved  
**Date Added**: YYYY-MM-DD

**Context**:
[Brief background providing necessary context for the research tool. For NotebookLM, keep under 500 characters. For Gemini Deep Research, include fuller detail.]

### [EXAMPLE] Consciousness Studies: NDE Beings of Light Statistical Profile

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Example  
**Date Added**: 2024-12-27

**Context**:
Framework proposes that "beings of light" in NDEs correspond to angelic presences. Need statistical data on frequency, characteristics, and cultural variation of light-being encounters.

**Research Question**:
What percentage of NDEs in the dataset include encounters with beings of light? How do descriptions vary across cultural/religious backgrounds? Is there statistical correlation with reported life transformation?

**Notes**:
Relevant to `01_Consciousness_Studies/` domain. Results would support or challenge the correspondence interpretation.

### [EXAMPLE] Biblical Scholarship: Proto-Luke Passion Narrative Sources

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Example  
**Date Added**: 2024-12-27

**Context**:
Proto-Luke hypothesis suggests a pre-Markan passion source. Klinghardt argues for Marcionite priority. Need scholarly perspectives on passion narrative stratigraphy.

**Research Question**:
What scholarly consensus exists regarding pre-Markan passion narrative sources? How does this relate to the Jamesian protograph hypothesis?

**Notes**:
Cross-reference with `04_Early_Christian_History/The Jamesian Protograph...` documents.

### [EXAMPLE] Mythological Studies: Australian Songline Dating

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Example  
**Date Added**: 2024-12-27

**Context**:
The framework cites Australian Aboriginal songlines as evidence for deep oral tradition durability (potentially 10,000+ years). This supports the "Ancient Word" hypothesis—that a universal symbolic system could persist across millennia through oral transmission. The Dreaming narratives encode geographical, ecological, and cosmological information in stable mythic form.

**Research Question**:
What is the current scientific consensus on the age and stability of Australian Aboriginal songlines? What methodologies (linguistic, archaeological, genetic) have been used to date these traditions? Are there documented cases of songlines preserving information about geological events (sea level changes, volcanic activity) that can be independently verified?

**Notes**:
Results support the plausibility of Swedenborg's "Ancient Word" persisting through oral tradition before diverging into national mythologies. See `06_Mythological_Studies/Echoes of an Ancient Word...`
