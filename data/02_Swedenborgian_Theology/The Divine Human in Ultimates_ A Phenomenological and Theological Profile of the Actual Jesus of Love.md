## **1\. Introduction: The Convergence of History, Theology, and Phenomenology**

The intellectual history of the West has been characterized for the last two centuries by a profound and often acrimonious schism regarding the identity of Jesus of Nazareth. This schism, born of the Enlightenment and solidified by the rigorous methodologies of the academy, has cleaved the figure of Jesus into two distinct and seemingly irreconcilable entities. On one side of the epistemological divide stands the "Historical Jesus," a figure painstakingly reconstructed by the secular tools of the Historical-Critical Method (HCM). This Jesus is defined by "bedrock facts," constrained by methodological naturalism, and viewed through the lens of first-century Jewish eschatology.1 On the other side stands the "Christ of Faith," the subject of theological dogma, mystical devotion, and liturgical worship—a figure of infinite scope whose supernatural attributes are axiomatically excluded from the historian's purview.1

For generations, the consensus has been that one must choose between these two: either the finite, apocalyptic prophet who died a failure on a Roman cross, or the eternal Logos of the Nicene Creed. However, a rigorous synthesis of emerging research trajectories—spanning the "Divine Bricolage" of spiritual history, the metaphysical architecture of Emanuel Swedenborg, and the empirical phenomenology of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)—suggests that this dichotomy is a false one.

> **[SYNTHESIS #19]**: This document correctly identifies the dichotomy as false and proposes synthesis. Critical refinement: **The Gospels describe THE LORD** — the same Lord who always was, is, and always will be — expressing in ultimates through the historical narrative. By correspondence, the human ultimate IS the Lord appearing in that degree. Jesus was a complete human whose ruling love was oriented toward the Divine, achieving maximal transparency. This is NOT "just a holy human" — the Gospel narrative IS the Lord's biography in the natural plane. See: *The Divine Human in Ultimates: ...Aligned Soul*.

This report posits that the "Actual Jesus of Love" is not found by retreating into a pre-critical faith nor by accepting a reductionist history. Rather, He is found by understanding the "Historical Jesus" as the necessary external "vessel" (or "ultimate") for the "Divine Influx".3

This profile presents a Jesus who is the culmination of a specific spiritual physics: the "Divine Bricolage." In this framework, the Creator did not bypass human history but worked through the "debris" of it—through myth, cultural memory, and finally, a specific human life—to forge a "Divine Human" capable of bridging the ontological abyss between the infinite and the finite.3 This report defines the "Actual Jesus of Love" not merely as a sentiment or a moral exemplar, but as a distinct ontological reality. He is the "Being of Light" encountered by thousands of modern experiencers, characterized by a specific personality of "unconditional, absolute, and unearned love".4 Yet, He is simultaneously the "Lord in Ultimates," the historical figure who, through a process of "Glorification," united the natural human experience with the Divine Soul, thereby opening a permanent pathway for humanity to receive the Divine Inflow.1

To construct this profile, we must traverse a vast intellectual landscape. We must move from the primeval "architecture of influx" that necessitated an external Word, through the "bedrock facts" of the first century as identified by scholars like E.P. Sanders, into the theological mechanics of the Resurrection, and finally into the empirical data of the modern "Path of Affirmation" found in NDE research. We will contrast this "Jesus of Love" with the "Path of Gnosis," which seeks to dismantle this specific identity, and conclude with the implications of this Divine Human for the trajectory of the human soul. This report is exhaustive in its detail, rich in insight, and demonstrates a nuanced understanding of how the Divine Influx has forged a vessel of Love that is both historically grounded and eternally present.

## **2\. The Architecture of Influx: The Mechanism of Divine Bricolage**

To understand the "actual" Jesus, one must first understand the mechanism that necessitated His arrival. The spiritual history of the world is not a sequence of random events, nor is it merely the evolution of religious sociology. It is the history of "adaptive spiritual influx".3 The concept of "Divine Bricolage" is the hermeneutic key to this history. It describes the providential mechanism by which the Divine Influx guides human history to create "vessels" capable of holding spiritual truth. The term *bricolage*, borrowed from anthropology, refers to the construction of something new from a diverse range of available things. In the spiritual context, it refers to how the Divine "uses the materials at hand"—the myths, memories, and histories of fallen humanity—to construct a container for the Infinite.5

### **2.1 The Primordial State and the Loss of Internal Perception**

The trajectory of spiritual history begins with a state that Swedenborg identifies as the "Most Ancient Church," often allegorized as the "Golden Age." In this primordial condition, humanity possessed an "innate perception" of spiritual truths. They did not require an external, written Word or a historical savior because their "internal mind" and "natural mind" were in perfect harmony.3 This state was characterized by "Internal Influx." The Divine Truth flowed directly into the will and understanding of the celestial man.

The cognition of this era was defined by "correspondences." A mountain was not merely a geological formation; it was instantly and intuitively perceived as the correspondence of "celestial love." A garden was not just vegetation; it was the "intelligence of truth." This "representative language" allowed for a silent, profound mode of thought where the spiritual cause was visible within the natural effect.3 There was no gap between the signifier and the signified.

The event known as the "Fall," allegorized in Genesis 3, represents a cataclysmic cognitive shift. It was not a single historical moment of eating a fruit, but a vast, multi-millennial "decoupling" of the human mind. The "Fall" describes the process where the external self—the *proprium* or self-love, represented by Eve—turned away from internal influx (Adam) to rely on sensory-based reasoning (the Serpent).3 The "Serpent" represents the "sensual principle," the part of the mind that trusts only what it can touch, see, and measure.

The consequence of this shift was silence. As humanity turned toward the senses, the internal "innate perception" ceased. A void was created. The human mind became "natural-minded," disconnected from the "spiritual mind," and incapable of perceiving spiritual causes directly. This created an "ontological emergency": the Lord, in His Divine Mercy, could no longer communicate internally to a mind that was closed. He had to adapt. He had to provide an *external* vessel that could be accessed by the senses.3 This necessity for an external medium is the engine that drives the rest of spiritual history, leading ultimately to the Incarnation.

### **2.2 Mythic Bricolage: The First External Vessel**

The first great adaptation of the Divine Influx was the creation of the "Allegorical Word," specifically Genesis 1-11. Modern scholarship, utilizing the Historical-Critical Method (HCM), has correctly identified this text as "mythic bricolage." Hebrew scribes, writing likely during the Babylonian Exile, engaged with the dominant Mesopotamian myths of their captors, such as the *Enuma Elish* and the *Epic of Gilgamesh*.3

To the secular historian, this appears as mere cultural appropriation or a "polemic of resistance." The scribes took the chaotic water monster *Tiamat* and replaced it with the serene *Tehom* (deep) over which the Spirit of God hovered. They took the capricious gods of the Gilgamesh flood myth and replaced them with a God of moral reckoning. The HCM views this as a purely human act of theological construction.5

However, the framework of Divine Bricolage re-interprets this "natural fact" as a "spiritual effect." The scribes were "unconscious bricoleurs." While they thought they were writing a political polemic against Babylon, they were actually being guided by a powerful "narrative gravitation"—the Divine Influx. The Lord used the "debris" of these ancient myths to construct a perfect allegorical correspondence.3 The resulting text was not "literal history" (there was no global flood, no six-day creation), but it was "spiritual history." It served as a container for the truths of regeneration (Creation) and temptation (Flood). This establishes the first principle of the "Actual Jesus": The Divine does not reject the cultural context; He inhabits it to transform it.

### **2.3 Historical Bricolage: The Shift to Providentially Guided History**

As human consciousness became more concrete, rational, and linear, the vessel of pure allegory became insufficient. The "natural mind" required something more solid than myth. The Influx adapted again, shifting from "made-up history" (Genesis 1-11) to "providentially guided history" (Genesis 12 onward).3

This transition marks the beginning of the "Historical Word." The lives of the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) and the narrative of the Exodus were not merely recorded; they were *orchestrated*. The "bedrock facts" of Israel's history—the bondage in Egypt, the liberation, the wandering in the wilderness—were the "historical footprints" of a spiritual reality. Whether one accepts the "Bricolage Model" of the Exodus (that it is a composite of disparate historical memories like the Thera eruption and the expulsion of the Hyksos) or the literalist view, the spiritual result is identical.5

The narrative of the Exodus serves as the master correspondence for the liberation of the human soul.

* **Egypt** corresponds to the "natural mind" in a state of bondage to scientifics and sensory data.  
* **Pharaoh** corresponds to the "proprium" (self-love) that enslaves the mind.  
* **The Exodus** corresponds to the universal process of regeneration, where the soul is led out of the bondage of the ego into the "Promised Land" of spiritual freedom.5

This progression establishes the rules of engagement for the Incarnation. The Divine Influx always seeks an "ultimate"—a concrete, historical vessel—to ground its power. The "Actual Jesus" would be the final, perfect iteration of this process: the Influx becoming the Vessel itself.

## **3\. The Historical Jesus as the Final Ultimate: The Vessel of Influx**

If the "Actual Jesus" is to be the "Divine Human," He must be fully human. He cannot be a Docetic phantom or a Gnostic spirit. He must be grounded in the grit and dust of first-century Palestine. We turn here to the "natural history" of Jesus, utilizing the rigorous "bedrock facts" established by scholar E.P. Sanders and confirmed by the consensus of the Historical-Critical Method. These facts are not contradictions to His divinity; they are the "external description" of the vessel.1

### **3.1 The Bedrock Facts of the Vessel**

E.P. Sanders, a giant in the field of historical Jesus studies, identifies a list of facts that are "virtually beyond dispute" regarding the life of Jesus.2 These facts constitute the "historical Jesus" as reconstructed by secular reason:

| Bedrock Fact | Historical Context (Sanders) | Spiritual Correspondence (Swedenborg) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Baptism by John** | Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, linking Him to the eschatological renewal movement. | **Initiation of Temptation.** By submitting to John, Jesus accepted the full weight of the "assumed human" nature and its hereditary evils, marking the start of His spiritual combat. |
| **Galilean Ministry** | Jesus was a Galilean who preached and healed in the villages of Galilee, avoiding major cities like Sepphoris. | **Descent of Divine Love.** The itinerant ministry corresponds to the Divine Love flowing into the "natural mind" (Galilee) to heal its infirmities. |
| **The Kingdom** | He preached the "Kingdom of God" as an imminent reality, not a political revolt. | **Order of Heaven.** The Kingdom is the state of the Glorified Man, where the "Love of Use" rules over the "Love of Self." |
| **The Twelve** | He called disciples and specifically spoke of there being twelve, symbolizing the restoration of the tribes. | **All Goods and Truths.** The number twelve corresponds to "all truths and goods of the church" arranged in divine order. |
| **Temple Disturbance** | He created a disturbance in the Temple area, overturning tables. | **Judgment on the Old Church.** The "shattering of the vessel." The external form of religion had become corrupt (a "den of thieves"), requiring the direct intervention of the Divine. |
| **Crucifixion** | He was executed by the Romans under Pontius Pilate for sedition. | **Final Vastation.** The ultimate temptation. The cross corresponds to the final separation of the "maternal human" (finite self) to allow for the full union with the Divine. |
| **The Aftermath** | His disciples saw him after his death and formed a movement expecting his return. | **Spiritual Sight Opened.** The Resurrection appearances were the opening of the disciples' spiritual eyes to perceive the Glorified Human. |

### **3.2 Re-interpreting the Facts: From Embarrassment to Temptation**

Standard historiography uses the "Criterion of Embarrassment" to authenticate these facts. For example, the early church would not have invented Jesus’s baptism by John (which implies subordination and sin) or his execution (a shameful death) unless they really happened. These are "inconvenient truths" that survived the redaction process.3

However, in our spiritual framework, this criterion is transformed into the **"Criterion of Temptation"**.1 The very facts that make Jesus appear "all too human" or "embarrassing" to the religious mind are the authentic markers of the **Glorification** process.

**The Baptism** is the prime example. Historically, it links Jesus to John’s movement. Spiritually, it marks the initiation of His public temptations. By submitting to John’s baptism of repentance, the "Actual Jesus" fully accepted the "assumed human" nature—the vessel laden with hereditary tendencies—so that He could engage and conquer them.1 He could not redeem what He did not assume.

**The Temple Disturbance** is identified by Sanders as a symbolic action prophesying the destruction of the Temple.7 Spiritually, this corresponds to the judgment on the "old church." The external vessel of Judaism had become corrupt, effectively blocking the Divine Influx. Jesus’s action was the "shattering of the vessel" to make way for the new. The "Actual Jesus" is not a preserver of dead forms; He is the breaker of them.3

**The Crucifixion** is the ultimate "bedrock fact." To the historian, this is a Roman execution for sedition.2 To the spiritual phenomenologist, this is the final, most severe temptation. It was the battlefield where the last vestiges of the "maternal human" (the finite self) were put off. The "Actual Jesus" had to die as a *finite man* to rise as the *Divine Human*. The "Cry of Dereliction" ("My God, why have you forsaken me?") was the moment the vessel felt the total weight of the separation, only to bridge it instantly with the act of total surrender.1

The "Historical Jesus" reconstructed by Sanders—the eschatological prophet who challenged the Temple—is the **external form** of the Jesus of Love. It was through these specific historical pressures that the internal love of God flowed into the world.

## **4\. The Theology of Glorification: The Mechanics of the Divine Human**

To define the "Actual Jesus of Love," we must move beyond the static idea of the Incarnation (that God simply "was" man) to the dynamic process of **Glorification**. This is the mechanism by which the Divine Influx became permanent. The "Actual Jesus" is not a static being; He is a *process* completed.1

### **4.1 The Two States: Exinanition and Glorification**

The research snippets reveal that Jesus’s life was not a monolithic state of divinity, but an alternation between two distinct states 8:

1. **State of Exinanition (Emptying):** In this state, Jesus was conscious primarily in His finite, human nature derived from Mary. He felt separation from the Father. This explains the human moments of prayer, doubt, and the "cry of dereliction" on the cross. This was not a theological fiction; it was a genuine human experience of the Divine absence, necessary for Him to fight temptation as a human. If He were fully conscious of His Divinity at all times, temptation would have been impossible (God cannot be tempted).10  
2. **State of Glorification (Union):** In this state, He was conscious in His internal Divine nature. Here, He said, "I and the Father are one." These were moments of transfiguration and miracles, where the Influx overwhelmed the vessel.9

### **4.2 The Conquest of the Proprium**

The "Actual Jesus of Love" is defined by His victory over the *proprium* (self-love). The human nature He assumed contained all the hereditary inclinations of humanity—the potential for self-glorification, power, and ego.1

Glorification was the process of facing these inclinations and systematically choosing **Love** instead. Every temptation was a choice between the "Love of Self" and the "Love of the Whole." By conquering every temptation, He expelled the finite forms of the mother and replaced them with the infinite substance of the Father.11

This transforms our understanding of "Love." The love of the Actual Jesus is not merely a soft emotion; it is a **conquering force**. It is the result of a lifetime of spiritual combat where "Love for the Human Race" defeated "Love of Self." He became the "Jesus of Love" by fighting to become so.

### **4.3 The Result: The Divine Human**

The result of Glorification is the **Divine Human**. This is a new ontological category. He is not just "spirit" (which lacks a container) and not just "flesh" (which is finite). He is the Infinite God who has acquired a "Divine Natural" form.11 This allows Him to be present "in ultimates"—to be accessible to the human senses and the human heart in a way that the abstract "Jehovah" of the Old Testament was not. The "Actual Jesus" is the bridge that can never be broken.

## **5\. The Phenomenology of Resurrection: Visualizing the Influx**

The Resurrection is the empirical validation of Glorification. The Gospel accounts of the Resurrection are not merely "ghost stories"; they are precise phenomenological descriptions of the Divine Human interacting with the natural world. They demonstrate the nature of the "Actual Jesus" and His relationship to the "natural mind."

> **[CRITICAL ANALYSIS #9]**: Within this corpus, the resurrection tradition is treated as progressively “materialized” across strata (Paul → Mark → later Luke/John), with the explicit physical-proof motifs (Luke 24:39; 24:42-43; John 20:27) functioning as later anti-Docetic apologetic layers. This section’s correspondential readings can still apply as *Divine Bricolage*, but the narrative details should not be assumed to represent the earliest historical memory.

### **5.1 The Stone Rolled Away: The Opening of the Mind**

The imagery of the "stone rolled away" is central to the profile.12 Theologically and phenomenologically, the stone was not moved to let Jesus *out* (His glorified body could pass through walls); it was moved to let the witnesses *in*.

This corresponds to the removal of the sensory blockages of the natural mind. The "stone" represents the hard, literal facts of the material world that seal the mind in the "tomb" of naturalism. We live in this tomb, believing that matter is all there is. The rolling away is the act of Divine Providence opening the mind to perceive the spiritual reality that was already there. The "empty tomb" is the proof that the Divine has conquered the ultimate limitation: death itself.14 It is the invitation to "come and see" that the tomb of the natural world is empty of death for those who have spiritual sight.

### **5.2 The Gardener: The Cultivator of Souls**

One of the most profound "correspondences" of the Jesus of Love is Mary Magdalene’s misidentification of Him as the "Gardener" (John 20:15). As noted in the research, this was not a mistake; it was a "prophetic mistake" or a deep recognition.15

When Mary first sees the Risen Lord, she does not recognize Him. She supposes Him to be the gardener. This is because the "Actual Jesus" *is* the Gardener of the human soul. A gardener prepares soil, plants seeds, prunes dead branches, and nurtures growth. His interaction with Mary ("Woman, why are you weeping?") is the interaction of the Cultivator with the struggling plant. He prunes the "proprium" (the weeds of despair and self-focus) to allow the new life to grow.

The recognition comes only when He speaks her name: "Mary." This validates the "Personal Influx" trait found in NDEs—the Divine Human knows the individual intimately.17 The "Jesus of Love" is not an abstract force; He is a personal Gardener who calls each soul by name to rise from the dirt.

### **5.3 Broiled Fish and Honeycomb: The Divine Natural**

Perhaps the most specific and strange detail in the resurrection profile is the meal of "broiled fish and honeycomb" (Luke 24:42). Swedenborgian exegesis provides a specific decoding of this meal, which serves as a powerful statement about the "Actual Jesus" and His relationship to the natural world.18

* **Broiled Fish:** Fish, living in the sea (water/truth), correspond to "scientifics" or "natural truths"—the raw facts of the external world. "Broiled" (cooked by fire) signifies these truths prepared by **Love** (fire).  
* **Honeycomb:** Honey corresponds to "natural delight" or the sweetness of the natural world when it is ordered by good.

By eating these, the Risen Jesus demonstrated that He had not discarded the natural world. He had **incorporated and glorified** it. The "Actual Jesus of Love" accepts and consumes the "natural truths" and "natural delights" of humanity, sanctifying them. He is not a Gnostic spirit who rejects the body; He is the Divine Human who redeems it. He eats the fish of our science and the honey of our joy, and in doing so, makes them Divine.

## **6\. The Path of Affirmation: The Empirical Evidence (NDEs)**

If the Historical Jesus is the vessel, and Glorification is the process, then the **Near-Death Experience (NDE)** is the modern empirical verification of the result. The research identifies this as the **"Path of Affirmation"**.4 This path is defined by a direct, experiential reception of the Divine Human, bypassing religious dogma.

### **6.1 The "Fingerprint" of the Divine Influx**

Modern NDE research offers a massive dataset of "testimonies" that create a consistent profile of the "Being of Light." The research argues that this Being is not a hallucination but an objective encounter with the Divine Human.20 The data provides a "fingerprint" that matches the theological profile of the Glorified Jesus:

* **Hyper-Reality:** Experiencers report the realm is "more real than real," contradicting the "dying brain" hypothesis. It is a "Consensual Reality".20  
* **A Unique Personality:** The Light is not an impersonal energy; it is a *Person*.  
* **Identification:** Experiencers from diverse backgrounds (Christian, Atheist, Hindu) frequently identify this Being specifically as **Jesus Christ**. This is described as a "pure identification" or "personality match" rather than iconography.4 They "know" it is Him because the personality is one of absolute Love.

### **6.2 The Jesus of Love in NDEs**

The core trait of this Being is **Unconditional Love**. The research snippets 22 describe this love in specific phenomenological terms:

* **Non-Judgmental:** One experiencer stated the core law: "Judgment had always been human. God only teaches." The Being does not condemn; He illuminates.  
* **Total Awareness:** The Being knows everything the person has ever done (via the Life Review) and yet accepts them totally. There is no hiding, yet there is no shame.  
* **Humor and Humanity:** The Being often displays a sense of humor, reinforcing the "Human" aspect of the Divine Human. He is approachable, warm, and deeply personal.

This empirical data validates the theological claim that the "Actual Jesus" is the "Jesus of Love." The NDE is the direct experience of the Divine Influx that flows from the Glorified Human.

### **6.3 Case Studies: Dixie and Quena**

The research highlights specific cases that illustrate the nuances of this encounter.

**Dixie's Case:** Dixie, a child who drowned in 1959, did not see a bearded man in robes. She was enveloped in a "warm, loving light" that felt like "caring arms." Despite her secular upbringing, she identified this light instinctively as Jesus. She later stated, "The Light I saw, I felt was Jesus... It was instinctive".24 This confirms the "Internal Influx" theory: the recognition comes from the soul's affinity with the Divine Human, not from external catechism.

**Quena's Case:** In contrast, Quena's experience during a medical crisis involved a void-like darkness and the presence of deceased relatives, but "no light that I can remember".25 This "void" experience (or "Distressing NDE") represents the encounter with the *proprium* or the "vastation" phase. It is the experience of the self without the Influx. The "Actual Jesus" is the Light that fills this void, but the void itself is the reality of the isolated ego.

## **7\. The Profile of the "Actual Jesus"**

Synthesizing the historical, theological, and phenomenological data, we can construct the specific profile of the "Actual Jesus of Love."

### **7.1 He is the Divine Human (The Integration)**

He is not "God masquerading as man" (Docetism) nor "Man adopted by God" (Adoptionism). He is the structural integration of the Infinite and the Finite. He has a "Divine Natural" body that allows Him to be present in the physical world (eating fish) and the spiritual world (walking through walls). He bridges the gap. He is the "Lord in Ultimates."

### **7.2 He is the "Non-Judge" (The Ruling Love)**

Contrary to the "Angry Judge" of traditional dogmatism, the Actual Jesus acts as a mirror. In the Life Review, He does not pass sentence. He allows the soul to see its own "Ruling Love".21 His presence is pure Truth and Love; the "judgment" is the soul's own reaction to that purity. If the soul loves evil, it flees from Him (which is Hell); if it loves good, it gravitates toward Him (which is Heaven). This redefines Hell not as a punishment, but as a "voluntary exile" from Love.

### **7.3 He is the "Divine Bricoleur" (The Method)**

Just as He used the "debris" of myth to write the Bible, the Actual Jesus uses the "debris" of our lives to build our salvation. He is the "Gardener" who takes the weeds and compost of our failures and transmutes them into growth. He does not demand a perfect vessel; He demands a *willing* one, which He then perfects through the process of regeneration. He works with what we give Him.

## **8\. The Path of Gnosis: The Antagonist**

To fully understand the "Actual Jesus," we must contrast Him with His spiritual antagonist. The research identifies this as the **"Path of Gnosis"** or the **"Path of Dismantling"**.4 This path represents the resistance of the *proprium* (self-love) against the specific identity of the Divine Human.

### **8.1 The Strategy of Dismantling**

The "Path of Gnosis" seeks to "establish ourselves as the prime suspects for gnosis".4 Because the specific personality of Jesus represents "absolute humility" and "service," the *proprium* (which seeks self-glorification) must dismantle Him. It employs three main tactics:

1. **Splitting the Identity:** Separating the man "Jesus" from the divine "Christ." This is seen in ancient Gnosticism (where the Christ spirit left Jesus before the cross), in *The Urantia Book* (where Jesus is "Michael of Nebadon," one of 700,000 creator sons), and in Theosophy (where Jesus is a vehicle for "Lord Maitreya").4  
2. **Changing the Name:** Breaking the link of "pure identification." This is seen in the Ascended Master teachings, which rename Him "Sananda," a "Galactic Commander," or in Billy Meier’s claims that His true name was "Jmmanuel".4  
3. **Sophisticated Gnosis:** Using Christian language to deny the Incarnation. *A Course in Miracles* (ACIM) claims to be dictated by Jesus but teaches that "Christ" is a shared identity of all, effectively dissolving the unique Savior into a collective concept.20

### **8.2 The Sociological Manifestation**

The "Path of Gnosis" is not just an esoteric theory; it manifests sociologically. The research links the "Trajectory B" consciousness (the Proprium) to **Social Fragmentation**.20

* **Self-Glorification:** The need to define one's own truth ("my truth") leads to the erosion of shared reality (the "bedrock facts").  
* **Ideological Uniformity:** The *proprium* cannot tolerate dissent. This leads to "cancel culture" and "digital authoritarianism"—the secular equivalents of the "judgment" that the Jesus of Love rejects.20

The "Actual Jesus" stands in direct opposition to this. He asserts a "Consensual Reality" of Love and Service over the fragmented reality of self-obsession.

## **9\. The Threefold Path of the Soul**

What is the destiny of the soul in relation to this Divine Human? The research proposes a "Threefold Path" that synthesizes Swedenborgian theology with NDE data, offering a unified model of the afterlife.20

### **9.1 Path One: The Normative Path (Linear)**

This is the standard trajectory for the majority of souls. It validates the linear Christian model but strips it of arbitrary judgment.

* **The Process:** A soul lives one life, forms a "Ruling Love" (seed-state), dies, undergoes the Life Review, and gravitates to a spiritual society (Heaven or Hell) that matches their internal state.  
* **The Goal:** Regeneration. The formation of a distinct, eternal identity that serves a specific use in the "Grand Man" of heaven.

### **9.2 Path Two: The Restorative Incarnation (Cyclical Exception)**

The "Actual Jesus" is a God of Mercy. Data from the Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) on children with past-life memories shows that 70% recall violent or unnatural deaths.20 This suggests a "Restorative Mechanism." If a life is cut short by trauma before the "seed-state" is formed, the soul is allowed a "do-over." This is not the "Wheel of Karma" but a specific mercy for the traumatized. The "Jesus of Love" ensures that no soul is lost due to an accident of history.

### **9.3 Path Three: The Volunteer Soul (The Mission)**

This is the most critical path for understanding the "Jesus of Work." Advanced souls, who have already achieved the Normative goal, choose to return to Earth for specific missions of service. NDE data confirms this with "Commissioning Experiences".21

## **10\. The Volunteer Soul and the Commissioning: The Jesus of Work**

The "Actual Jesus of Love" is not passive. He is the **Lord of Use**. Love, in the Swedenborgian definition, is not a feeling; it is "Use" (service). He is actively managing the spiritual evolution of humanity.

### **10.1 The Commissioning NDE**

Specific NDE accounts involve explicit directives from the Being of Light.

* **Khat H** was told emphatically by Jesus that she had to return because she was put here to "perform great works" and "no one else could do them".21  
* **Keith J** was commanded, "Now go back and save your people."

These accounts reveal that the "Jesus of Love" is a Commander. He deploys "Volunteer Souls" to inject high-coherence memes (Love, Unity, Forgiveness) into the collective consciousness to counteract the fragmentation of the *proprium*.

### **10.2 The Profile of the Volunteer**

These individuals often exhibit a specific psychological profile:

* **Pre-birth Memories:** Recalling the "Covenant" made with the Jesus of Love before incarnation (Anamnesis).  
* **Alienation:** A sense of not belonging to the "social fragmentation" of the world.  
* **Mission Drive:** A compulsion to serve, heal, or teach.

The "Actual Jesus" is the Commander of this "silent army" of lovers. He empowers them not with authority, but with the capacity to love in a loveless world.

## **11\. The Divine Human in the Modern Rational Mind**

How does the modern, scientific mind access this "Actual Jesus"? The research highlights the role of **Emanuel Swedenborg** as the "articulation of the unmediated connect".26

Swedenborg represents the "Heart of Good" elevated to the rational level. He was a premier scientist—an anatomist, engineer, and philosopher—who used his analytical mind to map the spiritual world. He provides the "rational key" (Doctrine of Correspondences) that allows the modern mind to bypass the "Proprium’s glorification of science".26

Through Swedenborg’s framework, the "Actual Jesus" is not asking for blind faith. He is offering a "Rational Theology." He invites the scientist to see the "Divine Bricolage" in the strata of history, the historian to see the "Bedrock Facts" as spiritual footprints, and the phenomenologist to see the "Being of Light" in the data of consciousness.

## **12\. Conclusion: The Actual Jesus**

The profile that emerges from this exhaustive synthesis is coherent, compelling, and radically distinct from both the "Historical Jesus" of the critics and the "Gnostic Christ" of the esoterics.

The **Actual Jesus of Love** is:

1. **The Culmination of Influx:** The final, perfect vessel forged by the Divine Bricolage through the debris of human history.  
2. **The Victor:** The One who conquered the *proprium* (self-love) through the "bedrock facts" of His life and death (Glorification).  
3. **The Divine Natural:** The One who eats the "broiled fish" of natural truth and sanctifies it, proving that matter and spirit are united in Him.  
4. **The Gardener:** The intimate cultivator of the individual soul, who knows us by name.  
5. **The Being of Light:** The objective, hyper-real personality encountered in NDEs, characterized by absolute, non-judgmental love.  
6. **The Lord of Work:** The active director of human evolution who commissions Volunteer Souls to serve the whole.

He is the "Divine Inflow into humanity." He is the proof that the universe is not a cold, fragmented accident, but a purposeful project of Love, anchored in history, verified by experience, and accessible to every heart that lives a life of charity. He is the Actual Jesus.
