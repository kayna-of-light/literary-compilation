# The Divine Bricolage - Editorial Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository contains an extensive body of interconnected research synthesizing consciousness studies, Swedenborgian theology, biblical scholarship, and mythological analysis into a **unified post-materialist framework**. The goal is to compile these sources into a coherent, stable framework document.

### Core Thesis

The framework employs a **two-tiered epistemology**:

| Tier | Name | Method | Role |
|------|------|--------|------|
| **Natural Plane** | "Body" of Effects | Scientific/Historical-Critical | Accurate map of observable phenomena |
| **Spiritual Plane** | "Soul" of Causes | Swedenborgian Correspondences | Reveals meaning and causation |

The central argument: secular scientific findings are accurate but incomplete descriptions of the "external" reality; the Swedenborgian framework supplies the "internal" interpretation.

## Editorial Guidelines

### Working with Sources

1. **Identify Thematic Domain** — Classify each source by primary domain(s)
2. **Extract Key Arguments** — Document the central thesis of each source
3. **Note Interconnections** — Track how sources reference or build on each other
4. **Identify Evolution** — Mark where ideas have developed or been revised
5. **Resolve Contradictions** — Apply two-tiered hermeneutic to apparent conflicts

### Synthesis Principles

- **Scientific findings are "body"** — Accept HCM and empirical findings at face value
- **Theological framework is "soul"** — Apply Swedenborgian interpretation for meaning
- **Both tiers are valid** — Neither negates the other; they operate on different planes
- **Consciousness is fundamental** — Post-materialist premise throughout
- **History is providential** — Events are vessels for spiritual correspondence

### Quality Standards

When editing or extending the framework:
- [ ] Maintain scholarly register (avoid devotional language)
- [ ] Cite sources appropriately (author, work)
- [ ] Distinguish empirical claims from interpretive claims
- [ ] Preserve the two-tiered structure
- [ ] Cross-reference related sources

## Research Methodology

### The Two-Tiered Hermeneutic

When analyzing any phenomenon or text:

1. **First Tier (Natural)**: What does rigorous secular inquiry reveal?
   - Historical-critical findings
   - Empirical data
   - Scientific consensus
   - Textual evidence

2. **Second Tier (Spiritual)**: What does the Swedenborgian framework reveal?
   - Correspondence relationships
   - Influx dynamics
   - Providential purpose
   - Spiritual causation

### Integration Principle

The findings of the first tier are not negated but *completed* by the second tier. The historical-critical method has "unintentionally performed the exact preparatory work necessary" for spiritual interpretation—scholars have "meticulously prepared the 'body' of the Word" for its "spiritual resurrection."
