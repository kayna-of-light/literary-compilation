## **Executive Summary**

The recovery of the Ethiopic Book of Enoch (*1 Enoch*) in 1773 and the subsequent discovery of Aramaic Enochic fragments at Qumran in 1947 precipitated a theological and historiographical crisis. These texts, clearly influential on the New Testament writers, present a cosmology that is neither strictly Mosaic nor Hellenistic, but deeply rooted in the scientific and mythological soil of the Ancient Near East. This report investigates the hypothesis that *1 Enoch* represents a spiritually guided restoration of a primordial "Ancient Word"—a corpus of wisdom preceding the Hebraic canon—rather than a mere literal rediscovery or syncretic invention.

Utilizing the theological framework of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), we validate the proposition that "Enoch" signifies a collective scribal community tasked with collecting the perceptive wisdom of the "Most Ancient Church," while "Noah" represents the doctrinal vessel constructed to preserve this wisdom through a catastrophic spiritual inundation. We examine the historical transmission of this wisdom through the Zoroastrian Magi and the Aramaic-speaking scribes of the Achaemenid Empire, arguing that the so-called "scientific" texts of the East (such as the *Dāmdād Nask*) constitute the perverted remnants of this Ancient Word.

Furthermore, we evaluate the claim that the scribes of *1 Enoch* engaged in a process of "mythic bricolage" guided by spiritual influx. By cross-referencing modern Near-Death Experience (NDE) research—which authenticates the "Divine Human" archetype—with the scribal "correction" of Mesopotamian astronomy, we demonstrate that the Enochic literature functions as a "re-consecrated" vessel. It strips ancient science of its polytheistic determinism to reveal the "Science of Correspondences," the immutable law binding natural effects to spiritual causes.

## **I. The Epistemological Fracture: Defining the Ancient Word**

To understand the function of *1 Enoch* as a vehicle of restoration, one must first define the substrate it intends to restore. The modern historiographical consensus views the progression of religion as linear: from animism to polytheism to monotheism. However, the Swedenborgian hermeneutic, supported by the internal testimony of Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) texts, posits a devolutionary model. It argues that a primordial, integrated worldview—where the natural world was legible as a spiritual text—was fractured, leading to the separation of "science" from "theology." This chapter establishes the definitions of the "Enoch" and "Noah" entities, not as biological ancestors, but as typological eras of human consciousness.

### **1.1 The Most Ancient Church and the Age of Perception**

Swedenborg’s exegesis in *Arcana Coelestia* posits that the earliest phase of human spirituality, termed the "Most Ancient Church" (symbolized by Adam), was characterized by a cognitive state of "Perception" (*perceptio*). This state was defined by the seamless unity of the Will and the Understanding.1

#### **1.1.1 The Mechanism of Internal Respiration**

The cognitive architecture of this "Golden Age" humanity was fundamentally distinct from modern consciousness. They possessed "internal respiration," a state where their breathing was inextricably linked to the rhythm of their thought and the influx of the Spirit.2 This allowed for a direct, unmediated communication with the spiritual world. They did not require an external, written law because the laws of the universe were inscribed upon their "internal man."

When a member of this community observed a natural object—a mountain, a lamb, or the sun—they did not merely categorize it empirically. They instantly perceived its spiritual correspondence. A mountain was not just geology; it was the "elevation of the heart to the Lord" (Celestial Love). The sun was not just a ball of plasma; it was the Divine Love itself in an external form.3 This "representative language" meant that the entire cosmos served as a living Bible. The epistemological structure was "top-down": the spiritual cause was perceived first, and the natural object was understood merely as its effect.

#### **1.1.2 The Fall and the Necessity of the "Enoch" Function**

The "Fall" is interpreted not as a single moral transgression but as a catastrophic cognitive shift. As the "Most Ancient" people began to appropriate their perception as their own power (the rise of the *proprium* or selfhood), the unity of Will and Understanding was severed. The internal way was closed to prevent the profanation of truth. This crisis necessitated a new medium of revelation. If humanity could no longer *perceive* truth via the Will, they had to *learn* truth via the Understanding.4

This necessity birthed the "Enoch" function.

### **1.2 Enoch as Community: The First Librarians of the Spirit**

Swedenborg explicitly rejects the literal identification of Enoch as a single historical individual in the early chapters of Genesis. Instead, "Enoch" signifies a "community" or a specific "branch of the church" tasked with a monumental preservation effort.4 This redefinition validates the hypothesis that the *1 Enoch* texts are the product of a "scribal school" rather than a lone prophet.

* **The Mission:** The Enoch community recognized that the perceptive faculty was dying out. To prevent the wisdom of the Golden Age from vanishing entirely, they undertook the task of collecting the correspondences that the Most Ancient people perceived and reducing them into a doctrinal system.4  
* **The Transformation:** "Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him" (Gen 5:24). Spiritually, this signifies that this specific mode of perception (walking with God) ceased to exist as a living experience ("he was not") but was preserved for future use ("God took him").4  
* **The Output:** The result of the Enoch community’s labor was the "Ancient Word" (*Verbum Vetustum*). This was a written corpus, composed entirely in the language of correspondences, intended to serve the coming "Ancient Church" (Noah).7

This definition validates the "Enochic" literary tradition's obsession with lists, taxonomies, and astronomical data. *1 Enoch* is not a narrative of a life; it is a *catalog* of the cosmos. This fits perfectly with Swedenborg's description of the Enoch community as "collectors" who reduced perception into doctrine.

### **1.3 Noah as Doctrine: The Ark of Conscience**

If Enoch is the *collector*, Noah is the *container*. The "Flood" represents the inundation of the human mind by falsities and lusts arising from the corrupted Will.5 The "Ark" represents the new cognitive structure—the separation of the Will and the Understanding—constructed to navigate this inundation.

* **Conscience:** The "Noachic" dispensation was established for a new type of human who required "conscience" formed by "external revelation".9 Because the Will was corrupted, the Lord separated the Understanding from it. This allowed humanity to intellectually learn truths (via the Ancient Word preserved by Enoch) and force their Will to obey them.  
* **The Ark’s Dimensions:** The intricate details of the Ark—its three stories, its window, its pitch—are not nautical specifications but correspondential descriptions of this new human mind (Natural, Rational, Spiritual degrees) protected from the flood of the *proprium*.6

**Table 1: The Swedenborgian Typology of Enoch and Noah**

| Entity | Biblical Symbol | Swedenborgian Definition | Function | Cognitive State |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Most Ancient Church** | Adam | The Golden Age of Humanity | Perception (*Perceptio*) | **Unity:** Will & Understanding are One. |
| **Enoch** | "Walked with God" | A Community/Branch of the Church | **Collection:** Gathering the perceptions of the Most Ancient Church into doctrine. | **Transition:** Recognizing the loss of perception. |
| **Noah** | The Ark | The Ancient Church (Silver Age) | **Preservation:** Living by Conscience formed via Doctrine. | **Separation:** Will is corrupt; Understanding is elevated. |

Thus, the hypothesis that *1 Enoch* represents a restoration of the "Ancient Word" relies on the validation of this specific dynamic: a text that functions as a "life-raft" of celestial wisdom, codified into symbols (correspondences) to survive an age of spiritual darkness.

## **II. The Zoroastrian Lineage: The Perversion of the Scientific Nasks**

The "Ancient Word" did not vanish without a trace. Swedenborg locates its remnants in "Great Tartary" (Central Asia/Iran).8 This geographical marker points directly to the Indo-Iranian sphere and the rise of Zoroastrianism. We posit that Zoroastrianism represents the historical institutionalization of the Noachic/Ancient Church, and that its history reveals the "perversion" of the Enochic wisdom.

### **2.1 The Geography of Wisdom: Great Tartary and the Avesta**

Swedenborg’s assertion that the Ancient Word is preserved among the "Tartars" and "Mogols" 8 aligns with the provenance of the Avesta. The *Vendidad* locates the origin of the faith in *Airyana Vaejah*, a region identified with the steppes of Central Asia.11

The Zoroastrian canon, specifically the lost Sasanian Avesta, was divided into three categories: *Gathic* (liturgical), *Dat* (legal), and *Hadha-manthric* (scientific/scholarly).12 This third category, particularly the **Dāmdād Nask**, serves as the primary artifact of the "Enochic" science.

### **2.2 The *Dāmdād Nask*: The Encyclopedia of Correspondence**
> **[REFRAMING #11]**: This section treats the *Dāmdād Nask* as the source/repository of correspondential science. Evidence from cognitive archaeology shows correspondence operating 7,000 years before Zoroaster (Göbekli Tepe) and across zero-contact cultures (Aboriginal songlines, Shasu of Yhw). The *Dāmdād Nask* represents the **codification** of correspondence, not its **invention**—like Newton articulating gravity that already existed.
The *Dāmdād Nask* ("The Nask of the Creation of Creatures") was lost to the West, likely destroyed during Alexander the Great’s conquest of Persepolis (c. 330 BCE).11 However, summaries preserved in the *Bundahishn* and *Denkard* reveal its content, which mirrors the "Science of Correspondences" described by Swedenborg:

* **Taxonomy of Alignment:** The *Dāmdād Nask* classified the natural world not by biological morphology (species/genus) but by spiritual alignment. Creatures were divided into *Gospand* (beneficent/Ahuric) and *Khrafstra* (noxious/Ahrimanic).9 This mirrors the Levitical distinction between "Clean" and "Unclean" animals, which Swedenborg identifies as a derivation from the Ancient Word.7  
* **The Ox-Hide Archives:** Tradition holds that these scientific texts were written in gold ink on 12,000 ox-hides.12 This materiality attests to the high value placed on "natural science" as a sacred discipline.  
* **Microcosm-Macrocosm:** The texts detailed the correspondence between the human body and the cosmos (e.g., bones \= mountains, veins \= rivers).12 This is structurally identical to Swedenborg’s doctrine of the *Maximus Homo* (Grand Man), where the universe is structured in the human form.7

### **2.3 The Perversion: From Wisdom to Magic**

The transition from the "Ancient Church" to idolatry is described by Swedenborg as the perversion of correspondences. As the internal perception faded, men began to worship the *representatives* rather than the *represented*.9

> **[CORRECTION #18]**: This section frames the Magi as originally possessing "the science of reading the heavens" from the Ancient Church. Current synthesis distinguishes the *Bene Qedem* ("Children of the East"—Ishmaelites, Midianites, Edomites, Ketureans) as the primary carriers of living correspondential "nature wisdom," with the Magian priesthood functioning as a later institutional layer that appropriated and codified (and ultimately perverted) that prior lineage. The "Magian Appropriation" is the institutional capture of the Bene Qedem's wisdom.

* **The Magian Shift:** The Magi, originally the "Wise Men" (*Maga*) of the Ancient Church, possessed the science of reading the heavens. However, as self-love (*proprium*) grew, they utilized this knowledge for power. "Magic" (*mageia*) became the manipulation of spiritual laws for earthly gain.13  
* **Astrological Determinism:** The Babylonian/Persian compendiums like *Enuma Anu Enlil* (EAE) codified this perversion. In EAE, the stars were not merely signs; they were causal agents of fate. The movement of a planet *caused* the death of a king. This stripped the Divine of its agency, transferring power to the external mechanism of the cosmos.12

**Table 2: The Trajectory of Correspondence Knowledge**

| Era | State of Science | Relationship to Symbol | Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Most Ancient (Adam)** | Perception | The Symbol *is* the Spiritual Reality. | Wisdom (Eden). |
| **Ancient (Noah/Enoch)** | Doctrine | The Symbol *teaches* the Spiritual Reality. | Sacred Science (*Damdat Nask*). |
| **Magian (Perverted)** | Magic | The Symbol *controls* the Reality. | Idolatry/Sorcery (*Enuma Anu Enlil*). |

### **2.4 The Prophetic Restoration: Zarathushtra and Daniel**

The lineage was not wholly lost. The document 13 and 13 identify two key moments of "correction" within the Magian line itself:

1. **Zarathushtra (Zoroaster):** He reformed the "Magic" by restoring monotheism (*Ahura Mazda*) and clarifying the ethical dualism (*Asha* vs. *Druj*). He stripped the nature-gods (*Daevas*) of their divinity, reclassifying them as demons, thus restoring the distinction between the Holy and the Profane.13  
2. **Daniel:** As a Jewish exile, Daniel was appointed **Rab-signin** ("Chief of the Prefects," Dan. 2:48) and **Rab-chartumayya** ("Chief of the Magicians," Dan. 4:9). While often conflated with the specific title **Rab-mag** (held by Nergal-sharezer in Jer. 39:3), Daniel's functional authority over the Babylonian wise men was absolute. Crucially, this status was not granted based on technical ritual proficiency, but on his superior **pneumatic capacity** (*ruach yattira* or "excellent spirit") found within him (Dan. 5:12). This pneumatic endowment allowed him to resolve "knots" and interpret Divine signs where the standard Magian techniques failed, effectively reintroducing the "true" Science of Correspondences—interpretation via Divine communion rather than technical divination.

## **III. The Aramaic Nexus: The Mechanism of Synthesis**

The transmission of this "Ancient Word" (perverted by the Magi, restored by Daniel) to the scribes of *1 Enoch* was facilitated by a specific technological and linguistic infrastructure: the **Imperial Aramaic** administration of the Achaemenid Empire.

### **3.1 Imperial Aramaic as the "Imperial Lattice"**

Aramaic was the "nervous system" of the Persian Empire.12 It functioned as the interface between the Jewish scribal elites of Yehud and the scientific archives of the Magi.

* **The "Demilitarized Zone" of Language:** Because Aramaic was a secular administrative language (distinct from the liturgical Avestan), it acted as a "neutral container".12 Jewish scribes like Ezra could read Aramaic summaries of Zoroastrian science without engaging in the idolatrous liturgy of the *Yasna*.  
* **Heterograms (*Huzwarish*):** The writing system itself enforced a cognitive synthesis. Scribes wrote Aramaic words (e.g., *MLK'*) but read them aloud as Persian (*Shah*).12 This "heterographic" literacy meant that Jewish scribes were mentally translating Persian concepts into Semitic categories with every stroke of the pen.

### **3.2 The Smoking Gun: The Aramaic Enoch Fragments (4Q208–211)**

The hypothesis that *1 Enoch* draws from this Aramaic/Persian stream is empirically verified by the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Aramaic fragments of the *Astronomical Book* contain undeniable fingerprints of Mesopotamian science:

* **The Linear Zigzag Function:** The texts calculate the length of daylight using a specific ratio (2:1 longest to shortest day).3 This ratio is geographically accurate for **Babylon (32°N)** but inaccurate for **Jerusalem (31°N)**. The retention of this "Babylonian math" proves that the scribes were copying data directly from the Aramaic archives of the East.12  
* **The "Gates" Terminology:** The description of the sun rising through distinct "Gates" (*bāb*) is a direct calque of the Akkadian terminology found in the *MUL.APIN* series.12

However, the Jewish scribes did not merely copy; they "corrected."

## **IV. 1 Enoch as the Restored Vessel: Mythic Bricolage and Correction**

The composition of *1 Enoch* represents a deliberate, spiritually guided program of **"Mythic Bricolage"**.12 The scribes dismantled the "perverted" science of the Magi and reconstructed it within a monotheistic framework, effectively restoring the "Ancient Word" to its original function.

### **4.1 The Astronomical Correction: From Fate to Service**

The *Astronomical Book* (1 En 72–82) is often dismissed as "pseudoscientific" because of its 364-day calendar. However, under Swedenborgian hermeneutics, this is a "Theology of State".3

* **Solar (364) vs. Lunar (354):** The text champions a solar calendar where the year is perfectly divisible by 7 (364 \= 52 x 7). In correspondences, the **Sun** signifies **Divine Love** (Celestial) and the **Number 7** signifies the **Holy State/Sabbath**.3  
* **The "Lagging" Moon:** The text critiques the lunar calendar for "falling behind" the sun by 10 days. Spiritually, the **Moon** corresponds to **Faith/Truth** (Spiritual). The polemic asserts that a church ruled only by Faith (Lunar/Jewish) "lags behind" the perfect order of a church ruled by Love (Solar/Enochian).3  
* **The "Correction" of Agency:** Unlike the *Enuma Anu Enlil*, where stars control fate, *1 Enoch* presents the stars as "obedient servants." They follow the "command of the Lord." The scribes stripped the astrological determinism (Magian perversion) and restored the "Science of Correspondences" (the order of nature reflects the Will of God).12

### **4.2 The "Son of Man" Controversy: Resolving the Identity**

A central theological tension in *1 Enoch* is the identification of Enoch himself as the "Son of Man" in *Parables of Enoch* (1 En 71:14). Traditional scholarship views this as a heretical apotheosis. However, the Swedenborgian "Representative" framework resolves this.3

* **Enoch as Doctrine:** As established, "Enoch" represents the "Collected Doctrine" of the Ancient Word.  
* **Son of Man as Divine Truth:** The title "Son of Man" corresponds to the "Divine Truth" or "The Word".3  
* **The Resolution:** When the angel declares to Enoch, "You are that Son of Man," it is not elevating a human to godhood. It is a theological tautology: **"This Doctrine (Enoch) is the Divine Truth (Son of Man)."** The text describes the *glorification* of the Ancient Word—the realization that the doctrinal container (Enoch) is filled with the Divine Truth itself.3

### **4.3 The Animal Apocalypse: Preserving the Dispensational History**

The *Animal Apocalypse* (1 En 85–90) retells history using animal symbols (Bulls and Sheep). This is not arbitrary allegory but a rigorous application of correspondences.3

* **White Bull (Adam/Enoch):** Represents the **Celestial State** (Innocence/Will) of the Most Ancient Church.  
* **Sheep (Jacob/Israel):** Represents the **Spiritual State** (Charity/Faith) of the Ancient/Jewish Church.  
* **New White Bull (Messiah):** The eschaton brings a return to the "White Bull," signifying the restoration of the Celestial State (the New Jerusalem).

The scribes successfully preserved the internal history of the church—the shift from Will (Bull) to Conscience (Sheep) and back to Will (Bull)—confirming their access to the "Ancient Word" lineage.3

## **V. The Mechanism of Influx: Spiritual Instructions and the Scribe**

The user’s query asks to evaluate the claim that these scribes received "spiritual instructions" to perform this correction. The research 18 supports this by linking the scribal process to **Spiritual Influx** and modern **NDE** data.

### **5.1 Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) of Myths**

The "CDE Model" 18 posits that myths evolve along trajectories determined by the "ruling love" of the collective consciousness.

* **Trajectory B (Proprium):** Myths evolve towards chaos and power (e.g., *Enuma Elish*, where creation is violence).  
* **Trajectory A (Influx):** Myths are "purified" by a consciousness open to Divine Influx.

The Jewish scribes of *1 Enoch* were operating on **Trajectory A**. They accessed the "neutral proto-myth" (Persian science) and, guided by influx, "purified" it. They did not invent the data; they "re-consecrated" it. This "unconscious guidance" (or super-conscious inspiration) acted as a selective pressure, forcing the exclusion of polytheistic elements.18

### **5.2 NDEs and the "Divine Human" Validation**

Modern Near-Death Experience (NDE) research provides an empirical "fingerprint" of this influx.18

* **The Being of Light:** NDErs encounter a being of absolute love and acceptance, often identified as the "Divine Human."  
* **Validation of Enochic Theology:** This mirrors the "Son of Man" in *1 Enoch*—a pre-existent, righteous judge who is the prototype of humanity.  
* **Vertical Causality:** The fact that modern NDErs and ancient Enochic scribes describe the same spiritual reality (the Divine Human/Son of Man) suggests they are accessing the same "Vertical Cause." The scribes were not just literary editors; they were "mystics of the library," using the text to map the same spiritual terrain that NDErs traverse.7

### **5.3 The Scribe as *Rab-chartumayya***

Just as Daniel was appointed "Chief of the Magicians" (*Rab-chartumayya*) to restore wisdom from within the Babylonian court, the scribes of *1 Enoch* acted as agents of restoration. They utilized the prestige of the "Enoch" figure not to "steal" authority, but to **locate the true source of wisdom**. They asserted that the true source of science was not the *apkallu* (sages) of Babylon, but the patriarch Enoch who "walked with God".12

This was not a "hostile takeover" of the intellectual landscape born of the *proprium* (self-hood), but a **restorative witness** guided by the conviction that all Truth belongs to the Divine. It was not an attempt to divide or establish power, but simply to present the truth as perceived through Divine Influx—a truth that does not need to be established because it eternally *is*.

## **VI. Conclusion: The Deep but Difficult Synthesis**

The investigation confirms the hypothesis: **1 Enoch represents a spiritually guided restoration of the Ancient Word.**

1. **Enoch is the Method, Noah is the Vessel:** The Swedenborgian definitions hold. *1 Enoch* functions as the "doctrinal collection" (Enoch) designed to preserve the "Celestial" perception (Solar Calendar/White Bull) within a "Spiritual" era (Lunar/Sheep).  
2. **Zoroastrianism is the Broken Line:** The *Dāmdād Nask* and the Magian tradition represent the "perverted" preservation of this same Word. They kept the "science" (correspondences) but lost the "soul" (monotheism), devolving into magic and astrological determinism.  
3. **The Correction was Real:** The Aramaic fragments prove that Jewish scribes accessed this perverted science and rigorously "corrected" it. They stripped the stars of their divinity and restored them as servants of the One God.  
4. **Influx was the Guide:** The consistency of the "correction"—always moving towards the "Divine Human" and the "Science of Correspondences"—indicates a consistent source of Spiritual Influx. The scribes were not merely copying; they were listening.

This synthesis was **"Deep"** because it permanently embedded the "Science of Correspondences" (Angelology, Eschatology, Cosmology) into the DNA of Judaism and Christianity. It was **"Difficult"** because it required a centuries-long struggle to deconstruct the seductive dualism of the Empire and reconstruct it within the fragile framework of the Covenant.12

*1 Enoch*, therefore, is not Apocrypha in the pejorative sense. It is a "Broken Tablet"—a surviving fragment of the Ox-Hide Archives, written in the gold ink of the Celestial Church, testifying to a time when the heavens were not a mechanism of fate, but the very language of God.
