# **The Covenant of the Call: A Theological and Phenomenological Analysis of "Do what thou hast promised" in the Spiritual Crisis of Emanuel Swedenborg**

## **Introduction: The Delft Theophany as Ontological Fulcrum**

The spiritual journey of Emanuel Swedenborg, the 18th-century Swedish scientist and polymath, pivoted on a single, transformative event. During the Easter week of 1744, while residing in Delft, Netherlands, Swedenborg experienced a profound Christophany that did not merely alter his perspective but re-forged his very identity and purpose. This encounter, meticulously recorded in his private *Journal of Dreams*, represents an ontological fulcrum, marking his definitive transition from a man of science seeking the soul to a revelator commissioned by the Divine. At the heart of this theophany lies a simple yet potent command: "Well, then do" (*Nå så giör*), which Swedenborg immediately interpreted as "Do what thou hast promised". This imperative was not an arbitrary assignment but the articulation of a divine covenant, one that retroactively gave ultimate meaning to his decades of scientific preparation and charted the course for the entirety of his future theological mission.  
This divine commission was the culmination of a profound personal and spiritual crisis that had enveloped Swedenborg for months. His entire scientific career, particularly his exhaustive anatomical and physiological works such as *Regnum Animale* (The Soul's Domain), can be understood as a systematic, empirical attempt to locate the soul and its nexus with the physical body. It was a rational, bottom-up quest to bridge the Cartesian divide between mind and matter, a search for the infinite within the finite. This quest, however, reached its intellectual and spiritual terminus, precipitating a crisis of purpose, faith, and personal worthiness. The vision in Delft represents a complete inversion of this dynamic. It was a top-down intervention, a direct and unmediated response from the object of his search. The Divine, whom Swedenborg had sought through the intricate pathways of the human body, turned and addressed the seeker directly. In this moment, Swedenborg's role was irrevocably transformed from that of an investigator to that of a commissioned servant. The command "Do what thou hast promised," therefore, was not a new directive but the divine reframing and sanctification of the very quest he had been pursuing his entire adult life.

## **Part I: The Anatomy of a Spiritual Crisis (1743-1744)**

The Christophany of April 1744 cannot be understood in isolation. It was the climactic resolution of a prolonged period of intense internal trial, a state his later theology would term "vastation"—a painful purification necessary for spiritual rebirth. This period was characterized by a systematic dismantling of his self-reliance, intellectual pride, and the very rational faculties that had defined his success as a scientist. This state of profound internal struggle was the necessary precondition for his divine commission.

### **The Struggle with Self-Love and Pride**

At the core of Swedenborg's crisis was a conscious and agonizing battle against what he termed the love of self. As a celebrated figure in European science, he was acutely aware of the temptation to work for personal glory. His journal entries reveal a man stripping himself of this fundamental motivation. Early in the crisis, he noted with wonder that "there remained nothing of \[the desire\] to work for my own glory, so as to have sensation thereof". Yet, the temptation was persistent. Later, he recorded the intrusive thought that "my work would have greater effect than the works of others," a notion he immediately identified as pride that he must pray for God to control. This conflict between a divinely-oriented purpose and the deep-rooted human drive for recognition was the central battleground of his soul during this period.

### **The Phenomenon of "Double Thoughts"**

A distinct feature of Swedenborg's crisis was his frequent and distressing experience of what he called "double thoughts." He describes being in a "state of combat with double thoughts which were fighting one another". This was not a sign of a disordered mind, but rather a hyper-awareness of the fundamental conflict between two layers of his consciousness. In the framework of his later psychology, this represents the struggle between the "internal man," which is aligned with the spirit and divine influx, and the "external man," which is governed by the body, sensory input, and self-love. During his crisis, these two aspects of his being were laid bare, their opposition no longer a subtle undercurrent but a conscious and exhausting war within his mind.

### **Spiritual Unworthiness and Temptation**

This internal conflict plunged Swedenborg into a state of profound spiritual unworthiness and existential despair. His journal is replete with confessions of his sinfulness, describing himself as "unworthy above others and the greatest of sinners". This was not mere pious rhetoric but a deep perception that his sins, rooted in intellectual pride, came from a "deeper source than in the case of many other persons". This sense of unworthiness was accompanied by severe temptations against faith itself. On the very eve of his commission, he records wrestling with intellectual doubt concerning the miracles of Moses, a state where he "believed and yet did not believe". These periods of "interior anxiety" and temptation brought him to the edge of what he perceived as damnation, creating a state of profound humility that would become the fertile ground for grace.  
This crisis represented a complete inversion of his previous intellectual posture. As a scientist of the Enlightenment, Swedenborg had operated from a position of rational mastery, believing that the universe and its secrets could be unlocked through empirical observation and logical deduction. His spiritual crisis was precipitated by the failure of this method to answer the ultimate questions of existence. This failure forced him to a critical conclusion: true faith must be received "without reasoning" and that one must abolish the "adoration of one's own understanding". The crisis was therefore not simply emotional turmoil; it was the methodological deconstruction of the scientist to prepare him for the role of the revelator, a role predicated not on discovering truth, but on receiving it.

## **Part II: The Encounter: "I Beheld Him Face to Face"**

The Christophany of the night between April 6th and 7th, 1744, was a multi-sensory, psycho-physical event that overwhelmed Swedenborg's being and established a new covenant. A phenomenological reconstruction of his own account reveals a carefully orchestrated sequence, moving from intellectual struggle to somatic takeover, and culminating in a direct, personal commission.  
The experience began not in a state of spiritual exaltation, but in one of profound intellectual doubt. As Swedenborg read about the miracles of Moses, he found his own understanding mixing into the narrative, causing his faith to be "less firm". This state of intellectual wrestling set the stage for a revelation that would bypass the rational mind entirely. The first manifestation was auditory and somatic. Lying in bed, he "heard a noise beneath my head" and then felt a "powerful tremor, from the head and over the whole body". This escalated into a "booming sound as if many winds had clashed against one another," an indescribable force that "shook me and prostrated me on my face".  
This physical prostration signified a complete surrender of his own will. In this state, he found that the words of his prayer were not his own, but were "put into my mouth". He spoke as a vessel: "Oh, Thou Almighty Jesus Christ, who of Thy great mercy deignest to come to so great a sinner, make me worthy of this grace\!". As he prayed with folded hands, "there came forth a hand which strongly pressed my hands," a tangible confirmation of the divine presence.  
At this juncture, a subtle but powerful dynamic of mutual obligation was established. Swedenborg's prayer shifted from simple supplication to a covenantal appeal, reminding the Divine of His own pledge: "Thou hast promised to receive in grace all sinners; Thou canst not otherwise than keep Thy words\!". This act of holding God to His own promise created a relationship based on reciprocal fidelity. It was only after this appeal that the vision culminated. Swedenborg found himself sitting at Christ's bosom, beholding Him "face to face." He described "a countenance of a holy mien, and all was such that it cannot be expressed, and also smiling". In this intimate state, Christ spoke to him, first asking if he had a "bill of health," a query Swedenborg understood as a test of his spiritual preparedness. Then came the final, simple, yet all-encompassing command: "Well, then do" (*Nå så giör*). This response from Christ, following directly upon Swedenborg's appeal to a divine promise, was not a unilateral order but the reciprocal fulfillment of a newly forged covenant. It established Swedenborg's mission not as an act of mere servitude, but as a partnership—a concept that would become central to his later theology, which posits that God requires human cooperation to fulfill His divine purposes.

## **Part III: Deconstructing the Divine Imperative: "Do What Thou Hast Promised"**

The divine command, "Well, then do," was immediately imbued with a dual meaning in Swedenborg's mind. As he recorded, "This I found in my mind to signify, 'Love me truly,' or 'Do what thou hast promised'". This twofold interpretation is not a sign of ambiguity but of profound theological density. It encapsulates the core of Swedenborg's entire subsequent project: the inseparable union of the internal life of the will (love and faith) and the external life of action (works and use).  
The internal dimension, "Love me truly," is a direct call for the reorientation of his fundamental being. In his later theological system, the "ruling love" (*amor regnans*) is the very essence of a person, determining their eternal destiny. The primary task of human life, or "regeneration," is to subordinate the love of self and the world to the love of God and the neighbor. The command to "Love me truly" was thus a commission to undertake this process of regeneration in himself, to make the love of God the new center of his existence.  
The external dimension, "Do what thou hast promised," is the necessary manifestation of that internal love. This interpretation is directly linked to his doctrine of "use" (*usus*), which holds that a life of faith is a life of active, useful service. It forms the foundation for his later, strenuous rejection of the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone (*sola fide*). For Swedenborg, faith and charity (or love in action) are not two separate things but are the internal and external aspects of a single reality, like soul and body. The commission was not merely to believe, but to *do*—to perform the specific, useful work for which his entire life had been a preparation.  
The "promise" itself was not a single, explicit vow made at a specific time. Rather, it was the implicit, teleological purpose of his entire existence, which he now understood had been guided from the beginning by Divine Providence. In a later reflection, he would write that "the tenor of Divine Providence has ruled the acts of my life from my very youth... that I might finally come to the present end". He came to see that "the spirit had been with me from my youth unto this end". The promise was the fulfillment of his unique potential, the actualization of the purpose for which he was created.  
In this unified imperative, Swedenborg, a man of the Enlightenment, received a command that implicitly refutes the Cartesian mind-body dualism that had shaped his era. The injunctions to "Love me truly" (an act of the will, or mind) and "Do what thou hast promised" (an act of the body and life) are presented as two facets of a single, indivisible reality. His scientific work had been a long, arduous attempt to bridge this philosophical gap by finding the soul's physical seat. The divine command itself provided a revealed solution, establishing the holistic, integrated nature of the human being—a being whose internal love is only real when it is manifested in external action. This would become a cornerstone of his theological anthropology.

## **Part IV: The Archetype of the Prophet's Call: A Comparative Analysis**

Swedenborg's commission in Delft, while unique in its context and content, falls within a recognizable archetypal pattern of prophetic call narratives found throughout the Judeo-Christian tradition. Comparing his experience to those of key biblical figures like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and St. Paul reveals both a shared structure of divine calling and the specific character of Swedenborg's unique role as a "rational revelator" for a scientific age.  
The parallels are striking. Like Isaiah, Swedenborg has a direct vision of divine majesty that immediately precipitates a profound sense of his own sinfulness and unworthiness. Isaiah cries out, "Woe is me\! For I am a man of unclean lips," while Swedenborg feels himself to be the "greatest of sinners." Both are then purified—Isaiah by a seraph's burning coal, Swedenborg by the overwhelming power of the Holy Spirit—and subsequently commissioned to speak for God. Like Ezekiel, Swedenborg is commanded to internalize a new reality; Ezekiel must literally eat a scroll containing God's message, embodying the words he is to speak, which parallels Swedenborg's need to fully assimilate the spiritual truths he is now tasked to reveal. The most dramatic parallel is with St. Paul on the road to Damascus. Both men are engaged in their own pursuits when they are arrested by a divine theophany, struck to the ground, and engaged in a direct dialogue with Christ that radically and permanently alters the course of their lives.  
Despite these structural similarities, a crucial distinction defines the uniqueness of Swedenborg's mission. The biblical prophets were often called to deliver messages of judgment or to undertake a mission that represented a radical break with their past. Paul's call was a complete reversal of his identity, from persecutor to apostle. Swedenborg, in contrast, was commissioned to *continue and complete* the work for which he had been prepared. The command "Do what thou hast promised" affirms, rather than repudiates, the trajectory of his life. His decades of scientific study were not rendered obsolete; they were consecrated as the necessary foundation for his new task. He later affirmed this, stating that he had been introduced by the Lord into the natural sciences from 1710 to 1744 specifically so that he could be prepared to understand and teach spiritual truths rationally. His commission, therefore, was not to be a prophet of judgment in the classical sense, but a teacher and systematizer of spiritual truth for the Age of Reason. His call was uniquely tailored to the intellectual climate of the Enlightenment.

## **Part V: The Aftermath: A Life Re-Commissioned**

The Christophany of April 1744 did not mark an end to Swedenborg's spiritual struggles, but it did provide him with a definitive purpose and a new framework for understanding them. The entries in his *Journal of Dreams* for the remainder of April trace the immediate and profound impact of the commission on his self-perception, his work, and his ongoing internal battles.  
The most immediate effect was an overwhelming sense of humility coupled with inmost joy. He records, "Every now and then I burst into tears, not of sorrow but of inmost joy that our Lord has been willing to show such great grace to so unworthy a sinner". Through this experience, he learned that "the one and only thing is to cast oneself in humility upon the grace of our Lord". This state of grateful submission became the new foundation of his spiritual life.  
His vast body of scientific and philosophical work was immediately re-contextualized. A dream later that year, on the night of October 6-7, confirmed this new direction when he was told that his next project would be a "divine Book on the worship and love of God" (*De Cultu et Amore Dei*). This was a direct fulfillment of the commission. He came to understand that to love his own works for their own sake would be a "meretricious love," but when they were viewed as a "medium for the only love, which is the love of God and Christ Jesus," they were sanctified and made holy.  
This led to the formation of a new identity: that of a passive instrument for a higher power. A dream on August 27-28 signified to him "how I receive help in my work from a higher hand, so that I am simply used as an instrument". This fundamental shift from the active, rational seeker to the receptive, obedient vessel is a direct and lasting consequence of his commission. This new role was further solidified by a clear directive, received in a dream on April 25-26, "not to contaminate myself by \[reading\] other books, treating of theology and such subjects; because this I have in the Word of God and from the Holy Spirit". He confirmed this in later letters, stating he was "forbidden to read writers on dogmatic and systematic theology" to prevent the insinuation of baseless opinions. This mandate established his future work as being of a purely revelatory, not scholarly, origin.  
Crucially, the vision did not end his temptations; it reframed them and armed him for the ongoing battle. He continued to be assailed by "double thoughts" and pride. On April 19-20, he records being in a "most severe temptation," where ungodly thoughts arose even as he thought of Jesus Christ. The difference now was his internal state. He writes that he was "never of better courage" because the Lord had given him "the firm faith and confidence that He will help me". The commission was not, therefore, a graduation from spiritual warfare but an ordination *for* it. It provided him with the certainty of his divine purpose and the authority needed to engage in the lifelong process of regeneration, a process he would later codify in detail for all of humanity.

## **Conclusion: From Promise to Doctrine**

The personal, existential command that Emanuel Swedenborg received in a room in Delft in 1744—"Do what thou hast promised"—became the universal, doctrinal principle of his mature theology. This intensely private covenant was the seed from which his entire system of spiritual life would grow, transforming a singular experience into a comprehensive framework for human regeneration.  
The dual interpretation that immediately arose in his mind—"Love me truly" and "Do what thou hast promised"—became the bedrock of his core doctrine on the absolute unity of Faith and Charity. His adamant rejection of the doctrine of salvation by faith *alone* was not merely a theological disagreement; it was rooted in the very nature of his own divine commission, which was predicated not on a passive belief but on an active *doing*. For Swedenborg, to love God ("Love me truly") without manifesting that love in a life of useful service to the neighbor ("Do what thou hast promised") was a spiritual impossibility.  
The concept of the "promise" as the divinely guided purpose of his entire life, overseen from his youth, expanded into his major theological work, *Divine Providence*. In that text, the personal realization of a guided life becomes a universal law: God's foresight and care govern every moment of every person's existence, constantly leading them, within the bounds of their own freedom, toward a heavenly use and eternal happiness.  
Finally, the new identity he assumed in the aftermath of the vision—that of a humble "instrument" —was fully realized in his public role as the author of the new revelation. In the preface to his final magnum opus, *True Christian Religion*, he terms himself simply a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ," the transcriber of doctrines for a New Church. The man who began as a celebrated scientist, seeking glory through his own intellect, ended as an anonymous vessel for a divine message. Ultimately, the command given to Swedenborg is revealed in his writings as the universal call to all humanity: to recognize the divinely-guided purpose inherent in one's life (the "promise"); to orient one's deepest love toward God ("Love me truly"); and to manifest that love through a life of active, useful service ("Do"). The personal covenant became a universal soteriology.
