# **The Unhidden Man: Emanuel Swedenborg's Inner World and the Forging of a Prophetic Vision**

## **Introduction: The Man in the Machine**

On the night of March 24, 1744, Emanuel Swedenborg, then a 56-year-old man of international scientific repute, recorded a disquieting dream in his private journal. "I was standing by a machine which was moved by a wheel," he wrote, "its spokes involved me more and more and carried me up so that I could not escape" \]. This image serves as a potent metaphor for his state at this critical juncture. A master of mechanics, metallurgy, and anatomy, Swedenborg was a quintessential figure of the Enlightenment, a man who had dedicated his life to understanding the rational machinery of the cosmos. Yet, in this dream, the very mechanism of his intellectual life had become a trap, an inexorable force from which he could not break free. His own interpretation—that the dream concerned his ongoing anatomical research on "the lungs in the womb"—reveals a mind already straining to bridge the mechanical and the organic, the scientific and the spiritual \].  
This report posits that this private document, known as the *Journal of Dreams*, is the definitive key to understanding the "man underneath" the polished, systematic edifice of his later theological works. For seven months, from March to October 1744, Swedenborg maintained a raw, uncensored record of a profound psychological and spiritual crisis. Within its pages, his personal struggles with pride, sexuality, and ambition were systematically confronted, reinterpreted, and ultimately sublimated into the universal doctrines that would define his life's second act as a revelator. This analysis will demonstrate how his personal biases, rooted in his lived experiences and the cultural milieu of 18th-century Sweden, are not merely incidental to his theology but are foundational to the very structure of his cosmology. By meticulously tracing the path from private torment to public prophecy, this report will make clear the human forces that shaped his divine vision, providing a critical framework for evaluating his claims.

## **Section I: The World of Emanuel Swedenborg: Scientist, Nobleman, Seeker**

To comprehend the crisis of 1744, one must first grasp the profound dualities that defined Emanuel Swedenborg's life and environment. He was a man forged in the intellectual fires of the European Enlightenment, yet his heart and heritage were steeped in the fervent piety of Lutheran Sweden. This fundamental tension between reason and revelation, between the empirical world and the spiritual, was the central conflict he would spend his life attempting to resolve.

### **The Enlightenment Mind**

Born in 1688, Swedenborg came of age during the zenith of the Scientific Revolution. His education and early career placed him at the forefront of this new world of empirical inquiry. After graduating from the University of Uppsala, he embarked on a grand tour of Europe, immersing himself in the scientific centers of London, Amsterdam, and Paris. He studied astronomy with John Flamsteed, moved in the same intellectual circles as Isaac Newton, and mastered a host of practical sciences from watchmaking to metallurgy.  
Upon returning to Sweden, he was appointed Assessor of the Royal Board of Mines, a position he held for over thirty years. In this capacity, he was a practical engineer and a prolific scientific author. He published Sweden's first scientific journal, wrote the country's first book on algebra, and produced a massive three-volume work, *Opera Philosophica et Mineralia* (1734), which became a standard reference on mining. The first volume of this work, the *Principia*, contained his cosmology, in which he first proposed the nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system, anticipating Kant and Laplace. His was a mind committed to discovering the mathematical and mechanical order of the physical universe, a true product of the Age of Reason.

### **The Pious Heart**

This rational, scientific worldview was in constant dialogue with the deep religiosity of his upbringing. His father, Jesper Swedberg, was a court chaplain, a professor of theology, and ultimately a bishop in the Lutheran state church. The Swedberg household was devout, and Bishop Swedberg himself was influenced by Pietism, a powerful religious movement within Lutheranism that reacted against rigid dogmatism. Pietism emphasized a heartfelt, personal conversion, an experiential faith, and the importance of practical Christian living—the "religion of the heart" over scholastic theology. This environment instilled in the young Emanuel a belief in the immediate presence of the spiritual world, a conviction that angels and spirits were active participants in daily life. This created an internal schism: his scientific training demanded empirical proof, while his religious heritage affirmed an unseen reality accessible only through faith.

### **The Search for the Soul**

Swedenborg's anatomical studies of the 1730s and early 1740s represent the critical bridge between his two worlds. His explicit goal was to use the tools of science to solve the ultimate spiritual question. In works like *Oeconomia Regni Animalis* (Dynamics of the Soul's Domain, 1740-41) and *Regnum Animale* (The Soul's Domain, 1744-45), he embarked on a systematic, empirical quest to locate the "seat of the soul" and to understand the precise mechanism of soul-body interaction. These were not abstract philosophical treatises; they were grounded in meticulous anatomical observation and physiological theory. He made remarkable, prescient discoveries about the functions of the cerebral cortex, the pituitary gland, and the neuron concept.  
This scientific project, however, was predicated on the belief that the spiritual could ultimately be explained through the material. When his anatomical dissections and brilliant physiological theories inevitably failed to physically isolate the soul, he reached an intellectual and spiritual impasse. The rational "machine" he had perfected could not grasp the spirit. This failure created a profound psychological vacuum, setting the stage for his crisis. His "spiritual awakening" was not a sudden break from his scientific self, but a direct, albeit violent, continuation of his lifelong empirical investigation into the nature of reality. When the external, objective method failed, his psyche turned inward, seeking data from the subjective realm of dreams and visions, the only remaining frontier for his relentless inquiry.

## **Section II: The Crucible of 1744: An Anatomy of Spiritual Crisis**

The *Journal of Dreams* is an unparalleled document, a real-time log of a mind in the process of radical transformation. In it, Swedenborg lays bare his deepest anxieties, temptations, and spiritual ecstasies. It is here, in this crucible of intense self-examination, that the raw materials of his later theology were forged. By deconstructing the journal's key themes, we can witness the psychological processes that turned a scientist into a seer.

### **The Grammar of Temptation**

Swedenborg's dreams are filled with a recurring lexicon of anxiety. The "abyss" appears frequently, representing his terror of spiritual damnation and the failure of his life's work. In one dream, he is on a ladder over a hole leading to "quite a great depth," symbolizing the danger he is in "of falling into the abyss, unless I receive help" \]. In another, he is reclining on a mountain with an abyss below, trying to rescue himself by his own power, "which was not possible" \]. His spiritual state is often depicted as a physical space. When he invites "the highest beings to visit," he finds himself in an "unprepared and untidy hut," for which he deserves punishment \]. This imagery directly reflects his feelings of unworthiness. The dream of being arrested for having taken a key to anatomy suggests a profound guilt over his intellectual ambition, a fear that he is attempting to seize spiritual knowledge illegitimately, without divine sanction \]. These are not abstract symbols but the direct, visceral language of a man terrified of his own spiritual impurity and inadequacy.

### **The *Proprium* Personified: Projecting the Inner Shadow**

One of the most revealing psychological mechanisms in the journal is Swedenborg's tendency to project his own internal struggles—what he would later codify as the *proprium*, or selfhood—onto real figures from his social and professional life.

* **Erland Broman:** A courtier and favorite of King Fredrik I, Broman was known for his worldliness and his role as an intermediary in the king's amorous intrigues \]. For Swedenborg, he becomes the living embodiment of temptation. In a dream from Easter weekend, a period of intense spiritual combat, Swedenborg finds himself resisting Broman's efforts to get him "on his side, so as to be of that party (voluptuousness, riches, vanity)" \]. The dream culminates in a violent struggle with a dog that is "B\[roman's\] dog." Swedenborg seizes the dog by the jaws and squeezes "so that the venom burst forth" \]. This is a graphic depiction of his attempt to purge his own worldly ambitions and desires, which he has externalized and personified in the figure of Broman.  
* **Anders Swab:** A relative and colleague from the Board of Mines, Swab appears in a dream as a dog that "could speak" and "kissed me" \]. Swedenborg's immediate interpretation is a prayer for mercy "because I cherish much pride which flatters me" \]. Swab, a man he knew intimately in the world of professional hierarchies and rivalries, becomes a symbol for the seductive flattery of the ego.

This psychological process of projecting his own worst impulses onto specific individuals is the seed of his later cosmology. In his fully developed theology, hell is not a place of arbitrary punishment but is composed of societies of spirits bound together by their shared evil loves, such as the love of dominion or the love of worldly riches. The *Journal* reveals the origin of this concept: his mind was already organizing his internal temptations into social "parties" (Broman's party) and personifying them with figures from his own life. His later detailed descriptions of hellish societies in the *Spiritual Diary*, populated by former colleagues and political figures, are a universalization of this deeply personal psychological mechanism. Swedenborg's hell is, in a very real sense, a projection of the Swedish court and the professional rivalries of the Board of Mines, populated by the archetypes of temptation he knew firsthand.

### **Sacred and Profane Love: The Sublimation of Libido**

The journal is unflinchingly honest about Swedenborg's carnal nature, which he confesses had been his "chief passion" throughout his life \]. He records erotic dreams with startling frankness. In one, he is with a woman and reflects that their act of intercourse must result in a child, departing from the scene "*en merveille*" (marvelously) \]. In another, he encounters the archetypal image of the *vagina dentata*, where a woman he desires has "teeth" in her private parts, preventing entry , \].  
Crucially, however, he never leaves these dreams as simple records of carnal experience. He consistently and systematically reinterprets them as symbols of a higher, purer reality. The woman with whom he has intercourse, he concludes, signifies "the love of what is holy... the love of wisdom," and the act itself, being pure, represents "the love of wisdom" \]. A dream of choosing between two women is not about romantic indecision but about his conflict between his old "philosophical studies" and his new "spiritual ones" \]. This reveals a powerful and consistent psychological defense mechanism: sublimation. He takes the raw, powerful energy of his libido, which he recognizes as a source of temptation and impurity, and translates it into the "purer" language of intellectual and spiritual striving. This same method, when formalized and universalized, becomes his Doctrine of Correspondences, the very key to his theological system. In this doctrine, every natural object, act, and desire (the profane) is seen as a direct symbol or "correspondent" of a spiritual truth (the sacred). The doctrine that unlocks the secrets of the Bible is thus rooted in his personal psychological strategy for managing and sanctifying his own sexuality.

### **The Vision of the Crucified: The Point of No Return**

The spiritual crisis documented in the journal reaches its climax during Easter of 1744\. The entries leading up to the event detail a state of profound despair. He feels an "anxiety as if I were damned and in hell," afflicted by "fugitive thoughts" opposed to his better knowledge, and a sense that "confidence and love seemed to be absent" , \].  
The theophany itself, occurring on the night of April 6-7 in Delft, is marked by intense physical and sensory phenomena: "a powerful tremor, from the head and over the whole body, together with a resounding noise" that "shook me and prostrated me on my face" , , \]. In this state, he finds words put into his mouth: "Oh, Thou Almighty Jesus Christ, who of Thy great mercy deignest to come to so great a sinner, make me worthy of this grace\!" \]. He then beholds Christ "face to face," whose countenance was of a "holy mien" and "smiling" \]. The vision concludes with a divine commission. Christ asks him if he has a "bill of health," and when Swedenborg defers, Christ commands, "Well, then do" \]. Swedenborg interprets this as a command to "Love me truly," or "Do what thou hast promised" \].  
His immediate reaction perfectly encapsulates the fusion of the mystic and the scientist that defined him. He is beset by rational doubt: "What may this be? Is it Christ, the Son of God, that I have seen? It is a sin that I am doubting it, but as it is commanded that we are to try the spirits, I reflected on everything" \]. He proceeds to empirically verify the experience, analyzing the preceding events as a divine "purification" and the holiness of the prayer as evidence of its divine origin \]. This moment, where mystical experience is immediately subjected to rational analysis, marks the point of no return. It is the birth of the revelator, a man convinced by both vision and reason that he has been given a divine mandate.  
**Table 1: A Lexicon of Swedenborg's Personal Correspondences (1744)**  
To make Swedenborg's internal world "clear as day," it is essential to understand the personal symbolic language he developed during this period. The following table isolates key recurring symbols from his *Journal of Dreams*, providing his own interpretations and their deeper psychological and theological significance. This lexicon serves as a Rosetta Stone for his psyche, revealing the process by which personal experience was translated into spiritual principle.

| Dream Symbol | Key Journal Entry () | Swedenborg's Interpretation | Psychological/Theological Significance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Dog** | , , , | Erland Broman's party; pride that flatters; uncontrolled thoughts; intellectual presumption. | The externalization of his own *proprium* (selfhood), particularly intellectual vanity and worldly ambition. The dog represents the untamed, often flattering or aggressive, animal nature of the self that must be subdued. |
| **Woman** | , , , , | Mental work; philosophical vs. spiritual studies; the love of wisdom; piety; the sciences. | The consistent sublimation of libido. Female figures become the muses and embodiments of his intellectual and spiritual pursuits, transforming carnal desire into a sanctified quest for truth and wisdom. |
| **Ladder/Stairway** | , , | Danger of falling into the abyss; making use of the cross too boldly; spiritual ascent. | A direct metaphor for his anxiety about his spiritual progress. The journey upward is precarious, with the constant threat of a fall due to his own actions, unworthiness, or spiritual recklessness. |
| **Palace/House** | , , | The plan of his work; the reward for his work on "organic forms"; the structure of his future theological work. | The conflation of his life's work with his spiritual destiny. The "palace" is both the intellectual structure he is building and the heavenly reward he hopes to inhabit, merging earthly ambition with divine promise. |
| **King Charles XII** | , , | Receiving instruction; God's omniscience; dedicating his new mission to a higher authority. | The transformation of a powerful but flawed earthly authority figure from his youth into a symbol of divine authority. Charles XII becomes a stand-in for God, representing direct, though sometimes obscure, communication and divine oversight. |

## **Section III: Forging a New Cosmos: From Personal Struggle to Universal Doctrine**

The intense, private struggles recorded in the 1744 journal did not remain a personal matter. They became the foundational experiences upon which Swedenborg constructed his vast and systematic theological universe. The psychological mechanisms he developed to cope with his crisis were refined, universalized, and presented as divine law. This section traces the direct lines of influence from the raw data of the *Journal* to the polished doctrines of his major theological works.

### **The Doctrine of Correspondences: A Dreamer's Logic**

The interpretive method Swedenborg applied to his dreams—translating dogs into pride and women into wisdom—is the embryonic form of his "Science of Correspondences". In the journal, this is a private, psychological tool for making sense of his chaotic inner world. In his theological works, it is elevated to a universal hermeneutic, the divine logic by which God created and sustains the universe and the key to unlocking the lost inner meaning of the Bible. The dream of October 29-30, where he sees "the gable-end of the most beautiful palace" shining like the sun and is told he can become a member of an immortal society because of his finished work on "organic forms," marks a critical transition \]. His scientific work on natural forms is explicitly linked to his entry into a higher, spiritual reality. This personal validation becomes a universal principle: the natural world in its entirety is a theater of symbols corresponding to the spiritual world. This doctrine allowed him to reconcile the two warring halves of his identity. It provided a framework where the empirical, scientific study of nature was not opposed to faith but was, in fact, a pathway to understanding spiritual truth, thus resolving the central conflict of the Enlightenment mind.

### **The Grand Man: Heaven as a Divine Anatomy**

Swedenborg's decades of scientific work, particularly his profound knowledge of anatomy, provided the essential framework for his spiritual cosmology. His scientific quest had been to find the soul within the anatomy of the body. Having failed to find this microcosm, his spiritual vision reversed the search: he found the macrocosm of a divine-human anatomy in the structure of heaven itself. His famous description of heaven as a *Maximus Homo*, or Grand Man, is a direct application of his physiological research. He explicitly states that the two kingdoms of heaven, the celestial and the spiritual, correspond to the two central organs of the body: the heart and the lungs, respectively. The celestial kingdom, governed by love, is like the heart and its circulatory system. The spiritual kingdom, governed by wisdom, is like the lungs and the nervous system. Heaven, in his vision, is not an amorphous paradise; it is a divine organism, functioning with the interconnected, systematic precision of the human body he had spent years dissecting. This explains the highly logical and almost "scientific" character of his theological works, which so distinguishes him from other mystics. He is not just describing visions; he is mapping a divine physiology, sublimating his entire scientific career into a new, spiritual science.

### **The Social Order of the Afterlife: A Reflection of 18th-Century Sweden**

The structure of Swedenborg's spiritual world is deeply informed by the social and political realities of his time. His heaven is a highly ordered, functional, and hierarchical society, composed of innumerable communities, each defined by its specific "use" or function. This vision of a purposeful, productive afterlife mirrors the structured, hierarchical society of 18th-century Europe, with its guilds, estates, and clearly defined social roles. Swedenborg's own active and respected role in the Swedish House of Nobles, where he contributed practical memorials on finance, metallurgy, and national policy, shaped his conception of heaven as a place not of eternal repose, but of useful, orderly work.  
Furthermore, his personal and moral judgments on his contemporaries become codified as objective laws of the afterlife. As revealed in his later *Spiritual Diary*, the character flaws he privately identified in colleagues like Anders Swab (pride, corruption) and political figures like King Charles XII (love of dominion) are not just earthly failings; they become the very essence of their eternal state in hell. The love of ruling for its own sake, which he saw in the king, becomes a "diabolical urge" that defines a whole class of infernal spirits. This demonstrates a direct pipeline from personal experience and social observation to theological "truth." The biases and judgments of the 18th-century Swedish nobleman are thus woven into the very fabric of his eternal cosmos, providing a clear example of how the man's environment shaped the prophet's revelation.

## **Conclusion: The Unhidden Man and His Legacy**

Emanuel Swedenborg's vast and intricate theological system, presented as a direct revelation from God, is also an extraordinary act of psychological and intellectual synthesis. The *Journal of Dreams* unhides the man at a moment of profound crisis, revealing the intensely personal origins of his universal doctrines. His work is the product of a brilliant scientific mind that, having reached the limits of its own rational "machine," turned inward to confront its deepest fears and desires. In this crucible, he forged the tools he needed to build a new cosmos, a universe where science and faith, reason and revelation, could coexist in a grand, systematic harmony.  
His struggle with his *proprium*—his pride and worldly ambition—was externalized onto his contemporaries and universalized into a social theory of hell. His powerful libido was sublimated through a consistent symbolic reinterpretation that became the foundation for his Doctrine of Correspondences. His decades of anatomical research provided the blueprint for a heaven structured like a divine human body. The social and political order of 18th-century Sweden offered the model for the functional, hierarchical societies of the afterlife.  
Exposing the "man underneath" and his biases does not necessarily invalidate his spiritual insights. Instead, it provides the very critical lens required for a nuanced understanding of his work. It allows one to read Swedenborg not as an infallible prophet whose words must be accepted or rejected wholesale, but as a complex and brilliant human being whose personal struggles gave birth to a unique and powerful vision. By understanding the psychological, cultural, and scientific origins of his doctrines, the reader can more effectively evaluate the universal truths they may contain, separating the voice of the 18th-century Swedish scientist and nobleman from the timeless spiritual principles he so passionately sought to articulate.
