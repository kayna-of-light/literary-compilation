# **A Critical-Historical Chronology of the Hebrew Bible: Stratigraphy, Redaction, and the Evolution of Scholarly Consensus**

## **I. Introduction: The Science of Biblical Chronology and the Critical Method**

The establishment of a scientific chronology for the books of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) constitutes one of the most rigorous and contested endeavors in the humanities. Unlike modern literary works produced by identifiable authors at fixed points in time, biblical texts are composite documents—literary sediments accumulated over centuries of oral transmission, scribal transcription, and theological redaction. To reconstruct their history requires the rigorous application of the historical-critical method, a discipline that suspends traditional attributions of authorship (e.g., Moses as the author of the Torah, David of the Psalms, Solomon of Proverbs) to examine the text as a human artifact shaped by specific socio-political and religious contexts.1

The scholarly consensus presented in this report is not a monolith but a dynamic equilibrium of prevailing theories. It rests on a triangulation of evidence: linguistic analysis (tracking the diachronic evolution of Biblical Hebrew from Archaic to Late phases), intertextual evidence (how texts cite or presuppose one another), and correlation with the archaeological record of the Ancient Near East.2 A central tenet of this critical approach is the distinction between the *narrative setting* of a text and its *date of composition*. While the stories of the Patriarchs may preserve cultural memories of the second millennium BCE, the written narratives are predominantly products of the first millennium, refracting ancient traditions through the ideological lenses of the divided monarchy, the Babylonian Exile, and the Persian restoration.3

Crucially, this analysis necessitates distinguishing between the primary literary strata of the Pentateuch—specifically the Yahwist (J) and Priestly (P) sources. This distinction is not merely academic; it represents a tectonic shift in the history of Israelite religion, moving from the anthropomorphic, local cults of the monarchic period (J) to the transcendent, centralized, and text-based Judaism of the exilic and post-exilic eras (P).4 This report will navigate these layers, moving canonically through the Torah, Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings), to provide an exhaustive overview of critical scholarship on the dating of the Hebrew Bible.

**II. The Pentateuch (Torah): The Stratigraphy of Israel’s Origins**

The study of the Pentateuch's composition has been dominated for nearly two centuries by the Documentary Hypothesis, classically formulated by Julius Wellhausen in the late 19th century. This hypothesis posits that the Torah is a compilation of four originally independent documents: the Yahwist (J), Elohist (E), Deuteronomist (D), and Priestly (P) sources. While the consensus around the specific dating and existence of the E source has fractured in recent decades, leading to the rise of "Neo-Documentary" and "Supplementary" models, the distinction between the non-Priestly narrative (often designated J or non-P) and the Priestly composition (P) remains the bedrock of critical Pentateuchal studies.3

### **A. The Yahwist (J) Source: The Narrative of National Origins**

#### **1\. Characteristics and Theological Profile**

The Yahwist source is characterized by its consistent use of the divine name YHWH (Yahweh) from the very beginning of human history (Gen 4:26), in direct contradiction to the Priestly view that the name was revealed only to Moses. J presents an anthropomorphic deity who walks in the garden (Gen 3:8), smells the aroma of sacrifices (Gen 8:21), and personally descends to inspect the Tower of Babel (Gen 11:5).4 Narratively, J focuses on the tribe of Judah, the land, and the blessing of the nations through the patriarchs. It is a masterful storytelling source, rich in psychological depth and folklore.7

#### **2\. The Dating Debate: Solomonic vs. Exilic**

**The Classical Consensus (The Solomonic Enlightenment):** For much of the 20th century, critical scholarship followed Wellhausen in dating J to the Solomonic period of the 10th century BCE (c. 950 BCE). Scholars argued that J served as a "charter myth" for the United Monarchy, legitimizing the Davidic dynasty's control over the land of Canaan and its subjugation of Edom (reflected in the Jacob-Esau narrative). The text's confidence, its interest in national boundaries, and its favorable portrayal of Judah were interpreted as reflections of a rising empire.3

**The Revisionist Challenge (The Exilic Yahwist):** Since the mid-1970s, this early dating has faced a formidable challenge, primarily led by John Van Seters, Hans Heinrich Schmid, and Rolf Rendtorff. This "revisionist" or "minimalist" school argues that the J source is not a product of the 10th century but of the **Babylonian Exilic period (6th century BCE)**.8 The arguments for this radical re-dating are manifold:

* **Archaeological Disconnect:** The lack of archaeological evidence for a widespread, literate, and administratively complex "United Monarchy" in the 10th century makes the production of a sophisticated prose epic like J unlikely in that era.  
* **Theological Sophistication:** Van Seters argues that J is not a primitive collector of folklore but a sophisticated historian and theologian who is aware of, and responding to, the Deuteronomistic History (DtrH). For example, J's formulation of the unconditional Abrahamic covenant may be modeled on the royal Davidic covenant rather than preceding it.8  
* **Literary Dependence:** Revisionist scholars suggest J presupposes the prophetic critiques of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, specifically the language of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, rather than serving as their source.3

**Current Scholarly Landscape:** The field is currently divided. American "Neo-Documentarians" (e.g., Joel Baden) continue to defend the pre-exilic existence of J as a distinct document, arguing that its theology is distinct from and earlier than D and P.6 However, many European scholars have moved toward a "Fragmentary" or "Supplementary" hypothesis, viewing the non-Priestly material not as a single "J" document but as a collection of disparate tradition blocks (e.g., the Jacob cycle, the Abraham cycle) that were stitched together and expanded in the exilic or post-exilic period.6 Despite these disagreements, critical scholarship almost universally rejects Mosaic authorship, placing the composition of the Yahwist narratives between the 9th and 6th centuries BCE.10

### **B. The Priestly (P) Source: Order out of Chaos**

#### **1\. Characteristics and Distinctive Theology**

The Priestly source is easily distinguished by its distinct vocabulary, formal style, and theological obsessions. P uses the generic *Elohim* or *El Shaddai* for God until the revelation of the name YHWH to Moses in Exodus 6:3. P is concerned with order, genealogy, ritual purity, and the centralization of the cult. P narratives are often static, symmetrical, and formulaic (e.g., the Creation account in Genesis 1), functioning to structure time (Sabbath) and society (genealogies) rather than to entertain.4

#### **2\. Dating: The Exilic/Post-Exilic Consensus**

While a minority of scholars, notably the "Kaufmann School" (including Avi Hurvitz), argue for a pre-exilic date for P based on linguistic analysis—claiming P preserves archaic language distinct from Late Biblical Hebrew—the majority of critical scholars date the final composition of P to the **Babylonian Exile (586–539 BCE) or the early Persian period (5th century BCE)**.5

* **The Argument from Silence:** P assumes a centralized cult but never mentions the King, the royal court, or the state apparatus. This fits the context of the Exile, where the monarchy had ceased, and the priesthood became the primary leadership structure.13  
* **The Tabernacle as Prototype:** Critical scholars view P's description of the Tabernacle not as a historical desert tent, but as a retrojection of the First Temple (Solomon's) or a utopian blueprint for the Second Temple. It serves to provide a portable "sanctuary in time" for a community in exile.1  
* **Response to Trauma:** P's theology of order (Gen 1\) is read as a counter-narrative to the chaos of the Exile and the Babylonian creation myth *Enuma Elish*. The insistence on Sabbath observance and circumcision (Gen 17\) reflects the need for identity markers in a diaspora context where land and temple were inaccessible.13

### **C. The Holiness Code (H): A Stratum Within P**

Within the book of Leviticus (specifically chapters 17–26), scholars identify a distinct stratum known as the Holiness Code (H).

* **The Consensus Shift:** Historically, Wellhausen viewed H as an earlier law code incorporated into P. However, the current scholarly trend, led by Israel Knohl and Jacob Milgrom, reverses this sequence. The consensus now leans toward **H being later than P**.14  
* **The Argument:** While P restricts holiness to the sanctuary and the priesthood, H democratizes holiness, extending it to the entire land and people ("You shall be holy, for I YHWH your God am holy," Lev 19:2). This theological development suggests H is a **late exilic or post-exilic redaction** (late 6th or 5th century BCE) that edited the P material to broaden its ethical scope.16

### **D. Case Studies in Source Division and Dating**

To illustrate the critical consensus on dating, it is necessary to examine specific narratives where the seams between sources are most visible.

#### **1\. The Creation Narratives (Genesis 1–3)**

Critical scholarship universally recognizes two distinct creation accounts. Genesis 1:1–2:4a is assigned to **P (Exilic/Post-Exilic)**. Its structure is cosmic, orderly, and transcends national boundaries, reflecting the universal monotheism developed during the Exile. Genesis 2:4b–3:24 is assigned to **J (Monarchic/Exilic)**. Its earthy, garden-focused narrative deals with human limitations and the etiology of labor and pain, reflecting the agrarian concerns of the pre-exilic period.4

#### **2\. The Flood Narrative (Genesis 6–9)**

The Flood story is the textbook example of source splicing. Scholars identify two complete, woven strands.

* **J Version:** features seven pairs of clean animals (Gen 7:2) to allow for sacrifice immediately after the flood (Gen 8:20), and lasts 40 days.  
* **P Version:** features two of every animal (Gen 6:19) because sacrifice is not permitted until the Tabernacle is built in Exodus, and lasts 150 days (Gen 7:24), reflecting a specific calendrical concern.  
* **Synthesis:** The redactor (R) combined these during the **Persian period**, preserving both traditions despite the contradictions, creating a unified Torah that legitimized different segments of the returning community.4

#### **3\. The Golden Calf (Exodus 32\)**

This narrative is widely attributed to **E (Elohist)** or a non-Priestly source, but with significant Deuteronomistic redaction.

* **Polemical Dating:** Critical scholars argue this story functions as a polemic against the calves set up by Jeroboam I in the Northern Kingdom (1 Kings 12\) in the late 10th century BCE. The narrator mocks the northern cult by attributing its origin to Aaron's failure.  
* **P's Silence:** Notably, the P source never mentions the Golden Calf. P portrays Aaron as the ideal high priest. This silence is interpreted as P's later attempt to rehabilitate the Aaronic priesthood in the post-exilic period, ignoring the embarrassing traditions preserved in JE.17

#### **4\. The Spy Narrative (Numbers 13–14)**

This account combines **J/E (early)** and **P (late)** layers.

* **J/E Account:** The spies are sent from Kadesh; they report the land is good but the cities are fortified; Caleb alone dissents.  
* **P Account:** The spies explore the *entire* land from Zin to Hamath (Num 13:21); they report the land "devours its inhabitants" (an exilic motif of desolation); Joshua is added alongside Caleb to represent the northern tribes. The P layer is dated to the **Exile**, explaining the failure of the first generation as a theological paradigm for the exilic generation's hope of return.19

### **E. The Poetic Fragments: Ancient Kernels**

Embedded within the prose sources are poetic texts that linguists date significantly earlier, often to the **12th–10th centuries BCE (Archaic Biblical Hebrew)**. These include:

* **The Blessing of Jacob (Genesis 49):** A collection of tribal sayings. The section on Judah (Gen 49:8-12) likely reflects the rise of the Davidic monarchy (10th century), while the Joseph section reflects the strength of the Northern Kingdom (9th/8th century).21  
* **The Song of the Sea (Exodus 15):** Widely considered one of the oldest texts in the Bible. Its archaic morphology and lack of reference to the monarchy suggest a **pre-monarchic date (12th century BCE)**, celebrating a historical victory over Egypt that formed the kernel of the Exodus tradition.22  
* **The Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32):** While traditionally Mosaic, critical scholars date this poem to the **8th century BCE or later**, noting its theological outlook which presupposes the decline of Israel and the threat of Assyria.24

## ---

**III. The Deuteronomistic History (Former Prophets): Narrating the Nation**

The books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings are classified in the Jewish canon as the "Former Prophets." Critical scholarship, following Martin Noth (1943), identifies these books as a unified literary work known as the **Deuteronomistic History (DH)**. This massive history interprets Israel's rise and fall through the theological lens of Deuteronomy: obedience brings blessing, idolatry brings exile.26

### **A. The Double Redaction Hypothesis**

While Noth proposed a single exilic author, the dominant view in American scholarship (following Frank Moore Cross) posits a **Double Redaction** of the history:

1. **Dtr1 (Josianic, c. 620 BCE):** The primary history was composed during the reign of King Josiah as propaganda for his centralizing reforms (2 Kings 22-23). It structured history to culminate in Josiah, the ideal Davidic king who destroys the "high places" (bamot). This edition ended with a hymn of praise to Josiah (2 Kings 23:25).  
2. **Dtr2 (Exilic, c. 550 BCE):** After the shock of Josiah's death (609 BCE) and the fall of Jerusalem (586 BCE), the history was updated to explain the catastrophe. This editor added the final chapters of 2 Kings (the destruction and exile) and inserted passages blaming the disaster on the irreversible sins of Manasseh (2 Kings 21), reshaping the narrative from one of triumph to one of judgment.3

### **B. Joshua: Conquest or Ideological Projection?**

* **Dating:** The book of Joshua is the "fulfillment" chapter of the DH. Its language is thoroughly Deuteronomistic, placing its composition in the **late 7th and 6th centuries BCE**.  
* **Historicity and Origins:** Archaeological evidence contradicts the narrative of a swift, total conquest in the 13th century BCE (e.g., Jericho and Ai were uninhabited at that time).28 Critical consensus views the conquest narrative as a **7th-century ideological construct**, projecting Josianic territorial ambitions (reclaiming the North) back into the mythic past. The "conquest" is a theological map of the Promised Land as defined by the Deuteronomists.30

### **C. Judges: Archaic Tales in a Deuteronomistic Frame**

* **The Framework:** The book is structured by a rigid cyclical theology (Sin \-\> Oppression \-\> Repentance \-\> Deliverance) characteristic of **Dtr1 (7th century)**.  
* **The Song of Deborah (Judges 5):** Embedded within the prose is the poetic "Song of Deborah." Linguistically, this is universally recognized as one of the oldest texts in the Hebrew Bible, dating to the **12th or 11th century BCE**. It depicts a loose tribal confederation and lacks the concept of a united monarchy, offering a window into the authentic pre-state religion of Yahweh.31  
* **Redaction:** The refrain "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judg 21:25) is a pro-monarchic editorial comment, likely added to justify the establishment of the Davidic dynasty, dating the final editing to the **monarchic period**.32

### **D. Samuel: The Rise of Monarchy and Its Sources**

1 and 2 Samuel are composite works containing distinct, older sources that were stitched together by the Deuteronomistic historians.

* **The Ark Narrative (1 Sam 4–6, 2 Sam 6):** This source details the loss and return of the Ark. Scholars debate its date, with some arguing for an early **10th-century** origin (Miller/Roberts) and others for a late **8th-century** anti-Philistine polemic.34  
* **The Succession Narrative (2 Sam 9–20, 1 Kings 1–2):** Traditionally (following Leonhard Rost), this masterful prose narrative was dated to the **10th century BCE** (Solomonic era) as an eyewitness account meant to legitimize Solomon's accession. However, recent scholarship has severely eroded this consensus. Many contemporary scholars now date the Succession Narrative (or "Court History") to the **late monarchic (8th/7th c. BCE) or even exilic periods**, viewing it as a literary novella critiquing the Davidic house rather than contemporary court propaganda. Van Seters argues it is a post-Dtr addition.36  
* **Final Form:** Like the rest of the DH, Samuel was finalized in the **Exile (6th century BCE)**, editing pro-monarchic and anti-monarchic sources into a balanced theological assessment.38

### **E. Kings: The Annals of Decline**

* **Sources:** The author explicitly cites "The Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah/Israel." These citations suggest access to royal archives or literary chronicles.  
* **Redaction:** The final form is indisputably **Exilic (post-561 BCE)**, as it concludes with the release of King Jehoiachin from Babylonian prison (2 Kings 25:27). This ending provides a glimmer of hope for the Davidic line, consistent with Dtr2's agenda. The "Hezekian" redaction hypothesis (that an earlier version of Kings was written under Hezekiah in 700 BCE) remains a strong minority view (Provan, Halpern).26

## ---

**IV. The Latter Prophets: Voices of Judgment and Restoration**

Critical scholarship treats the prophetic books not as transcripts of spoken sermons, but as anthologies of oracles that were collected, expanded, and edited by "schools" of disciples over centuries.

### **A. Isaiah: A Three-Century Anthology**

The Book of Isaiah is the paradigmatic example of a "rolling corpus." Critical scholarship universally rejects single authorship, dividing the book into three main sections.40

1. **Proto-Isaiah (First Isaiah, ch. 1–39):**  
   * **Core:** Contains the authentic oracles of Isaiah ben Amoz, active in Jerusalem during the Assyrian crisis (**c. 740–700 BCE**).  
   * **The Isaiah Apocalypse (ch. 24–27):** These chapters are widely recognized as a much later insertion. Their apocalyptic imagery (cosmic judgment, resurrection of the dead in 26:19) and lack of historical referents lead scholars to date them to the **late Persian or early Hellenistic period (4th–3rd century BCE)**. They represent the transition from prophecy to apocalyptic literature.42  
2. **Deutero-Isaiah (Second Isaiah, ch. 40–55):**  
   * **Context:** This section presupposes the Babylonian Exile. Jerusalem is destroyed, the people are in captivity, and Cyrus the Great is explicitly named as God's anointed (Isa 45:1).  
   * **Dating:** Consensus dates this work to the **late Exilic period (c. 545–539 BCE)**, just before the fall of Babylon. It articulates the first explicit monotheism in the Bible.44  
3. **Trito-Isaiah (Third Isaiah, ch. 56–66):**  
   * **Context:** The setting shifts back to Jerusalem. The Temple is rebuilt (or being rebuilt), but the glorious restoration promised by Second Isaiah has not materialized.  
   * **Dating:** These chapters are dated to the **early Persian period (c. 520–480 BCE)**, reflecting the social conflicts of the restoration community.40

### **B. Jeremiah: The Textual Fluidity**

Jeremiah presents a uniquely complex textual history. The Greek Septuagint (LXX) version is approximately 15% shorter than the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) and arranges the oracles differently (e.g., the Oracles Against the Nations are in the middle in LXX, at the end in MT).46

* **Consensus:** The LXX reflects an earlier Hebrew edition (*Vorlage*), while the MT represents a later, expanded edition.  
* **Composition Layers (Mowinckel's Classification):**  
  * **Source A (Poetic Oracles):** Authentic words of Jeremiah (**627–586 BCE**).  
  * **Source B (Biography):** Narratives about Jeremiah (likely by Baruch).  
  * **Source C (Prose Sermons):** Deuteronomistic sermons. Critical scholars view these as the product of a "Deuteronomistic school" editing Jeremiah's legacy during the **Exile (6th century BCE)**.48  
  * **Final Redaction:** The book continued to grow well into the **Persian/Hellenistic periods** (c. 300-200 BCE), as evidenced by the Qumran fragments (4QJer^b matches LXX; 4QJer^a matches MT).49

### **C. Ezekiel: The Priest in Exile**

* **Context:** Ezekiel is explicitly dated to the Babylonian Exile (dates span **593–571 BCE**). Unlike Isaiah, the book exhibits high structural unity.  
* **Critical View:** Current consensus accepts the substantial unity of the book as the product of the prophet and his school in the **6th century BCE**. The vision of the restored Temple (ch. 40–48) serves as a constitution for the post-exilic community, though some scholars argue it reflects a later priestly redaction.50

### **D. The Book of the Twelve (Minor Prophets)**

Scholars increasingly read the "Twelve" as a unified editorial collection finalized in the Persian period.52

1. **The 8th Century Core (Hosea, Amos, Micah):**  
   * **Amos:** The earliest writing prophet (**c. 760 BCE**). The book ends with a promise of restoring "David's fallen tent" (9:11), widely regarded as an **exilic addition**.53  
   * **Micah:** Ch. 1–3 are authentic 8th-century oracles. Ch. 4–7 (including the "swords into plowshares" prophecy shared with Isaiah) are dated by many to the **exilic or post-exilic periods** due to their presupposition of Jerusalem's destruction and restoration.55  
2. **The 7th Century (Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah):**  
   * **Nahum:** An oracle against Nineveh, dated between the fall of Thebes (663 BCE) and the fall of Nineveh (**612 BCE**).57  
   * **Zephaniah:** Dated to the reign of Josiah (**640–609 BCE**), though likely edited post-exile.58  
3. **The Persian Period (Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi):**  
   * **Haggai & Zechariah 1–8:** Precisely dated to **520–518 BCE**.  
   * **Deutero-Zechariah (9–14):** A sharp distinction is made between Zech 1–8 and 9–14. Ch. 9–14 contain no dates, mention Greece as a major power (9:13), and employ apocalyptic imagery. Consensus dates these to the **late Persian or early Hellenistic period (4th–3rd century BCE)**.59  
   * **Malachi:** Dated to the **mid-5th century BCE**, contemporaneous with Ezra/Nehemiah.61  
4. **The Floating Oracles (Joel, Obadiah, Jonah):**  
   * **Joel:** Makes no mention of a king and implies a functioning Temple. Consensus dates it to the **Persian period (4th century BCE)**.62  
   * **Obadiah:** Addresses Edom's betrayal during the fall of Jerusalem, dated to the **early exilic period (post-586 BCE)**.63  
   * **Jonah:** A narrative *about* a prophet, not a collection of oracles. Its language includes late Aramaisms (e.g., "God of Heaven"). It is widely viewed as a **post-exilic satire (5th–4th century BCE)** critiquing the xenophobic nationalism of Ezra-Nehemiah.64

## ---

**V. The Writings (Ketuvim): Wisdom, Liturgy, and Apocalyptic**

The third section of the canon was the last to be stabilized, containing works that range from the Monarchy to the Hellenistic era.

### **A. The Psalms: A Hymnbook of the Second Temple**

The Psalter is a collection of collections (Books I–V) that grew over centuries.

* **The Elohistic Psalter (Ps 42–83):** This block shows evidence of a systematic editorial activity where the name YHWH was replaced with Elohim. This redaction is likely **Persian (5th/4th c. BCE)**.66  
* **Maccabean Psalms:** While 19th-century scholars dated many psalms to the Maccabean period (2nd c. BCE), current scholarship is more cautious, dating the final compilation to the **Hellenistic period (c. 200 BCE)**, prior to the Qumran manuscripts which show a mostly fixed text.68

### **B. Wisdom Literature: From Solomon to Skepticism**

#### **1\. Proverbs**

* **Core (10–29):** Sentence literature likely originating in the **monarchic period** (Hezekian redaction c. 700 BCE is explicitly mentioned in 25:1).  
* **Prologue (1–9):** The theological discourses are considered the latest part, serving as a hermeneutical introduction. Dated to the **post-exilic period (5th–4th century BCE)** due to the personification of Wisdom, which parallels later Hellenistic thought.69

#### **2\. Job**

* **Prose vs. Poetry:** The consensus separates the **Prose Framework** (ancient folktale) from the **Poetic Dialogue** (sophisticated theological treatise).  
* **Dating:** Linguistic features and the questioning of "retribution theology" place the composition in the **post-exilic period (6th–4th century BCE)**. The Elihu speeches (ch. 32–37) are universally considered a later insertion by a different author.70

#### **3\. Ecclesiastes (Qohelet)**

* **Linguistic Evidence:** Contains Persian loanwords (*pardes*, *pitgam*) and late Hebrew syntax.  
* **Consensus:** Dated to the **Ptolemaic period (3rd century BCE, c. 250 BCE)**. The author's skepticism reflects the Hellenistic zeitgeist.72

### **C. The Five Scrolls (Megillot)**

#### **1\. Song of Songs**

* **Linguistic Evidence:** Contains Persian (*pardes*) and arguably Greek (*appiryon*) loanwords.  
* **Consensus:** Dated to the **post-exilic period (4th–3rd century BCE)**.74

#### **2\. Ruth**

* **Consensus:** Most critical scholars date Ruth to the **post-exilic period (5th–4th century BCE)**, reading it as a polemical counter-narrative to Ezra's ban on intermarriage.76

#### **3\. Lamentations**

* **Dating:** Composed shortly after the fall of Jerusalem in **586 BCE**, likely by those who remained in the land.77

#### **4\. Esther**

* **Dating:** The lack of reference in the Dead Sea Scrolls and late vocabulary suggest a **late Persian or early Hellenistic date (4th–3rd century BCE)**. It is viewed as a historical novella.78

### **D. Daniel: The First Apocalypse**

* **The Consensus:** Daniel is the most confidently dated book in the OT.  
  * **Chapters 1–6:** Court tales from the **Persian/Hellenistic diaspora**.  
  * **Chapters 7–12:** Apocalyptic visions containing detailed "prophecies" accurate up to **167 BCE** but failing to predict the death of Antiochus IV (164 BCE). Final composition is dated to **167–164 BCE**.80

### **E. Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles**

* **Separation:** Since Japhet and Williamson (1970s), the consensus separates Chronicles from Ezra-Nehemiah.  
* **Chronicles:** A rewriting of Samuel-Kings, dated to the **late Persian or early Hellenistic period (c. 350–300 BCE)**.82  
* **Ezra-Nehemiah:** Final redaction dated to the **late 5th or 4th century BCE**.84

## ---

**VI. Conclusion**

The critical consensus reveals the Hebrew Bible as a library overwhelmingly produced in the **First Millennium BCE**, specifically between the late monarchy and the Hellenistic era. The **Babylonian Exile (586 BCE)** is the definitive watershed. The Torah, History, and Prophets were all decisively shaped by the need to explain this trauma and reconstruct a community around a text rather than a king.
