# **The Lukan Dissonance: A Critical Forensic Examination of the Theological and Political Divergence Between the Third Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles**

## **I. Introduction: The Problem of the Canonical Sequel**

The canonical coupling of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles constitutes the most significant narrative corpus in the New Testament, widely regarded by modern scholarship as a two-volume work (*Luke-Acts*) by a single author. This literary unity is a foundational axiom of New Testament studies, supported by the shared dedication to Theophilus, stylistic homogeneity, and the explicit reference in Acts 1:1 to a "former treatise".1 However, a rigorous critical analysis reveals a profound theological and historical tension lying beneath the surface of this literary unity. While the Gospel of Luke preserves a "Jamesian" theology—characterized by a rigorous ethic of poverty, a preservation of Jewish piety, and a prophetic critique of wealth that aligns with the Epistle of James and the primitive Jerusalem church—the Book of Acts functions as a political corrective. Acts endeavors to "harmonize" the figure of Paul, domesticating his radical theology to fit within an institutionalized, Petrine framework, and smoothing over the bitter intra-church conflicts evidenced in the authentic Pauline epistles.

This report investigates this discrepancy, positing that the divergence between Luke and Acts is not merely a matter of genre or chronology, but reflects a deliberate, second-century ecclesial strategy. The perceived contradictions are not merely historical errors but the scars of a theological struggle to forge a unified "Catholic" church out of disparate and warring traditions. By analyzing the "Jamesian" substrate of the Gospel, the "taming" of Paul in Acts, the suppression of the Ebionite/Jewish-Christian voice, and the anti-Marcionite agenda of the Lukan redactor, this study demonstrates that the text functions as an irenic synthesis designed to neutralize the polarities of the apostolic age.3

The inquiry begins by isolating the distinct theological profile of the Third Gospel. Unlike Mark, which focuses on the suffering Son of Man, or Matthew, which presents the New Moses, Luke presents a Jesus whose ethical and social teachings bear a striking, almost genetic, resemblance to the Epistle of James and the theology of the Jerusalem "Pillars." This "Jamesian" orientation is then juxtaposed with the political theology of Acts, which systematically dismantles the radical independence of Paul found in his own letters (Galatians, Corinthians) and reconstructs him as a compliant servant of the Jerusalem hierarchy. This "Lukan Dissonance" serves as the primary analytical lens through which we must view the formation of early Christian orthodoxy.

**II. The Jamesian Matrix of the Third Gospel**

To understand the dissonance between the two volumes, one must first confront the distinct theological DNA of the Third Gospel. While tradition and much of modern scholarship have focused on Luke as the "Gentile" Gospel, written by a companion of Paul, the internal evidence suggests a more complex provenance. The Gospel of Luke contains a strata of material—often designated as "L" or "Special Luke"—that aligns intimately with the theological concerns of James the Just and the Jewish-Christian communities of Palestine. This "Jamesian" matrix is characterized by a theology of reversal, a rigorous critique of wealth, and a staunch adherence to Torah piety.

### **2.1 The Theology of Reversal and the *Anawim***

The Gospel of Luke is uniquely preoccupied with the *Anawim*—the "poor" or "humble" of the Lord. This focus is not merely philanthropic or humanitarian; it is eschatological and distinctively Jewish-Christian. It reflects the self-designation of the earliest Jerusalem church, the *Ebionim* ("The Poor Ones"), who looked to James as their leader.5

#### **The Magnificat as a Jamesian Manifesto**

The programmatic hymn of Mary, the Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55), establishes the theological trajectory of the Gospel before Jesus is even born. Mary declares: "He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty" (Luke 1:52-53). This theology of radical socio-economic reversal is echoed precisely in the Epistle of James: "Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, and the rich in his humiliation" (James 1:9-10).7 The structural and thematic parallels suggest that Luke is drawing upon a liturgical tradition rooted in the same community that produced the Epistle of James. Both texts envision a God who is not merely the savior of the soul but the vindicator of the oppressed and the judge of the economic elite.

#### **The Beatitudes and Woes**

The divergence between Luke and Matthew in the Sermon on the Mount/Plain is critical evidence for Luke's Jamesian orientation. Matthew spiritualizes the beatitudes: "Blessed are the poor *in spirit*" (Matt 5:3). Luke, however, preserves the raw, economic force of the saying: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God" (Luke 6:20). Even more telling is Luke's inclusion of the corresponding "Woes" (Luke 6:24-26): "But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry."

These woes find their only canonical parallel in the Epistle of James 5:1-6: "Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you... You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence." The linguistic and thematic affinity between Luke's "Sermon on the Plain" and the Epistle of James is so strong that some scholars argue for a direct literary dependence or a shared source (Q or a Jewish-Christian wisdom collection).9 Both texts operate within a "wisdom" framework that views wealth not as a sign of divine blessing (the traditional Deuteronomic view) but as a spiritual liability and a source of oppression.

### **2.2 The Lazarus Parable and the Ebionite Connection**

Unique to Luke is the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). This narrative is a cornerstone of the Jamesian/Ebionite theology embedded in the Gospel.

* **The Sin of Wealth:** The rich man (often traditionally named Dives) is condemned not for active vice, idolatry, or sexual immorality, but simply for being rich and failing to practice economic solidarity with the poor man at his gate. This aligns perfectly with James 1:27, which defines "pure religion" as caring for orphans and widows and keeping oneself unstained by the world.  
* **The Significance of Lazarus:** Lazarus (Eleazar, "God helps") is the only named character in any of Jesus' parables. Some scholars have noted the etymological link between "Lazarus" and the sect of the *Ebionites* ("The Poor Ones"). The parable may well be an Ebionite polemic against the Sadducean aristocracy or the wealthy Pauline Christians who neglected the poor of Jerusalem.5  
* **The Sufficiency of Torah:** The theological climax of the parable—"If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead" (Luke 16:31)—is a stunning affirmation of Jewish scripture. It suggests that the Law and Prophets are sufficient for salvation and ethical guidance, a view that stands in tension with the Pauline insistence that the Law cannot save. It essentially argues that the Resurrection (the cornerstone of Pauline theology) is secondary to the ethical demands of the Torah.11

### **2.3 Torah Piety and the Temple**

While Luke is traditionally viewed as a Gentile writing for Gentiles, his Gospel exhibits a profound reverence for the Temple and the Law that aligns with the portrait of James the Just found in Josephus and Hegesippus, rather than the iconoclastic Paul of Galatians.

**The Temple Bookends:** The Gospel begins with Zechariah serving in the Temple (Luke 1:9) and ends with the disciples "continually in the temple blessing God" (Luke 24:53). This inclusio frames the entire Jesus event within the precincts of Jewish cultic piety. Unlike Mark, who emphasizes the tearing of the Temple curtain and the judgment on the Temple, Luke portrays the Temple as the site of divine revelation and pious devotion.

**The Observant Jesus:** The infancy narratives (Luke 1-2) depict a family strictly observant of the Torah. Jesus is circumcised on the eighth day, and his parents offer the sacrifice of the poor (turtledoves) for Mary's purification "according to the Law of the Lord" (Luke 2:22-24). This emphasis on *Torah-observance* contradicts the Marcionite rejection of the "Creator's Law" and aligns with the Jamesian insistence that faith must be perfected by works (James 2:22).12

**The Validity of the Law:** In Luke 16:17, immediately following a teaching on money, Jesus asserts, "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail." This high view of the Law's durability stands in tension with the Pauline "end of the law" (Rom 10:4) but sits comfortably within the Jacobite theology of the "perfect law of liberty" (James 1:25).14

### **2.4 Comparison of Ethical Themes: Luke vs. James**

The following table illustrates the dense network of parallels between the ethical material in Luke and the Epistle of James, supporting the thesis of a shared "Jamesian" theological substrate.

| Theological Theme | Epistle of James | Gospel of Luke | Shared Insight |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Woes to the Rich** | "Come now, you rich, weep and howl..." (5:1) | "Woe to you who are rich..." (6:24) | Wealth is an impediment to the Kingdom; eschatological reversal is imminent. |
| **Judging Others** | "Do not grumble against one another... the Judge is standing at the door" (5:9) | "Judge not, and you will not be judged" (6:37) | Community ethics require suspension of judgment and radical mercy. |
| **Asking/Giving** | "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously" (1:5) | "Give, and it will be given to you" (6:38); "Ask and it will be given" (11:9) | God is the generous patron; disciples must emulate this generosity. |
| **Hearing vs. Doing** | "Be doers of the word, and not hearers only" (1:22) | "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?" (6:46) | Orthopraxy (doing) takes precedence over orthodoxy (verbal confession). |
| **Friendship with World** | "Friendship with the world is enmity with God" (4:4) | "No servant can serve two masters... God and Mammon" (16:13) | Radical dualism between the values of the Kingdom and the economic system. |

**III. The "Pauline" Harmonization in Acts: A Political Project**

If the Gospel of Luke preserves a Jamesian ethic, the Acts of the Apostles appears to be a deliberate attempt to neutralize the conflict between this ethic and the growing influence of Paulinism. The author of Acts engages in a sophisticated literary program to "tame" Paul, stripping him of his radical independence and subordinating him to the authority of the Jerusalem church (James and Peter). This process involves rewriting history to create a seamless continuity between the Twelve and Paul, effectively erasing the "Damascus Divergence."

### **3.1 The "Hostile Takeover" of Pauline Biography**

The most glaring discrepancies arise when comparing Paul’s own autobiographical statements in Galatians with the narrative of Acts. These are not minor historical errors but tendentious redactions designed to alter the political reality of the early church.3

#### **The Myth of Subservience**

In **Galatians 1**, Paul vehemently asserts his independence: "I did not confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me".3 He insists on a three-year gap before seeing Peter and James, and even then, only for a short visit. He emphasizes that his gospel came by direct revelation, not human tradition. This assertion is polemical; Paul is defending himself against charges that he is a subordinate or a renegade.

In **Acts 9**, however, Paul attempts to join the disciples in Jerusalem almost immediately after his conversion. He is sponsored by Barnabas and moves freely among the apostles, preaching in Jerusalem. Acts portrays Paul as a subordinate emissary of Jerusalem, receiving letters of authority from them. The narrative effectively "domesticates" Paul, making him a dutiful lieutenant of the Jerusalem hierarchy rather than a charismatic rival. The Lukan Paul is a "company man," integrated into the apostolic succession, whereas the Historical Paul is a "lone ranger" fighting for the legitimacy of his independent gospel.

#### **The Apostolic Decree and the Erasure of Conflict**

**Acts 15** depicts a formal Council where James issues a decree (abstention from idol meat, blood, strangled animals, and sexual immorality) that is binding on Gentile converts. Paul is portrayed as accepting and delivering this decree (Acts 16:4).

However, in **1 Corinthians 8 and 10**, Paul discusses food offered to idols at length and *never mentions this decree*. His argument is based on conscience and liberty ("eat whatever is sold in the meat market"), which directly contradicts the Apostolic Decree's prohibition.16 If Paul had agreed to such a decree, his silence in Corinthians is inexplicable. The Lukan narrative likely invents or retrojects a legal consensus that never existed to portray a unified church, smoothing over the deep fissures regarding the Law that Paul exposes in Galatians.

### **3.2 The "Nazarite" Paul: A Ritual Fiction?**

One of the most profound contradictions is the portrayal of Paul's Jewish observance in Acts, specifically the "Nazarite Vow" incident.

In **Acts 21:20-26**, James confronts Paul with rumors that he teaches Jews to "forsake Moses." To disprove this, James commands Paul to sponsor four men taking a Nazarite vow and to purify himself in the Temple. Acts portrays Paul as meekly complying, paying for their sacrifices (which involved *animal sacrifice* for sin), and entering the Temple to prove he "walks orderly and keeps the law."

It is historically implausible that the Paul who wrote **Galatians**—declaring that "if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you" (Gal 5:2) and that the Law is a "curse" (Gal 3:13)—would participate in a Temple ritual involving animal sacrifice to prove his Torah observance.18 This "Lukan Paul" is a devout, Law-abiding Pharisee who never truly breaks with Judaism. This creates a "safe" Paul for Jewish-Christian readers but obliterates the radical soteriology of the historical Paul.

### **3.3 The "Bridge-Man" Peter and Structural Parallelism**

Acts engages in a structural parallelism (*Syncrisis*) that blurs the lines between Peter and Paul to facilitate reconciliation. This literary device was common in ancient biography (e.g., Plutarch's *Parallel Lives*) and serves a rhetorical purpose: to show that the two heroes are equal and in agreement.

* **Petrine Paulinism:** In Acts 10-11, it is Peter, not Paul, who initiates the Gentile mission through the conversion of Cornelius. Peter defends Gentile inclusion by arguing for salvation by grace (Acts 15:11), effectively stealing Paul's theological thunder and making Peter the first "Pauline" apostle.  
* **Pauline Petrinism:** Conversely, Paul in Acts performs miracles identical to Peter's (Peter heals with a shadow, Acts 5:15; Paul with a handkerchief, Acts 19:12; Peter raises Dorcas, Acts 9; Paul raises Eutychus, Acts 20\) and is depicted as a faithful Jew.20

The bitter confrontation between Peter and Paul at Antioch, recorded in Galatians 2:11-14 ("I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned"), is completely erased from Acts. Instead, Acts 15:39 records a "sharp contention" between Paul and Barnabas over Mark—a personnel dispute that displaces the deep theological rupture recorded in Galatians.22 This suppression of conflict is the hallmark of Acts' "Early Catholic" agenda, rewriting history to present a unified front against heresy.

**IV. The Politics of Harmonization: Tendency Criticism Revisited**

The discrepancies between Luke and Acts are best understood through the lens of *Tendency Criticism* (*Tendenzkritik*), pioneered by F.C. Baur and refined by modern scholars like John Knox, Joseph Tyson, and Richard Pervo. This framework posits that Acts is a document written to mediate between warring factions of the early church.

### **4.1 The Anti-Marcionite Hypothesis**

A significant body of scholarship suggests that Acts (and the final redaction of Luke) was written in the early-to-mid second century (c. 110-120 CE) specifically to counter **Marcion of Sinope**.4

* **The Marcionite Threat:** Marcion rejected the Old Testament and the "Jewish God," accepting only a truncated Gospel of Luke (the *Evangelion*) and ten Pauline letters. He posited a radical discontinuity between Law and Gospel and viewed Paul as the only true apostle. Marcion's movement was arguably the greatest threat to the emerging orthodox church in the second century.  
* **Acts as Counter-Narrative:** To reclaim Paul from the Marcionites, the "Proto-Orthodox" author of Acts wrote a history that anchored Paul firmly in the Old Testament. In Acts, Paul constantly appeals to "the Law and the Prophets," preaches in synagogues, and affirms the resurrection of the dead (which Marcionites denied in the fleshly sense). By binding Paul to Peter and the Jerusalem church, Acts neutralizes the Marcionite claim that Paul was a solitary revealer of a new God.25  
* **The Priority of Marcion's Gospel?** Recent scholarship by Matthias Klinghardt and others argues that Marcion's *Evangelion* may actually be older than canonical Luke, or that both derive from a "Proto-Luke." If canonical Luke is a later expansion of the Marcionite text, then the "Jamesian" elements (like the infancy narratives and the emphasis on the law) may have been added specifically to "Judaize" the text and reclaim it from the Marcionites.23

### **4.2 The Eclipse of James and the "Desposyni"**

While the Gospel of Luke preserves "Jamesian" ethics, the narrative of Acts systematically marginalizes James the Just to elevate the Peter-Paul dyad.

* **The Missing Dynastic Leadership:** In Galatians and church tradition (Hegesippus, Clement), James is the supreme leader (bishop) of the Jerusalem Church, to whom even Peter answers. In Acts, James makes a brief, authoritative appearance in Chapter 15 and 21, but is otherwise sidelined. The *Desposyni* (family of Jesus) are replaced by the "Twelve" and the "Apostles," shifting authority from a bloodline dynasty (which might have been too "Jewish" or "Ebionite" for the Gentile church) to an institutional office.28  
* **The Fate of James:** Acts records the martyrdom of James the son of Zebedee (Acts 12:2) but is strangely silent on the martyrdom of James the brother of Jesus (c. 62 CE), despite his prominence. This silence allows Luke to avoid the messy reality of the Jewish-Christian leadership's destruction and the subsequent rise of the more radical, anti-Roman Ebionites.28 By ending the narrative before the death of James (and Paul), Luke maintains the illusion of a successful, unbroken apostolic age.

**V. Economic Ethics: From Renunciation to Benefaction**

The transition from the Gospel of Luke to Acts marks a shift from a radical, eschatological ethic of poverty to a sustainable, institutional ethic of benefaction—a shift tailored for a Greco-Roman audience represented by "Theophilus."

### **5.1 The Radicalism of the Gospel**

In the Gospel, the demands are absolute: "So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:33). The wealthy are intrinsically compromised; the "mammon of unrighteousness" is filthy. The ethos is one of *abandonment*—leaving nets, homes, and families.8 This reflects the "Jamesian" view of the world as hostile and the rich as oppressors.

### **5.2 The Institutionalism of Acts**

In Acts, the demand for total renunciation morphs into *communal philanthropy*.

* **Barnabas and Ananias:** We see the sale of property (Acts 4:32-37), but it is voluntary ("While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?" Acts 5:4). The focus shifts from "becoming poor" to "being a benefactor."  
* **Greco-Roman Reciprocity:** Acts presents the church as an ideal philosophical community (like the Pythagoreans) where "friends hold all things in common." This makes the movement palatable to wealthy patrons like Theophilus. The radical "woe to the rich" is replaced by the praise of Cornelius (a wealthy centurion) and Lydia (a merchant), who use their wealth to support the mission rather than abandoning it.32  
* **The Collection Omission:** Significantly, Acts never explicitly mentions Paul’s great "Collection for the Saints" which dominates his letters (Rom 15, 1 Cor 16, 2 Cor 8-9). This collection was likely a tribute to Jerusalem, acknowledging their authority. Acts omits it perhaps to downplay Paul’s subservience or to avoid the implication that the Gentile church was financially tributary to the Jewish church.34

## ---

**VI. The Unresolved Ending and Roman Apologetics**

The abrupt ending of Acts—with Paul under house arrest in Rome, "preaching the kingdom of God... with all boldness and without hindrance" (Acts 28:31)—is a focal point of scholarly debate regarding the book's purpose.

### **6.1 Political Exoneration (*Apologeticus pro Paulo*)**

The omission of Paul's martyrdom (c. 64 CE under Nero) is widely seen as a political choice. To narrate Paul's execution by the state would undermine Luke's apologetic theme: that Christianity is innocent of sedition and compatible with Roman order.

Throughout Acts, Roman officials (Gallio, Felix, Festus, Agrippa) repeatedly declare Paul innocent (Acts 18:14; 23:29; 25:25; 26:32). Luke is eager to show that any conflict is the result of *Jewish* agitation, not Christian subversion. Ending with Paul preaching "unhindered" in the heart of the Empire serves as a literary exoneration.36

### **6.2 The Theological "End of the Earth"**

Theologically, the ending signals the completion of the programmatic mandate of Acts 1:8 ("Jerusalem... to the end of the earth"). With Paul in Rome, the transition from the Jewish capital to the Gentile capital is complete. The rejection of the Gospel by the Roman Jews (Acts 28:25-28) serves as the final justification for the Gentile mission: "Let it be known to you then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen." The "Jamesian" mission to the circumcision is effectively closed; the "Pauline" universal church has triumphed.

## ---

**VII. The Content of the "Proto-Luke" (The Evangelion)**

Critical reconstruction of the "Proto-Luke" (or Marcion's *Evangelion*)—supported by scholars such as Adolf von Harnack, John Knox, and Matthias Klinghardt—reveals a text that was shorter, ethically rigorous, and strikingly devoid of the "harmonizing" features found in the canonical version. This reconstructed text preserves the "Jamesian" ethical core before it was wrapped in an "Orthodox" political framework.

### **7.1 The Missing "Orthodox" Wrapper**

The most distinct feature of the Proto-Luke is what it *lacked*. The earliest layer of the text appears to have been stripped of the narrative elements that anchor Jesus in Jewish institutional history and Roman imperial time.

* **No Birth Narratives (Chapters 1–2):** The Proto-Gospel contained no infancy account—no Zechariah, no Annunciation, no manger, and no shepherds. These chapters are widely considered later "Pastoral" additions designed to counter Marcionism by anchoring Jesus in the Creator’s world (history) and the Davidic line (prophecy).20  
* **No Genealogy (Chapter 3):** The lineage tracing Jesus back to Adam and God was absent. The Proto-Gospel was not concerned with biological descent or dynastic legitimacy.  
* **No Baptism by John:** In the *Evangelion*, Jesus is not baptized by John the Baptist, avoiding any subordination of Jesus to the "Old Testament" prophet.  
* **The "Alien" Descent:** Instead of a birth, the text began (roughly at **Luke 3:1** and **4:31**) with Jesus *descending* from heaven directly to Capernaum in Galilee, appearing fully grown and empowered as a charismatic intervener rather than a biological product of history.20

### **7.2 The "Jamesian" Core (The 'L' Source Material)**

Once the narrative begins, the content is heavily dominated by what scholars call the **"L" Source** (material found only in Luke) and **"Q"** (sayings). This material forms the "Jamesian" substrate—a theology of radical poverty, reversal, and ethical dualism that aligns with the Epistle of James and the Ebionites.

#### **The Radical Ethics of Reversal**

* **The Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6):** Unlike Matthew’s spiritualized "poor in spirit," Proto-Luke preserved the raw economic "Blessings to the Poor" (6:20) and, crucially, the **"Woes to the Rich"** (6:24–26). These "Woes" have no parallel in Matthew/Mark but align perfectly with **James 5:1** ("Come now, you rich, weep and howl...").  
* **The "Travel Narrative" Parables:** The central section (Luke 9–19) contains the unique "L" parables that preach a theology of works and reversal central to the Jerusalem Church:  
  * **The Good Samaritan (Luke 10):** A critique of the Temple priesthood (Priest/Levite) in favor of *doing* the law of love (James 2:8).  
  * **The Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16):** An explicitly "Ebionite" text where the rich man is damned for wealth and the poor man (Lazarus) is saved. This reflects **James 2:5-6** ("Has not God chosen the poor... but the rich oppress you?").38  
  * **Total Renunciation:** The Proto-Luke contained the absolute demands for renunciation that the later church often softened, such as "Any one of you who does not renounce **all that he has** cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:33).

### **7.3 The Ending: A Spiritual Resurrection?**

The ending of the Proto-Luke suggests a different Resurrection Christology than the canonical version. Textual evidence (including the "Western Non-Interpolations") suggests the original text lacked the anti-Docetic "flesh and bones" proofs (Luke 24:39) and the eating of fish. In the Proto-Gospel, the resurrection was likely depicted as a spiritual reality or a visionary appearance, aligning more with Paul's "spiritual body" (1 Cor 15\) than the later orthodox insistence on physical resuscitation.

## ---

**VIII. Conclusion: The Lukan Synthesis**

The discrepancy between Luke and Acts is not an accident of history but the result of a deliberate theological and political project. The author, writing likely in the early second century, faced a fractured landscape: radical Jewish Christians (Ebionites) claiming James and rejecting Paul; radical Gentile Christians (Marcionites) claiming Paul and rejecting the Old Testament; and the Roman state viewing the new sect with suspicion.

* **The Gospel of Luke** co-opts the Jamesian/Ebionite ethical tradition, preserving the moral rigor and piety of the Jerusalem church to anchor Jesus in Jewish righteousness and prophetic social justice.  
* **The Acts of the Apostles** co-opts Paul, stripping him of his antinomian radicalism and Gnostic tendencies, and harmonizing him with Peter and James to create a unified "Catholic" front.

Thus, the "Jamesian view for a Greek-Roman culture" in Luke and the "harmonized Paul" in Acts are two sides of the same coin: a *via media* designed to forge a stable, unified, and politically safe orthodoxy out of the volatile fires of the apostolic age. The "contradictions" are the seams of this fabrication, visible only when the canonical tapestry is unraveled by critical inquiry.

### **Table 1: The Lukan Dissonance Matrix**

| Theme | Gospel of Luke ("Jamesian" Influence) | Acts of the Apostles ("Harmonized" Paul) | Historical/Pauline Reality (Epistles) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **View of the Law** | Jesus is Torah-observant; Law will not fail (16:17). | Paul takes Nazarite vow; claims believing "all things in the Law" (24:14). | Paul calls Law a "curse" (Gal 3:13) and "rubbish" (Phil 3:8). |
| **Economics** | Radical Renunciation: "Woe to the rich" (6:24); "Sell all" (18:22). | Benefaction/Patronage: Wealthy support the church (Cornelius, Lydia). | Paul collects funds for Jerusalem "poor" but works to support himself. |
| **Apostolic Authority** | The Twelve are foundational; Family of Jesus marginalized. | Paul submits to James/Jerusalem decrees; Peter is the "bridge." | Paul asserts absolute independence from Jerusalem "Pillars" (Gal 1-2). |
| **Eschatology** | Imminent Reversal: "Kingdom is yours" (6:20). | Delayed Parousia: "Times and seasons" not for you (1:7); focus on history/mission. | Imminent Expectation: "The time is short" (1 Cor 7:29). |
| **Christology** | Adoptionist tendencies? (Baptism, Transfiguration). | Anti-Docetic: "Flesh and bones" resurrection (24:39). | Spiritual Body: "Flesh and blood cannot inherit" (1 Cor 15:50). |
