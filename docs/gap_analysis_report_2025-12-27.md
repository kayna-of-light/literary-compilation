## Evidence Presentation Gaps (Cherry-Picking Patterns)

### Pattern 1: Emphasizing Confirmatory Cases

**NDEs**: Blissful experiences emphasized; distressing experiences minimized  
**DOPS**: Strongest cases (Leininger, Hammons) featured; overall verification rates absent  
**Paul**: Confrontational passages highlighted; humility passages downplayed  
**Gnosticism**: Dualist Paul emphasized; bodily resurrection ignored  

**Impact**: Framework appears to seek confirmation rather than truth  
**Solution**: Present full statistical distributions; engage strongest counterevidence

### Pattern 2: Anecdotal vs. Statistical

**Current**: Remarkable individual cases presented as representative  
**Missing**: Overall rates, success/failure ratios, null findings  

**Impact**: Inflates evidential strength; cherry-picking accusation  
**Solution**: Statistical context for all empirical claims

### Pattern 3: Selective Application of Methods

**Applied**: Historical-critical method to Bible (identifying sources, redactions, agendas)  
**Not Applied**: Same method to Swedenborg (cultural influences, theological evolution)  

**Impact**: Methodological asymmetry; double standard  
**Solution**: Either apply HCM to all texts or acknowledge differential treatment as theological stance

- Gospel genre implications for historicity
- Textual criticism (current vs. 19th-century methods)
- Passion narrative sources
- Historical Jesus methodology

**Node expansion**: +8 nodes needed for balanced coverage

### Gnostic Analysis (8% → Target 12%)

**Current gaps**:
- Category definition rigor

## Critical Issues Requiring External Research

### RED FLAG: Blocks Progress Until Resolved

1. **Falsifiability Specification** — What would falsify major claims? If nothing, reframe as faith commitments
2. **Epistemological Status** — Is this theology or integrated science? Cannot be both without independent validation
3. **Methodological Asymmetry** — Apply HCM to Swedenborg or acknowledge differential treatment

### HIGH PRIORITY: Fundamental Revision Needed

4. **CDE Unfalsifiability** — Specify testable predictions or reframe as philosophical framework
5. **Evidence Overreach** — Statistical context for all empirical claims (NDE, DOPS overall rates)
6. **Alternative Theories** — Engage Dual Inheritance Theory, dying brain hypothesis seriously
7. **Gnostic Impulse Category** — Tighten definition or acknowledge as theological typology
8. **Correspondence Validation** — Independent methodology or admission of circularity

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Strengthen Credibility

9. **Cherry-Picking** — Present full data distributions, not just confirming cases
10. **Cross-Cultural NDE Data** — Being identification across religious backgrounds
11. **Proto-Luke Status** — Scholarly hypothesis or framework inference?
12. **Oral Tradition Stability** — Narrative vs. spatial memory distinction

## Research Question Optimization by System

### Gemini Deep Research (27 questions, 64%)

**Why GDR**: Extended context, multi-source synthesis, web access, complex analysis

**Question Types**:
- Epistemological analysis (two-tiered epistemology, falsifiability, confirmation bias)
- Comparative theory assessment (CDE vs. DIT, dying brain vs. afterlife)
- Scholarly consensus surveys (Jesus-Paul, proto-myths, oral tradition)
- Historical context (Swedenborg's influences, 18th-century intellectual milieu)
- Methodological validation (HCM applied to Swedenborg, correspondence consistency)

**Strengths**: Can handle philosophical sophistication, integrate across disciplines, trace scholarly debates

### NotebookLM (7 questions, 17%)

**Why NLM**: Direct access to primary theological texts, focused queries, technical precision

**Question Types**:
- Swedenborgian doctrine specifics (evolution across corpus, influx mechanics)
- Pauline passages (humility vs. authority language)
- Gospel genre (Burridge's *bioi* implications)
- Textual criticism details (Western Non-Interpolations)
- Patristic theology (Desert Fathers on *philautia*)

**Constraint**: ~500 character limit requires extreme concision; one focused question per query

### NDE Statistical Repository (8 questions, 19%)

**Why NDE**: Empirical data, quantitative analysis, phenomenological breakdowns

**Question Types**:
- Frequency distributions (life review empathetic component, distressing NDEs)
- Cross-cultural comparisons (being identification by religious background)
- Correlation studies (features vs. aftereffects)
- Verification rates (veridical perception success/failure)
- Demographic analysis (who reports what features)

**Strengths**: Statistical rigor framework currently lacks; falsifiable empirical claims

## Conclusion

The Divine Bricolage framework demonstrates impressive erudition and creative synthesis but exhibits fundamental weaknesses in epistemological clarity, empirical rigor, and methodological consistency. This gap analysis has identified:

- **42 targeted research questions** addressing critical issues
- **7 domains** with specific coverage/validation gaps
- **15 HIGH priority** questions that could require framework reframing
- **3 external research systems** optimally suited for different question types

**Primary recommendation**: Address HIGH PRIORITY epistemological questions (#1-6) FIRST. Framework's entire intellectual status depends on clarifying whether it's:
1. **Theology informing interpretation of science** (defensible, honest)
2. **Science validating theology** (current claim; requires falsifiability and independent validation)

Until this core ambiguity is resolved, expansion into additional domains risks building on unstable foundation.

**Secondary recommendation**: Replace anecdotal evidence with statistical distributions for all empirical claims (Phases 2-3). Framework's consciousness studies are its strongest empirical anchor—must present full data, not cherry-picked remarkable cases.

**Final note**: Framework's greatest strength (comprehensiveness) is also its vulnerability (unfalsifiability). The research questions in this analysis are designed to test whether framework can be challenged by evidence or whether it's a closed system that explains all outcomes post-hoc. Intellectual honesty requires openness to revision.

**Report Status**: Complete  
**Next Action**: Execute research questions according to phased strategy  
**Integration**: Update knowledge graph as findings emerge  
**Monitoring**: Track resolution progress in `research_questions.md`
