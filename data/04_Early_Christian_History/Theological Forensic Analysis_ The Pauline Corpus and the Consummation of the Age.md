# **Theological Forensic Analysis: The Pauline Corpus and the Consummation of the Age**

## **1\. Introduction: The Pneumatic Hermeneutic and the Apostolic Crisis**

The history of Christian dogma has traditionally been viewed through the lens of ecumenical councils and patristic consensus, with the Epistles of the Apostle Paul serving as the architectural blueprint for soteriology and ecclesiology. However, the pneumatic experiences of Emanuel Swedenborg, recorded in his *Spiritual Diary* (Vol. IV), offer a radical disruption of this historical narrative. By shifting the locus of verification from earthly councils to the "world of spirits"—the realm of causes where the interior states of historical figures are laid bare—Swedenborg presents a devastating critique of Pauline theology. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of these claims, validating Swedenborg’s pneumatological observations by juxtaposing them with the canonical texts of the New Testament. The analysis focuses on the distinct nature of Paul’s inspiration versus the Gospels, the spiritual etiology of the conflict between Paul and Peter, the soteriological schism of "Faith Alone," and the Christological implications of the "Divine Human."

The central thesis emerging from the *Spiritual Diary* is that the Christian Church has been brought to its consummation (end) primarily through the elevation of Pauline doctrine over the Evangelic imperatives of the Lord. The data suggests that Paul’s writings, while historically permitted, lack the internal spiritual sense that characterizes the Word of God, serving instead as a vehicle for self-derived intelligence and the love of dominion.1 This theological displacement—substituting the "Writings" of an apostle for the "Word" of the Lord—is identified as the spiritual cause of the "Dragon" and "Babylon" phenomena described in the Apocalypse.

## **2\. The Nature of Authority: Self-Derived Inspiration versus Divine Dictation**

A critical demarcation in Swedenborgian theology is the distinction between the *Word* (Sacred Scripture containing an infinite internal sense) and *Writings* (doctrinal expositions derived from human intelligence, however illuminated). The *Spiritual Diary* provides categorical evidence that the Epistles of Paul fall into the latter category, fundamentally altering their authoritative status relative to the Gospels.

### **2.1 The Absence of the Internal Sense in Pauline Epistles**

The most profound structural critique of Paul in the *Spiritual Diary* is the explicit denial of an internal sense within his epistles. Entry 4824 states unequivocally: "That the Epistles of Paul have not an internal sense is known in the other life".1 In the Swedenborgian framework, the "internal sense" is the celestial and spiritual verifycation of the text; it is the presence of the Divine Truth in every "jot and tittle," corresponding to the form of heaven itself.

Entries 4671 and 5620 describe the nature of the Word in heaven, noting that even the curvature of Hebrew letters contains divine arcana perceptible to celestial angels.1 This organic connection between the literal text and the Divine Human is what constitutes "The Word." Paul’s writings, however, are described as having no such correspondence. Entry 4824 asserts: "Paul was not permitted to take one parable, not even a doctrine, from the Lord, and to expound and unfold it; but he took all things from himself".1

This distinction finds textual validation in the New Testament itself. The Gospels present the Lord speaking directly ("The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life," John 6:63). In contrast, Paul frequently qualifies his instructions with markers of self-derived authority, such as in 1 Corinthians 7:12 ("But to the rest speak I, not the Lord") or 1 Corinthians 7:25 ("I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment"). The *Spiritual Diary* validates these textual admissions not merely as humility, but as ontological facts of his inspiration; his writings originate from his *proprium* (selfhood), not from the direct dictation of the Divine Human.

### **2.2 The Permissive Function of the Epistles**

If Paul’s writings lack the internal sense, their inclusion in the canon requires explanation. The *Spiritual Diary* posits a protective, permissive function for these texts. Entry 4824 explains that the Epistles are "permitted that they may be in the Church, lest those who are of the Church should work evil to the Word of the Lord".1 This implies that the Epistles serve as a "court of the Gentiles"—an outer layer of doctrine for those incapable of bearing the intense heat and light of the internal sense of the Gospels.

The text argues that if men of evil life—specifically those motivated by the love of dominion or the love of the world—were to engage directly with the internal sense of the Word, they would profane it, leading to inevitable spiritual destruction. Paul’s theology, structured around forensic logic and dialectic rather than correspondence, engages the rational mind without necessarily opening the internal man. Thus, the Church "explains the Word of the Lord, but by means of the Epistles of Paul," effectively using Paul as a shield against the direct, searing demands of the Gospel imperative of charity.1

### **2.3 Paul’s Spiritual State and Motivation**

The source of Paul’s inspiration is inextricably linked to his spiritual state. Entry 4561m provides a forensic psychological profile of the apostle in the spiritual world: "Paul, while he was alive, thought, respecting the other life, only in a worldly manner... He supposed there would be worldly glory there." This worldly ambition is identified as the driving force behind his theological innovations. The desire to be the "greatest" and to "introduce all into heaven" on his own account 1 stands in direct contradiction to the Lord’s teaching in Matthew 23:11-12 regarding humility.

The report notes that Paul "rejects the interiors of the Word, because they are opposed to worldly glory, and opposed to merit".1 The internal sense of the Word requires the total negation of self-merit and the acknowledgment that all good flows from the Lord. Paul’s theology, which often centers on his own labor ("I laboured more abundantly than they all," 1 Cor 15:10) and his unique stewardship of the "mystery," is interpreted in the Diary not as divine commission, but as the manifestation of a spiritual ambition to usurp the Lord’s role as the door to the sheepfold.

### **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Inspiration Sources**

| Feature | The Word (Gospels/Prophets) | The Pauline Epistles | Source in S\_D |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Origin** | Divine Dictation | Self-Derived Intelligence |  |
| **Structure** | Contains Internal Sense (Correspondence) | No Internal Sense; Doctrinal | , |
| **Angelic Perception** | Every tittle perceived in 3rd Heaven | Not perceived via correspondence | , |
| **Author's State** | Instrument of the Divine | Seeking Worldly Glory/Merit | \[4561m\] |
| **Function** | Connection with Heaven | Protective/Permissive Buffer |  |

## **3\. Inter-Apostolic Conflict: The Spiritual Geopolitics of Peter and Paul**

The New Testament records tension between Paul and the Jerusalem apostles, notably in Galatians 2 where Paul withstands Peter to his face. Traditional exegesis views this as a dialectical moment in the clarification of the Gospel. However, the *Spiritual Diary* reveals this conflict to be a manifestation of deep-seated spiritual antagonism regarding the "Keys of the Kingdom."

### **3.1 The Usurpation of the Keys**

Entry 4631m offers a startling insight into Paul’s attitude toward Peter in the spiritual world: "Paul has an utter aversion to Peter, and says that he \[Peter\] understands nothing, and so has no power." This aversion is not merely intellectual but functional. Paul’s ambition was to be the "introducer" into heaven. Swedenborg records Paul stating: "he wanted to steal this \[the keys\] away from him \[Peter\], and appropriate it to himself, because he had laboured more".1

This spiritual datum illuminates the textual insistence in Paul’s letters on his independence from the Jerusalem pillar apostles (Galatians 1:11-17). The "keys" given to Peter (Matthew 16:19) correspond spiritually to the *truth of faith* derived from the good of charity—the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divinity. By claiming to have "labored more," Paul attempts to substitute *personal merit* and *doctrinal sophistication* for the simple, rock-like confession of the Lord represented by Peter. The *Spiritual Diary* suggests that the historical shift of the Church from Petrine authority (confession of Christ) to Pauline authority (justification dogma) was a reflection of this spiritual usurpation.

### **3.2 The Formation of an "Infernal Heaven"**

The conflict with the apostolic college drove Paul, according to the Diary, into diverse and dangerous associations. Entry 4561m notes that Paul "associated himself, on several occasions, with evil spirits and devils, in order that he might make for himself an altogether infernal heaven." This "heaven" refers to a society of spirits organized around a specific leader or doctrine.

Paul’s theological system, by loosening the bonds of the law and emphasizing forensic grace, provided a rallying point for spirits who desired salvation without the purification of the will. This aligns with the description of "Babel" in the Diary, where religious doctrine is used as a means for dominion.1 Paul’s rejection of the "interiors of the Word" allowed him to construct a spiritual fiefdom where his authority was paramount, mirroring the "faith alone" cities described in entry 4699 which eventually sink into the hells.

## **4\. Soteriological Divergence: The 'Dragon' of Faith Alone**

The most extensive theological critique in the *Spiritual Diary* concerns the doctrine of Sola Fide ("Faith Alone"). Swedenborg traces the corruption of the Christian Church to the separation of Faith (Truth) from Charity (Good), a separation canonically rooted in the Pauline antithesis between Law and Grace.

### **4.1 The Metaphysics of Faith and Charity**

Swedenborg posits a spiritual axiom in entry 4626m: "Faith, however, without charity, is not given." The report details that faith is the form of the will’s love. If the will is not regenerated through charity (good works, justice, equity), the intellectual form of faith is empty and dead.

The *Spiritual Diary* provides a critique of the Pauline/Lutheran definition of faith as "confidence" or trust in the merit of Christ. Entry 4785 notes that the Moravians (Zinzendorfians), who represent the crystallization of Pauline theology, define faith as "confidence (förtroende) in Him... as towards a man." This reliance on vicarious merit, coupled with the rejection of works, creates a spiritual state where the believer remains in the love of self while claiming the holiness of Christ.

This validates the Epistle of James (2:20, "faith without works is dead") against the Pauline formulation in Romans 3:28. The *Spiritual Diary* essentially canonizes James’s view as spiritual physics: "Faith without charity is the thinking of a thing: but charity is the willing of a thing... consequently, faith is the form of the will".1 Without the substance of charity, the form of faith dissipates in the other life.

### **4.2 The "Dragon" and the Torture of the Word**

The entities described as the "Dragon" in the Apocalypse (Rev 12\) are identified in the *Spiritual Diary* as those who confirm themselves in "Faith Alone" using the literal sense of the Word. Entry 4760 states: "They are those who reason about divine truth from sciences... and, for confirmation, take the literal sense of the Word, which they torture into agreement."

The "torture" of the text refers to the exegetical gymnastics required to subordinate the clear ethical imperatives of the Gospels (e.g., the Sermon on the Mount, the Sheep and the Goats) to the Pauline doctrine of justification. Entry 5090 notes that these spirits are dangerous because they can "persuade almost any of the simple and the upright... merely from the external sense of the Word." This validates the danger of Pauline literalism; by elevating snippets of the Epistles above the holistic life-teachings of the Word, the "Dragon" spirits destroy the conscience of the Church.

### **4.3 Luther’s Spiritual Fate and the Hell of Contentions**

Martin Luther serves as the primary case study for the spiritual consequences of Pauline soteriology. Entry 5103 describes Luther in the spiritual world not as a reformer of abuses, but as a "quarreller" who excites "tumults" and "infestations." His dominant love is identified as the love of his own doctrine and the desire to rule thereby.

"He is of such a character that he wishes all others to believe what he says... Nor does he suffer others to believe and speak differently from him, always saying that the things he said were truths themselves".1

Luther’s placement "under the soles of both feet" 1 corresponds to the sensual-natural state. The doctrine of Faith Alone, by focusing on the external imputation of righteousness, leaves the internal man unregenerate. Consequently, Luther and his followers are depicted as remaining in the pride of self-intelligence, engaging in perpetual theological combat ("tearings of garments") rather than entering the peace of celestial charity.

### **4.4 The Moravian Heresy: The Antinomian Endpoint**

The Moravians are highlighted as the ultimate expression of the "Faith Alone" error. Entry 4791 notes that they "believe that good work, and a life of good in general, effect nothing, but only faith... they also explain away all those places in the New Testament where good works are treated of."

This leads to a practical antinomianism where adultery, theft, and deceit are tolerated because the believer is "in the Lord" via faith.1 Entry 4816 records their blasphemous assertion that "when the Lord spoke concerning love, and doing good... the Lord spoke insanely." This rejection of the Lord’s teaching in favor of a soteriological formula derived from Paul demonstrates the total inversion of order: the servant (Paul) is made judge over the Master (Jesus).

| Model | Pauline/Protestant (as critiqued) | Swedenborgian/Gospel (validated) | S\_D Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Justification** | Forensic imputation of Christ's merit | Impartation of good via regeneration | \[4639m\], |
| **Role of Works** | Fruits/Evidence (not saving) | Essential container of spiritual life | \[4626m\], \[4776m\] |
| **Definition of Faith** | Confidence/Trust in Merit | Form of Charity/Will | , |
| **Spiritual Outcome** | Vastation/Loss of Truth | Conjunction with Heaven | , |

## **5\. Christology: The Divine Human and the Correction of Subordinationism**

The Christological conflict between Swedenborg and the Pauline tradition centers on the nature of the Lord’s Humanity and His relationship to the Father. Paul’s theology, particularly the distinction between God and the "Mediator" (1 Tim 2:5) and the subjection of the Son (1 Cor 15:28), acts as the seedbed for subordinationism.

### **5.1 The Divine Human as the All of Heaven**

The *Spiritual Diary* asserts that the "Divine Human" is the fundamental theological reality of heaven. Entry 4844 states: "Every man whatever, who has not destroyed his rational mind... has the idea of a human concerning the Divine... This Divine Human is nowhere else than in the Lord."

Swedenborg argues that the Lord’s Human is not a separate nature (as in Chalcedonian orthodoxy influenced by Paul) but is the visible manifestation of the Father. Entry 4847 explains: "The Divine Itself, which is the first essence... the second essence is Man born... and the third essence... is Man proceeding." This Trinitarian Monotheism rejects the idea of three persons or two distinct natures that can be separated. The Lord *is* the Father made visible.

### **5.2 The Council of Nicaea and the "Dark Chamber"**

The separation of the Divine and Human natures, a theological development reliant on Pauline distinctions, is attributed in the *Spiritual Diary* to a conspiracy for power. Entry 4551 describes a "dark chamber" where a council convened to distinguish between the Lord's Divine and Human. The motivation was political: "if they had acknowledged the Lord as one with the Father... the papal throne would not subsist."

By separating the Human (which they could claim to represent via the Vicar) from the Divine, the hierarchy usurped the Lord’s power. Paul’s language of mediation provided the textual cover for this separation. The Diary contrasts this with the faith of the "simple good" and the "Africans" 1, who readily accept the idea that God appeared as a Man and that the Lord is that One God, without the confusing metaphysics of hypostatic unions and distinct persons.

### **5.3 The Rejection of Vicarious Atonement**

The Pauline doctrine of atonement—that Christ suffered to satisfy the Father’s justice—is implicitly rejected by the assertion that the Father and Son are one. Entry 4723 connects the "insanity of the evil" (who believe themselves gods) to the rejection of the Lord’s full Divinity. If the Lord is merely a man who was "accepted" by the Father (as the Moravians claimed, citing Paul ), then He is not the Omnipotent God. The *Spiritual Diary* insists that the Lord glorified His Human by His own power, uniting it to the Divine Love within Him, thereby bridging the gap between the infinite and the finite.1

## **6\. Eschatological Consequences: The Last Judgment on the Church of Faith Alone**

The *Spiritual Diary* describes the Last Judgment (1757) as a spiritual event executed primarily upon the "Reformed" (Protestants) and "Babylon" (Catholics). This judgment serves as the final forensic validation of Swedenborg’s critique of Paul.

### **6.1 The Destruction of the Faith Alone Cities**

Entry 4699 describes the spiritual geography of the "Faith Alone" believers. They inhabit cities situated "forward, to the right, in the plane of the sole of the foot." This location indicates a state that is sensual and external. The inhabitants include those who lived morally for the sake of reputation (not religion) and those who were openly evil but relied on doctrine for salvation.

When the Last Judgment occurred, these cities were "cast down" and "dispersed".1 Entry 5228 specifies that those cast out from the rocks and mountains were "those of the Christian religion who are in faith alone, and have thought nothing about life." This destruction is the empirical proof in the spiritual world that the theological structure built on the Pauline Epistles (as interpreted by the Reformers) is structurally unsound and cannot withstand the influx of Divine Truth.

### **6.2 The Preservation of the "First Resurrection"**

In contrast to the destruction of the Pauline "Dragon," the Diary describes the preservation of those who are of the "First Resurrection." Entry 5389-5390 identifies these as Christians hidden and guarded by the Lord from the primitive times of the Church. These spirits, who acknowledged the Lord and lived in charity, represent the pre-Pauline or non-Pauline stream of Christianity—the simple faithful who held to the Gospels rather than the complex dogmas of justification.

### **6.3 The Geopolitics of Salvation**

The report offers a striking geopolitical analysis of spiritual receptivity. The "Africans" are described in entries 4779 and 5518 as being the most receptive to the heavenly doctrine because they think interiorly and acknowledge God as a Man. In contrast, the Europeans (Christendom) are described as "sensual" and "in ultimates" 1, having closed their interiors through the confirmation of false doctrines (Faith Alone, Tripersonalism) derived from a distorted reading of the Word. This suggests that the future of the true Christian Church (the New Jerusalem) lies outside the traditional boundaries of Pauline Christendom.

## **7\. Conclusion**

The forensic analysis of Emanuel Swedenborg’s *Spiritual Diary* yields a verdict that destabilizes the traditional hierarchy of the New Testament. Through the lens of these spiritual experiences, the Apostle Paul appears not as the supreme architect of Christian theology, but as a "self-derived" intelligence whose writings, while permitted for a time, lack the internal connection to the Divine found in the Gospels.

The evidence points to a three-fold failure in the Pauline legacy as observed in the spiritual world:

1. **Authority:** The substitution of apostolic opinion for Divine Dictation.1  
2. **Soteriology:** The separation of Faith from Charity, creating a "Dragon" that devours the life of the Church.1  
3. **Ecclesiology:** The usurpation of the keys of truth (Peter) by the ambition for glory (Paul), leading to a church built on doctrine rather than life.1

The *Spiritual Diary* thus serves as a corrective revelation, intending to restore the primacy of the "Divine Human" and the Gospel life of Charity, signaling the end of the "Pauline" era of the Church and the inauguration of a new dispensation centered on the immediate presence of the Lord in His Word.
