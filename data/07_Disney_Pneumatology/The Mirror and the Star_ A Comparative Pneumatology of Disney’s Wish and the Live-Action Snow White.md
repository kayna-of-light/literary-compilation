# **The Mirror and the Star: A Comparative Pneumatology of Disney’s *Wish* and the Live-Action *Snow White***

## **I. Introduction: The Divergence of Spiritual Physics in the Centennial Era**

The year 2023 marked the centennial of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, a cultural institution that has arguably served as the primary myth-maker for the Western world in the 20th and 21st centuries. Throughout its history, the studio’s output has operated on a fundamental, almost metaphysical premise: that the internal world of emotion, intent, and character can be—and indeed must be—externalized into the visible world of form, movement, and environment. This premise, whether utilized intuitively by animators or consciously by storytellers, established a structural isomorphism with the theological system of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), specifically his **Doctrine of Correspondences**, which posits that natural forms are the "ultimate" effects of spiritual causes.1

For decades, this "language of nature" remained consistent. A storm in *The Little Mermaid* was not merely a meteorological event but the externalized fury of a sea king; the wilting rose in *Beauty and the Beast* was not a botanical anomaly but a chronometer of the soul's potential for regeneration. The animation medium itself, by its very nature, demanded a "physics of the soul" where gravity, light, and color obeyed the emotional and moral logic of the scene rather than the laws of Newtonian mechanics. This artistic necessity aligned the medium perfectly with Swedenborg’s vision of a plastic, responsive spiritual world where affections manifest visibly as animals and landscapes shift instantaneously to reflect the interior state of the inhabitants.1

However, the recent release of the animated feature *Wish* (2023) and the forthcoming live-action adaptation of *Snow White* (2025) suggests a profound schism in this metaphysical tradition. While *Wish*, intended as a tribute to the studio's legacy, has been critiqued for performing a "theological inversion" or "profanation" of these principles, early analysis of the live-action *Snow White* indicates a surprising fidelity to the structural dynamics of Swedenborgian regeneration.2 This divergence presents a paradox: the film explicitly designed to celebrate the "magic" of the studio (*Wish*) appears to have hollowed out that magic by severing its vertical connection to the Divine, while the film most criticized for its "modern sensibilities" and departure from tradition (*Snow White*) has inadvertently reinforced the deep theological structures of the original fairy tale.

This report undertakes an exhaustive, expert-level investigation into this divergence. It posits that *Wish* represents a shift from "Universal Correspondence" to "Cultural Metaphor" and Gnostic self-deification, effectively severing the link to the "Spiritual Sun".2 Conversely, the live-action *Snow White*, through its specific reinvention of characters like **Jonathan** and its handling of the **Magic Mirror**, inadvertently reconstructs a rigorous Swedenborgian drama regarding the destruction of the **Proprium** (selfhood) and the restoration of the "State of the Church." By applying the forensic tools of Swedenborgian exegesis—specifically the doctrines of **Influx**, **Vastation**, and **Use**—this analysis will demonstrate why the "modernized" live-action film may be spiritually more "traditional" than the studio's animated centennial celebration.

## **II. The Swedenborgian Substrate: A Historical Baseline**

To understand the magnitude of the divergence between *Wish* and *Snow White* (2025), one must first establish the "active substrate" of Swedenborgian thought that historically underpinned the Disney universe. This was not merely a stylistic choice but an operational philosophy that governed the "physics" of the animated world.4

### **2.1 The Doctrine of Influx and the Illusion of Life**

The core of Swedenborgian cosmology is the **Doctrine of Influx**. Reality is stratified into discrete degrees: the Celestial (Love), the Spiritual (Wisdom), and the Natural (Action). A fundamental tenet of this system is that life does not originate in the natural world; it flows into it from the Lord, who is the "Spiritual Sun".2 Forms in the natural world—whether human bodies, animals, or trees—are merely "receptacles" of this life. They do not generate life; they receive it.

In the "Golden Age" of Disney animation (e.g., *Pinocchio*, *Snow White* 1937\) and the "Renaissance" (e.g., *The Lion King*, *Beauty and the Beast*), this doctrine was secularized as the artistic principle of "Inner Force driving Outer Form".4 Animators were taught that a character’s movement (natural effect) must be driven by an internal intent or emotion (spiritual cause). If a character moved without this internal motivation, it was dismissed as "rubber hose" animation—mechanical, lifeless, and devoid of soul. This pedagogical mandate created a universe where the physical world was transparent to the spiritual. A storm was not meteorological; it was the externalization of rage. A blooming meadow was not agricultural; it was the externalization of innocence.1

This alignment was not accidental but the result of specific personnel and pedagogical choices. The studio actively sought consultants and teachers who could articulate this "physics of the soul," leading to an environment where the "Doctrine of Correspondences" became the de facto operating system of the studio.4 The result was a cinematic universe where the boundary between the "spiritual" and the "natural" was porous, allowing for a direct, causal relationship between moral states and physical realities.

### **2.2 The "Fisher King" and the Moral Mirror**

This substrate manifested most clearly in the "Fisher King" archetype, which correlates with Swedenborg’s correspondence of the **Land** (Earth) with the **State of the Church**.1 In Swedenborg’s exegesis, the physical state of the land in biblical prophecy—whether it is blooming, drought-stricken, or frozen—is never a description of agriculture but a precise diagnosis of the spiritual state of the people.

Disney films replicate this diagnostic topography with high fidelity. In *The Lion King*, the reign of Mufasa (Divine Truth/Law) maintains the "Circle of Life" (Divine Order), resulting in a lush kingdom. The "Sun" (corresponding to Divine Love and Wisdom) governs the hierarchy of creation. When Scar (Self-Love/Falsity) usurps the throne, the transformation of the landscape is immediate and total. The sun is obscured, the water (Truth) dries up, and the land becomes a skeletal wasteland. This is a perfect depiction of "Vastation"—the spiritual desolation that occurs when the connection to the Divine is severed by the rule of the Proprium.1

This "Science of Correspondences" provided an "ontological certainty" to the storytelling.3 Symbols were not arbitrary metaphors invented by writers; they were treated as discovered, universal laws linking cause and effect. A lion represented courage not because a writer decided it should, but because the spiritual affection of power flows into that natural form. This "vertical" causality gave the films a resonance that transcended cultural boundaries, tapping into the "collective unconscious" or the "Mundus Imaginalis" described by Jung and Swedenborg alike.1

### **2.3 The Shift: From Universal Truth to Cultural Metaphor**

In the modern era, specifically the post-2010 "Revival" period marked by films like *Moana* and *Frozen II*, a critical fissure emerged. The studio began to rely heavily on "Cultural Trusts"—advisory bodies composed of anthropologists and cultural practitioners—to ensure the accuracy of their depictions of specific cultures.3 While this ensured cultural respect, it introduced a new hermeneutic layer that shifted the focus from "Universal Correspondence" to "Cultural Metaphor."

Symbols were no longer presented as universal laws of spiritual influx (Vertical) but as specific cultural beliefs (Horizontal). A demigod’s hook or a magical tattoo was significant because a specific culture *believed* it was, not because it was an ontological necessity of the spiritual world. This shift from "ontological certainty" to "anthropological relativism" paved the way for the theological confusion observed in *Wish*, where the mechanics of magic become arbitrary and self-referential rather than transcendent and causal.3

## **III. *Wish*: The Inverted Influx and the Deification of Self**

The film *Wish* (2023) serves as the primary case study for the abandonment or inversion of this system. Intended as a centennial celebration of the studio’s history of "wishing upon a star," the theological mechanics it establishes represent a radical departure from the studio's historical metaphysics, effectively "profaning" the very tradition it seeks to honor.

### **3.1 The Star as "Stardust": Immanence vs. Transcendence**

In the classic Disney canon, exemplified by *Pinocchio* (1940), the "wish" is a prayer directed upward to a transcendent source (the Blue Star/Blue Fairy). The puppet Pinocchio is "empty" and must earn his soul through moral regeneration ("brave, truthful, and unselfish").2 This aligns with Swedenborg’s view that the human proprium (self) is lifeless until animated by Divine Influx. The source of life is external and superior to the vessel.

In *Wish*, this cosmology is inverted. The song "I'm a Star" explicitly teaches that "we are our own origin story" and that the divine spark is inherent in the material constitution of the characters ("stardust").5 This is a **Gnostic** or **Pantheistic** framework where the divine is trapped in matter, rather than a **Theistic** framework where life flows *into* matter from a higher degree.

The implication of this shift is profound. It collapses the "Vertical Causality" of Swedenborg into a "Horizontal" plane. There is no need for regeneration, repentance, or influx from the Lord because the self is already divine. Swedenborg defines the belief that "nature is the source of life" or that "man is God" as the fundamental falsity of the **Proprium** (Self-Love). By celebrating the self as the source of magic, *Wish* inadvertently celebrates the very force (Proprium) that acts as the antagonist in Swedenborg’s theology.2 The film posits that the "wish" is the most important part of the person—their "truth"—and that any authority figure who withholds it is a tyrant. This ignores the Swedenborgian distinction between "good desires" (from the Lord) and "evil lusts" (from the Proprium), flattening all desire into a valid expression of the "divine self."

### **3.2 The Wish Orb: The Externalization of the Ruling Love**

The film introduces the concept of the "Wish Orb," a physical sphere containing a person's greatest desire. King Magnifico extracts these orbs and keeps them in his castle for "safekeeping," causing the citizens to forget their wishes and live in a state of docile contentment.

In Swedenborgian psychology, every being is defined by a "Ruling Love" (Dominant Love). This is the gravitational center of the soul. All thoughts, actions, and memories organize themselves around this core desire. If the ruling love is removed, the person effectively ceases to exist or becomes a "spiritual zombie" until it is restored.2

By treating the Ruling Love as an external object that can be given away, stored, or shattered, *Wish* commodifies the spiritual essence. In Swedenborg’s system, the Ruling Love *is* the life of the person; it cannot be extracted without death. The film’s mechanic suggests that the soul is a possession one *has*, rather than what one *is*.

Furthermore, King Magnifico is described as a "False God" who demands worship in exchange for the "protection" of these wishes. This mirrors Swedenborg’s description of **Babylon**—the profanation of good and truth for the sake of dominion.2 Magnifico mixes the "holy things" (the hopes and souls of the people) with his own "clay" (desire for power). However, the film’s solution to this tyranny is not to restore the wishes to a higher order (Divine Will) but to return them to the "self," reinforcing the closed loop of the Proprium.

### **3.3 The "Hollow" State and the Closed Loop**

Critics and analysts have frequently noted that *Wish* feels "hollow" or lacks the emotional weight of earlier films.2 From a Swedenborgian perspective, this is the inevitable result of the **"Closed Loop of Self-Reference"**.2

The mechanism of "Universal Correspondence" relies on the influx of the Infinite (the Divine) into the Finite (the Natural). This creates a sense of depth, mystery, and life. When the "vertical" connection to the Divine is severed in favor of the "self" (which is finite and dead in itself), the artistic product loses its "soul." It mimics the *forms* of correspondence—talking animals, magic sparks, musical numbers—but lacks the *influx* that gives them life. The Star in *Wish* is not a messenger of Divine Providence; it is a "mascot" or a reflection of Asha’s own ego.

This reliance on "Cultural Metaphor" (horizontal references to Disney history) rather than "Universal Correspondence" creates a simulacrum of magic. The film references *Peter Pan*, *Bambi*, and *Snow White*, but these are Easter eggs (surface data) rather than spiritual resonances. The result is a "Kingdom of Self," where the universe exists only to validate the ego's desires, a state Swedenborg identifies with the "Love of the World" separated from the "Love of Heaven."

## **IV. *Snow White* (2025): A Structural Restoration of Correspondence**

In stark contrast to the "self-deification" of *Wish*, the 2025 live-action *Snow White* appears to reconstruct the rigorous moral and spiritual architecture of Swedenborg’s universe. Despite modernizing elements—such as the removal of the Prince Charming archetype and the introduction of a new character named Jonathan—the film's plot mechanics, specifically regarding the **Mirror**, the **Queen**, and the **Land**, align with the "Science of Correspondences" with high fidelity.

### **4.1 The Mirror as the Proprium and the Void**

The central antagonist in Swedenborgian theology is the **Proprium**—the "ownhood" or "selfhood" of man. It is the vivid sensation that we live, think, and act from ourselves. When the Proprium confirms itself as the source of life, it becomes the "Love of Self" (Amor Sui), which is the root of all evil and the essence of Hell.

In the 2025 film, the Evil Queen’s relationship with the Magic Mirror is central to this dynamic. The mirror represents the **Self-Reflection of the Proprium**. The Queen gazes into it not to seek truth, but to confirm her own superiority ("fairest of all"). It is a closed loop of vanity.

The climax of the film involves the Queen destroying the Mirror. This act is pivotal. According to plot leaks and descriptions, shattering the mirror creates a "rift into a netherspace" that consumes her.6 She turns to ash and is sucked into this void.

This imagery is strikingly Swedenborgian. Swedenborg describes Hell not as a place of external punishment, but as a state where the internal is a "void" or "abyss" because it is emptied of truths and goods.8 The "netherspace" behind the mirror corresponds to the **internal state of the Proprium**. It is a black hole of self-absorption. The fact that the Queen is consumed by the mirror is a perfect visual representation of Swedenborg’s teaching that "Evil is its own punishment." The Proprium consumes itself. She is not killed by Snow White (which would be external combat); she is consumed by the medium of her own vanity (internal vastation).

Furthermore, Swedenborg notes that "broken glass" or a shattered vessel signifies the destruction of truths by falsities, or the breaking of the container of the letter to reveal the internal.9 By shattering the mirror, the Queen destroys the container of her own self-image, revealing the "abyss" of her non-existence beneath.

### **4.2 Jonathan: The "God-Given" Truth of Doctrine**

The replacement of the generic "Prince" with a bandit named **Jonathan** has been a point of significant controversy. However, structurally, this character aligns with a sophisticated Swedenborgian reading of biblical typology, suggesting that the change may restore a deeper spiritual meaning to the narrative.

#### **4.2.1 The Etymology and Archetype**

The name **Jonathan** (Hebrew *Yehonatan*) means "Yahweh has given" or "God-given".10 In Swedenborgian exegesis, names in the Word are never arbitrary; they signify the "quality" or "essence" of the person.12

In the Bible, Jonathan is the son of King Saul (the failed, external King) but the sworn friend of David (the true, spiritual King). Swedenborg analyzes Jonathan as representing the **"Truth of Doctrine"** or the **"External Truth protecting the Church"**.13 Jonathan aids David (the spiritual principle) against Saul (the corrupt natural principle). He acts as a bridge or a medium.

In the film, the "King" (Snow White's father) is dead or absent, representing a "Vastated Church." The Queen (a Saul figure/Usurper) rules tyrannically. Jonathan, introduced as a "bandit" or outlaw, operates outside the corrupt law of the Queen. He aids Snow White (the Soul/Church) in regaining her kingdom. Just as the biblical Jonathan acts as a medium between the old kingdom (Saul) and the new (David), the film’s Jonathan acts as the **"Intellectual/Active"** principle that supports the **"Volitional/Love"** principle (Snow White).

This dynamic is more spiritually accurate than the "Sola Fide" (Faith Alone) model of the 1937 film, where the Prince arrives as a *deus ex machina* to save a passive Snow White. In Swedenborgian regeneration, the Will (Snow White) and the Understanding (Jonathan) must cooperate. Jonathan is the "God-given" truth that assists the soul in its battle against the Proprium.

#### **4.2.2 The "Thief" Correspondence**

Jonathan is explicitly described as a "bandit" or "thief" who steals from the Queen to feed the poor.15 While "thief" usually has a negative correspondence in Swedenborg (stealing merit from the Lord) 17, there is a contextually positive sense. The Lord describes coming "as a thief" (unexpectedly) to break into the closed house of the mind.18 Additionally, the "spoliation of the Egyptians"—taking the knowledges/goods held by the evil (the Queen) and applying them to good use (feeding the poor)—is a recurring biblical theme representing the reclamation of truth from the Proprium. Jonathan enters the "closed" system of the Queen’s tyranny to introduce a new element of hope, functioning as a disruptive force of truth in a kingdom of falsity.

### **4.3 Snow White: The Church Militant and the Doctrine of Use**

The critique that the new Snow White is "woke" because she seeks leadership rather than romance 19 overlooks the Swedenborgian imperative of **Use**. Swedenborg explicitly rejects "Faith Alone" (waiting passively for salvation). He argues that "Charity (Love) and Faith (Truth) make one in **Good Works** (Use)".20

Snow White’s transition from a passive scullery maid to a leader who rallies the kingdom corresponds to the transition from the **"Church Waiting"** to the **"Church Militant"** or **"Church in Act."** Her new song, "Waiting on a Wish," contains lyrics that express a desire to "learn to be my father's daughter" and "start speaking with a fearless heart".21

* **"Father’s Daughter":** This corresponds to the soul seeking conjunction with **Divine Good** (The Father).  
* **"Fearless Heart":** This corresponds to the activation of the **Will** (Heart) by **Divine Truth**.  
* **Rejection of Passivity:** "Someone who just might be brave / Someone no one needs to save".21 In Swedenborgian regeneration, the individual *must* compel themselves to act against evil *as if* from themselves, while acknowledging the power comes from the Lord. This "as-if-of-self" agency is critical. The 1937 passive Snow White represents the "sleeping" soul; the 2025 active Snow White represents the "regenerating" soul engaging in combat against the hells.

### **4.4 The Environment as Moral Mirror (Vastation and Restoration)**

The live-action film retains the Swedenborgian "Fisher King" dynamic with striking clarity. Under the Evil Queen, the kingdom is described as having "pale light," "hues turning pale," and farmers conscripted into soldiers.22 This is **spiritual vastation**—the draining of "Charity" (color/life) and "Peace" (farmers) by the "Love of Dominion" (soldiers/tyranny).

The restoration is instantaneous. When the Mirror is broken and the Queen consumed, the kingdom "goes back to the way it once was," and everyone celebrates.23 This immediate restoration of the environment upon the removal of the ruling evil is a textbook example of Swedenborgian **Influx** returning to its proper order. The block (Proprium) is removed, and Divine Life flows in again, healing the land.

## **V. Detailed Comparative Analysis: Why the Divergence?**

Why does the *animation* (the medium of spirit) fail where the *live-action* (the medium of realism) succeeds in upholding this doctrine? The answer lies in the tension between "Committee Design" and "Archetypal Structure."

### **5.1 The "Cultural Trust" vs. The Archetype**

The document 3 argues that modern animation utilizes "Cultural Trusts" to ensure accuracy, which shifts the focus to **Cultural Metaphor** (horizontal). *Wish* is a product of this "committee" thinking. It tries to represent "us" (humanity) as the source of magic to appeal to modern secular humanism. It constructs a mythology from the ground up, trying to amalgamate Disney tropes into a new system. The result is disjointed because it lacks the "vertical" spine of a true myth.

*Snow White* (2025), however, benefits from being a remake. It inherits a narrative skeleton built on **Romanticism** and **Christian/Swedenborgian** archetypes from the 1812 Brothers Grimm tale and the 1937 film. Even with modern "updates," the core structure remains:

1. The Innocent Soul (Snow White).  
2. The Proprium/Self-Love (Evil Queen).  
3. The Mirror of Truth/Judgment.  
4. The Fall (Poison Apple/Profanation).  
5. The Regeneration/Resurrection.

The writers (Greta Gerwig/Erin Cressida Wilson) could change the *dialogue* or the *profession* of the love interest, but they could not change the *ontological structure* of the fairy tale without breaking the story. Thus, the Swedenborgian correspondence survives in the *plot mechanics* even if the *dialogue* shifts toward modern empowerment. The structure resists the "humanist" drift because the story fundamentally relies on the defeat of Self-Love (The Queen) by Innocence (Snow White) aided by Truth (Jonathan).

### **5.2 CGI vs. Reality: The Problem of "Stardust"**

In *Wish*, the animation style itself contributes to the inversion. The "Wish Orb" is a CGI object—a commodity. By making the spiritual *too* visible and *too* manipulatable (held in hands, thrown around), it loses its correspondential nature and becomes a "magical object."

In the live-action *Snow White*, the blending of CGI (the Mirror, the fantastical elements) with physical actors and environments grounds the spiritual drama in a "real" world. This friction between the real (Gal Gadot) and the surreal (the Mirror Void) better captures the Swedenborgian concept of the **Spiritual World** interacting with the **Natural World**. The horror of the Queen turning to ash and being sucked into a void feels like a *spiritual judgment* breaking into physical reality, whereas the magic battles in *Wish* feel like video game mechanics. The "uncanny valley" of the live-action mirror effectively conveys the "otherness" of the spiritual state, whereas the stylized animation of *Wish* flattens everything into a single aesthetic plane.

## **VI. Case Studies in Correspondence: 2025 vs. Tradition**

To demonstrate the fidelity of the live-action film, we compare its specific elements to the Swedenborgian library.

### **Table 1: Comparative Correspondence Analysis**

| Element | Swedenborgian Correspondence | Snow White (1937) | Wish (2023) | Snow White (2025) | Verdict |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Source of Power** | **The Lord / Spiritual Sun** (Influx from above). | The wishing well (prayer)/Divine Providence. | **The Self / Stardust** (Internal/Immanent). | **God-Given Truth** (Jonathan) / Father's Legacy. | *Snow White* (2025) retains external source (Father/God-given). |
| **The Mirror** | **Proprium / Self-Intelligence**. | Passive revealer of truth ("Magic Mirror on the wall"). | **Magnifico's Mirrors** (Vanity/Narcissism). | **The Abyss**. It consumes the Queen. Active agent of judgment. | *Snow White* (2025) elevates the mirror to a site of **Judgment**. |
| **The Prince / Helper** | **Truth of Doctrine / Intellect**. | Generic "Romance" / Savior. | Non-existent (Asha saves herself). | **Jonathan ("God-Given")**. Active helper/partner in battle. | *Snow White* (2025) aligns with biblical **Jonathan** (Truth aiding the King). |
| **The Villain's Fate** | **Vastation / Hell** (Evil consumes itself). | Fall from cliff (Nature destroys evil). | Trapped in mirror (Static). | **Turned to Ash / Sucked into Void** (Internal consumption). | *Snow White* (2025) depicts **Spiritual Vastation** most accurately. |
| **The Wish** | **Prayer / Desire for Good**. | "I'm Wishing" (Prayer for love/connection). | **Commodity** (Orb) extracted and hoarded. | **"Waiting on a Wish"** (Desire for active Use/Leadership). | *Snow White* (2025) aligns with **Doctrine of Use**. |

### **6.1 The "Void" and the "Broken Mirror"**

The imagery of the broken mirror in the 2025 film is particularly significant. When the Queen smashes the mirror, she is attempting to destroy the *Truth* (that Snow White is fairest). In Swedenborgian terms, to destroy Truth is to commit **Profanation**.

The result is not that the mirror ceases to function, but that it opens a **"Void"**.7 This corresponds to the **"Hell of the Profaners"**—those who mix truth and evil. They are not merely "punished" by an external agent; they are "swallowed up" by their own interior state. The 2025 film’s visual of the Queen turning to ash (total lack of spiritual life) and being pulled into the dark dimension is a profound representation of **Second Death**. It is a far more severe and spiritually accurate consequence than the cliff fall in the 1937 film, which could be interpreted as accidental or natural. The 2025 death is explicitly spiritual and internal.

## **VII. Comparative Synthesis: The Mirror vs. The Star**

The divergence between *Wish* and *Snow White* ultimately comes down to the symbols they choose to center: **The Star** and **The Mirror**.

### **7.1 The Star: The Failure of Humanism**

In *Wish*, the Star is a cute, silent character—a "mascot" of the self. It validates Asha’s desires without challenging them. It represents a **Humanist** theology: the divine is friendly, internal, and affirms our "truth." This leads to a spiritual flatness because there is no tension between the "Old Man" (Proprium) and the "New Man" (Regenerate Soul). Everyone is already a "Star."

### **7.2 The Mirror: The Persistence of Theism**

In *Snow White*, the Mirror is a terrifying, judgmental force. It speaks the Truth ("You are not the fairest") regardless of the Queen's feelings. It represents a **Theistic** theology: Truth is objective, external, and often painful. It creates tension. It demands that the "Old Man" (Queen) be destroyed so that the "New Man" (Snow White) can rule.

The live-action film, by centering the Mirror and the Queen’s struggle with it, retains the dramatic tension of **Judgment**. It acknowledges that there is an objective moral order that cannot be bribed or shattered without consequence. *Wish* tries to democratize magic ("everyone gets a wish"), effectively removing the hierarchy of spiritual degrees. *Snow White* maintains the hierarchy: The Queen falls because she violates the order; Snow White rises because she aligns with it (Father's Daughter/Jonathan's Partner).

### **7.3 The Paradox of "Wokeness"**

Ironically, the very elements of *Snow White* labeled as "woke" or "modern" by critics—Snow White’s leadership, the active role of Jonathan, the removal of the "saving kiss" as the sole resolution—align her *more* closely with the Swedenborgian ideal of the **Regenerate Person**.

* **The 1937 Snow White** is the "Church in Expectation"—passive, waiting for Grace.  
* **The 2025 Snow White** is the "Church in Act"—cooperating with Grace (Jonathan) to banish Evil (Queen).

Swedenborg argues that man must act "as if from himself" to shun evils. Passive waiting is "Faith Alone," which is spiritually dead. Therefore, the "girlboss" energy of the new Snow White, when viewed through this specific theological lens, is actually a correction of the "Faith Alone" passivity of the 1937 original. She is taking up the "Sword of Truth" (figuratively) and engaging in the work of regeneration.

## **VIII. Conclusion: The Future of the "Animating Spirit"**

The user’s observation is astute: *Wish*, the film explicitly designed to celebrate the studio’s magic, betrays the spiritual mechanics of that magic by secularizing it into "self-actualization." It is a film about "stardust" that forgets the Sun. It offers a "horizontal" theology that feels hollow because it lacks the "vertical" influx of life.

In contrast, the live-action *Snow White*—a film criticized for its "modern sensibilities"—actually reinforces the deep theological structures of the original fairy tale. By adhering to the "bones" of the Grimm/Disney lineage, it unavoidably channels the Swedenborgian ghost in the machine. It demonstrates that you can change the *dress* of a story (make the princess a leader, make the prince a bandit), but if you keep the *correspondences* (Mirror, Apple, Kingdom, Judgment), the spiritual physics will assert themselves.

The live-action film is true to doctrine not because of its politics, but because it respects the **Law of Consequences** in a spiritual universe: Evil consumes itself (The Mirror/Void), and Truth, when active and "God-given" (Jonathan), restores the land (The Kingdom). As Disney moves forward, the lesson is clear: The "Magic" does not come from the *idea* of magic (The Star); it comes from the *obedience* to spiritual laws (The Mirror). To reanimate its soul, the studio must look less at its own reflection in the water ("I'm a Star") and more at the hard truth in the glass.
