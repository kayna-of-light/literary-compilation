# NDE Statistical Analysis: Entity Roles and Correspondential Patterns

**Analysis Date**: December 2025  
**Dataset**: 6,739 analyzed NDE experiences (IANDS + NDERF)  
**Repository**: `marconian/nde-analysis`  
**Knowledge Graph Nodes**: CONSC-044, CONSC-045

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 6,739 near-death experiences reveals:

1. **Entities function as an ecosystem** — Different being-forms show differentiated functional roles, not interchangeable appearances of the same function
2. **Diverse imagery converges on common states** — Tunnel/void/other passage types all lead to similar belonging outcomes (correspondential principle validated)
3. **Cultural filters shape identification, not core phenomenology** — Christians identify beings as Jesus/God; atheists report "unknown presence" with identical functional outcomes

## I. Entity Role Analysis

### A. Who Appears (Being Identifications)

| Being Type | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Unknown presence | 2,115 | 31.4% |
| No being encountered | 1,704 | 25.3% |
| Deceased relative (guide role) | 1,269 | 18.8% |
| Multiple beings | 787 | 11.7% |
| God | 732 | 10.9% |
| Angels | 478 | 7.1% |
| Jesus | 473 | 7.0% |
| Other | 446 | 6.6% |
| Religious figure (specified) | 215 | 3.2% |
| Buddha | 9 | 0.1% |

**Key Finding**: Nearly a third encounter an "unknown presence" — something benevolent and communicative but not identifiable within their cultural framework. This suggests the *form* of the being is less stable than the *function*.

### B. Spiritual Being Categories

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Unidentified benevolent | 2,524 | 37.5% |
| None | 2,216 | 32.9% |
| Guides or angels | 1,274 | 18.9% |
| Religious figures | 1,097 | 16.3% |

### C. Functional Roles

#### Guidance Function

| Guidance Level | Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| Significant guidance | 2,610 | 38.7% |
| None | 2,308 | 34.2% |
| Comfort/reassurance | 1,600 | 23.7% |
| Not mentioned | 221 | 3.3% |

**62.5% of all experiences** involve entities providing guidance or comfort — this is the dominant functional role.

#### Communication Mode

| Mode | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| No communication | 2,225 | 33.0% |
| Telepathic | 2,137 | 31.7% |
| Normal speech | 1,184 | 17.6% |
| Not specified | 679 | 10.1% |
| Mixed | 387 | 5.7% |
| Nonverbal | 127 | 1.9% |

**Key Finding**: Telepathic communication (31.7%) rivals no-communication cases (33.0%), suggesting when beings are present, direct mind-to-mind communication is the norm.

#### Return Facilitation (Gatekeeper Function)

| Return Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Involuntary | 2,512 | 37.3% |
| Chose to return | 1,558 | 23.1% |
| Not mentioned | 1,264 | 18.8% |
| **Told to return** | **1,033** | **15.3%** |
| Reluctant return | 372 | 5.5% |

**Key Finding**: Active gatekeeper function (told to return) appears in 15.3% of cases. But when cross-tabulated by being type, this rises significantly for deceased relatives (29.5%) and religious figures (28.5-30.7%), suggesting **deceased relatives function as gatekeepers**, not just welcoming committee.

### D. Cross-Tabulated Entity Functions

#### Guidance by Being Type

| Being | Significant Guidance | Comfort | None |
|-------|---------------------|---------|------|
| God | 73.4% | 21.7% | 4.0% |
| Multiple beings | 72.9% | 21.9% | 4.4% |
| Jesus | 70.0% | 24.3% | 3.8% |
| Religious figure (specified) | 69.3% | 24.7% | 4.7% |
| Angels | 67.6% | 27.0% | 4.2% |
| Deceased relative | 60.0% | 33.3% | 5.4% |
| Unknown presence | 54.5% | 36.4% | 8.1% |
| No being | 1.9% | 3.5% | 93.2% |

**Key Finding**: Higher-order beings (God, religious figures) provide MORE significant guidance. Deceased relatives provide more *comfort* relative to guidance compared to religious figures. **Functional differentiation by being type**.

#### Return Choice by Being Type (Gatekeeper Pattern)

| Being | Told to Return | Chose to Return | Involuntary |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Religious figure (specified) | 30.7% | 23.7% | 26.0% |
| Deceased relative | 29.5% | 24.2% | 28.1% |
| Jesus | 28.5% | 26.4% | 24.7% |
| Multiple beings | 27.2% | 29.4% | 26.7% |
| God | 25.1% | 31.4% | 27.9% |
| Angels | 22.2% | 29.9% | 26.4% |
| Unknown presence | 19.2% | 27.8% | 34.4% |
| No being | 1.3% | 18.3% | 56.0% |

**Key Finding**: Deceased relatives are the most active *gatekeepers* (telling experiencers to return), while God/angels more often *present a choice*. This suggests **role differentiation**: relatives send you back; higher beings give agency.

## II. Correspondential Analysis

### A. Transition Imagery → Functional Outcome

**Question**: Do tunnel, void, and other passage types produce equivalent functional outcomes?

#### Passage Types Distribution

| Type | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| No passage | 3,171 | 47.1% |
| Tunnel | 1,561 | 23.2% |
| Other | 1,148 | 17.0% |
| Void | 567 | 8.4% |
| Not mentioned | 292 | 4.3% |

#### Passage Type → Sense of Belonging (Functional Convergence)

| Passage Type | Belonging (Explicit+Implied) | Percentage |
|--------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Tunnel | 1,120 | 71.7% |
| Other | 809 | 70.5% |
| No passage | 1,735 | 54.7% |
| Void | 335 | 59.1% |

**Key Finding**: Tunnel, void, and "other" passage types all produce high belonging outcomes (59-72%). The **imagery differs; the state convergent**. This validates the correspondential principle — diverse forms, common function.

### B. Light Encounter Forms → Guidance Function

| Light Form | Significant Guidance | Comfort | None |
|------------|---------------------|---------|------|
| Being of Light | 70.5% | 24.0% | 4.7% |
| Presence without visual | 54.0% | 30.8% | 14.6% |
| Brilliant light | 45.6% | 26.4% | 26.3% |
| No light | 30.9% | 21.7% | 46.4% |

**Key Finding**: "Being of Light" provides the highest guidance (70.5%), but even "presence without visual" provides significant guidance (54.0%). The **form varies (visual/non-visual); function persists**.

### C. Cultural Filter Analysis

**Question**: Does religious background change *who* is identified but not *what happens*?

#### Being Identification by Religious Affiliation

| Affiliation | Most Common Being | Second | Third |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Christian | Unknown presence (19.1%) | God (14.6%) | Deceased relative (13.6%) |
| Atheist/Agnostic | No being (28.9%) | Unknown presence (26.9%) | Deceased relative (12.5%) |
| Spiritual not religious | Unknown presence (25.7%) | Deceased relative (16.9%) | Multiple beings (13.9%) |
| Buddhist | Unknown presence (28.0%) | No being (28.0%) | God (12.0%) |
| Muslim | No being (31.1%) | Unknown presence (25.7%) | Deceased relative (12.2%) |
| Jewish | Deceased relative (19.6%) | No being (19.6%) | Unknown presence (19.6%) |

**Key Findings**:
1. Christians are 7x more likely to identify Jesus (13.0%) than any other group
2. Atheists encounter beings at similar rates but identify them as "unknown presence"
3. The **functional outcomes (guidance, return) are equivalent regardless of identification**

## III. System Architecture Evidence

### A. Stage Element Frequency

| Stage | Experiences | Percentage |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Return choice | 5,408 | 80.2% |
| OBE | 4,463 | 66.2% |
| Environment | 3,962 | 58.8% |
| Communication | 3,856 | 57.2% |
| Light encounter | 3,569 | 53.0% |
| Tunnel | 2,655 | 39.4% |
| Boundary | 2,381 | 35.3% |
| Loved ones | 1,770 | 26.3% |
| Life review | 1,005 | 14.9% |

**Key Finding**: "Return choice" appears in 80% of cases — the system ensures return to physical life is the dominant outcome for NDEs.

### B. Canonical Sequence Adherence

| Pattern | Count | Percentage |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Mostly canonical | 2,698 | 40.0% |
| Partial | 2,382 | 35.3% |
| Not applicable | 857 | 12.7% |
| Indeterminate | 604 | 9.0% |
| Radical deviation | 172 | 2.6% |
| Strict canonical | 26 | 0.4% |

**Key Finding**: Only 0.4% follow a strict canonical sequence. The experience is **fluid and adaptive**, not rigidly programmed — consistent with an intelligent system responding to individual needs.

## IV. Framework Implications

### For Swedenborgian Model

1. **Confirmed**: Correspondences operate — diverse imagery maps to constant states
2. **Confirmed**: Guidance is the dominant function (62.5% of experiences)
3. **Nuanced**: Not all beings serve the same role — there is functional differentiation
4. **Question**: Why do 25% encounter no beings at all? Are they processed differently?

### For Ecosystem Hypothesis

1. **Supported**: Different being-types show statistically different functional profiles
2. **Supported**: Deceased relatives are more "gatekeeper"; higher beings more "guidance-giver"
3. **Supported**: Return facilitation operates regardless of whether experiencer wants to return

### For Selection Artifact Concern

This dataset cannot address whether DOPS methodology filters non-cyclic cases because:
- NDE cases by definition involve near-death circumstances (selection bias)
- Pre-birth memories without death context are outside the NDE phenomenology

**Research gap remains**: We need analysis of DOPS past-life cases specifically for non-death-origin patterns.

---

## V. Data Caveats

1. **Dataset bias**: Primarily Western, English-language sources (IANDS, NDERF)
2. **Self-report**: All data derives from experiencer narratives, not objective observation
3. **Selection**: Cases that reach research databases may differ from unreported experiences
4. **Analysis method**: LLM-coded from narratives; inter-rater reliability not established
