# **The Void and the Vessel: A Theological Critique of Passive Kenosis and the Empty House**

## **Executive Summary**

This research report presents an exhaustive theological and phenomenological investigation into the concept of *kenosis* (self-emptying), contrasting it with a rigorous "Active Influx" model of spiritual regeneration. The inquiry is driven by the hypothesis that certain interpretations of kenosis risk promoting a "Passive Kenosis"—a prerequisite state of vacancy—that creates a spiritual hazard. This hazard is theologically identified as the "Empty House" scenario (Matthew 12:43-45), where a mind swept of evil but void of Divine Love becomes a locus for **profanation**, a state spiritually worse than the initial corruption.  
The analysis examines the theological distinction between *Exinanition* (the unique emptying process of Christ) and human regeneration, triangulating this against the extensive Swedenborgian corpus on the laws of Divine Providence, the nature of the *proprium* (self-hood), and the mechanics of influx. The report validates the core contention: Spiritual emptiness is not a preliminary achievement of the self but a dangerous vacuum. True regeneration is an **active displacement**, where the "Good of Love" flows in through a life of Use (Charity), driving out falsity as a secondary effect. The concept of "Kenosis," if separated from the "Active Life," constitutes a theological trap that invites the "seven spirits" of deeper falsity.

## **Part I: The Theological Mechanics of the Empty House**

To adjudicate the validity of the "Kenosis Trap," we must first establish a forensic exegetical foundation of the primary textual evidence: the parable of the Return of the Unclean Spirit. This narrative is not merely a moral fable but a precise description of spiritual hydrodynamics and the structural laws of the human mind.

### **1.1 The Exegesis of Matthew 12:43-45: The Correspondential Anatomy of the Void**

The biblical text serves as the master-key for understanding the peril of passive emptying: *"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order"*.

#### **1.1.1 The Identity of the House: The Mind as Container**

In the rigorous symbol system of the relevant theological documents (the "Science of Correspondences"), the "house" corresponds to the human mind, specifically the interior will and understanding where a person "dwells" in their ruling love. The house is the container of the human essence. It is not a neutral space; it is a vessel designed to be inhabited. The text specifies that the house is the *former* dwelling of the unclean spirit, indicating a mind previously habituated to evils or falsities. The mind, or "house," is arranged into compartments—the rational, the natural, and the sensual—each capable of housing specific affections.

#### **1.1.2 The "Swept and Garnished" Paradox**

The critical adjective cluster—"empty, swept, and put in order" (or garnished)—presents a semantic trap for the uninitiated reader. In a secular or purely moralistic context, a swept and ordered house is a positive image of cleanliness and discipline. However, in the spiritual hermeneutics utilized by Swedenborgian analysis, these terms denote a catastrophic spiritual deficiency. They describe the anatomy of a spiritual vacuum:

* **Empty:** This is the most critical diagnostic term. It signifies a state void of *Good* (Divine Love/Charity). The house is not "empty" of furniture or thoughts; it is empty of the *substance* of life, which is Love. In the spiritual world, there is no such thing as a true vacuum; a space is always filled with an atmosphere. To be "empty" in this context means to be void of the *acknowledged* presence of the Lord. It is a vacuum of the Will. It represents a state where the person has removed the *activities* of sin but has not filled the will with the *affections* of service.  
* **Swept:** Sweeping is the removal of dirt. In correspondence, "dirt" or "dust" signifies evil, specifically the evil of merit and self-love. Therefore, a "swept" house represents a mind where evils have been removed *externally* or visibly. This sweeping can be achieved through various means: fear of the law, fear of reputation, moral self-discipline, or even ascetic practices. However, if the house remains "empty" (void of love) after sweeping, it implies a superficial reformation—the removal of the *appearance* of evil without the implantation of the *love* of good. The "sweeping" has been performed by the self, for the self's sake, rather than by the Lord.  
* **Put in Order (Garnished):** This corresponds to the presence of *Truths* or falsities that mimic truths. The mind is equipped with doctrines, knowledge, and intellectual concepts (the "garnishing"). A "garnished" house is one that is intellectually structured; the person knows the laws of faith, understands theology, and perhaps can even teach it. But these truths are dead because there is no "Master of the House" (Love) to animate them. It represents the **"intellectual proprium"**—a mind structured by theology or philosophy but hollowed of charity.

The "empty house," therefore, describes the precise state of **Passive Kenosis**: a person who has successfully purged their external behaviors (swept) and structured their intellect (put in order) but has failed to admit the inflow of Divine Love through an active life of service. They have created a void where the Divine should be.

### **1.2 The Seven Spirits and the Mechanism of Profanation**

The narrative concludes with a terrifying spiritual consequence: the returning spirit *"brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and settle down there. As a result, that man's last condition is worse than the first"*.

#### **1.2.1 The Meaning of "Seven": Saturation of Evil**

In correspondence, numbers are qualitative, not merely quantitative. The number **seven** signifies "fullness," "completeness," or "holiness" in a good sense (as in the Sabbath). However, in the opposite sense—as applied here to evil spirits—it signifies the *total* profanation of all goods and truths. It represents a saturation point where the mind is completely possessed by the inversion of order. It indicates that the relapse is not merely a return to the old bad habit; it is a systemic collapse of the spiritual organism.

#### **1.2.2 The Definition of Profanation: The Fatal Mixture**

The user's intuition links the "empty house" to **profanation**, a connection explicitly confirmed by the research material. Profanation is distinct from simple sin. Simple sin is the commission of evil from ignorance, weakness, or heredity. Profanation is the *mixing* of the holy and the profane. It occurs when a person first acknowledges truth (sweeps the house) and perhaps even lives by it for a time, but then internally returns to their former evils (the unclean spirit returns).  
This mixing fuses the image of heaven with the image of hell within the mind. Because these two opposing realities must be separated for a soul to exist in the afterlife (one cannot be in both heaven and hell simultaneously), the result of profanation is a "total vastation" or spiritual destruction that is "worse than the first" state of simple ignorance.

* **The Mechanism of the Worse State:** Why is the last state worse? Because the "garnishing" (the knowledge of truth) is now used to serve the "seven spirits" (the deeper evils). The person uses their theological knowledge to rationalize, defend, and hide their corruption. They become a "whited sepulcher." The "Passive Kenosis" model creates the ideal conditions for profanation because it emphasizes the *removal* of the negative (sweeping) without ensuring the immediate and permanent *implanting* of the positive (Divine Love) which alone can hold the house against the return of the spirits.

### **1.3 The "Waterless Places": The Wandering Spirit**

The parable notes the spirit wanders through **"waterless places"** (dry places).

* **Water as Truth:** In the Science of Correspondences, **water** signifies Truth.  
* **The Rejection of the Void:** The unclean spirit (evil love) cannot find rest in "waterless places" (states void of truth) because evil *requires* falsity to justify its existence. Evil cannot survive in the naked light; it needs the "water" of false reasoning to sustain its life. It returns to the house precisely because it finds the house "garnished" (filled with intellectual concepts it can pervert). If the house were truly full of *Living Water* (Truth from Good), the spirit would be repelled. But because the house is "waterless" in the sense of lacking *living* truth (truth conjoined with love), the spirit returns to claim the "garnishing" for itself.

## **Part II: The Christological Exception: Exinanition vs. Kenosis**

A common error in spiritual literature is to apply the concept of *kenosis* directly to human regeneration without qualification. This section examines why the "emptying" of Christ was a unique ontological necessity that cannot be replicated by humans without catastrophic spiritual consequences.

### **2.1 The "Divine Human" Profile: Alignment vs. Emptying**

The document *The Divine Human in Ultimates: A Phenomenological and Forensic Re-Evaluation of the Aligned Soul* provides the theological key for understanding why "Kenosis" is a trap for humans while Jesus's process was legitimate. The answer lies in the distinction between **Alignment** (the silencing of the Proprium through active receptivity) and **Self-Emptying** (the passive creation of a vacuum).

#### **2.1.1 The Christological Exception vs. The Anthropological Trap**

The central argument is this: "Kenosis... insinuates that we have to empty ourselves first, which is absolutely not true." The framework clarifies that Jesus was not "God in a suit" but a complete human soul who achieved *maximal transparency* to the Divine.

* **The Mechanism of Alignment:** Jesus's divinity was not biological—it was the result of completely silencing the *proprium* (self-love). As the document states: "Because there was no 'self' blocking the light, the 'Lord in Ultimates' could shine through him perfectly." His statements "I can do nothing on my own" (John 5:19) and "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone" (Mark 10:18) confirm he viewed himself as the *servant* of the flow, not the *source*.
* **The Vulnerability of Gethsemane:** Jesus genuinely experienced **Exinanition** (Emptying)—feeling the total absence of the Divine ("My God, why have you forsaken me?"). This was not a divine pantomime; it was the authentic human experience of a soul facing death. His victory was remaining loyal even when he felt abandoned.
* **The Trap for Humans:** The critical distinction is that Jesus's "emptying" occurred *within* a soul already perfectly aligned with the Lord. For ordinary humans, who have not achieved this alignment, attempting "emptying" without the immediate influx of the Lord creates the Empty House. We do not have the same transparent vessel that can be safely evacuated. Our mechanism must be **active displacement**—the shunning of evils through a life of use—not passive evacuation.
* **The Category Error:** Applying the model of Jesus's experience directly to human regeneration is a category error. Jesus was a human *filled* with the Lord; we are humans filled with the *proprium*. He could experience "emptying" because the Lord was the atmosphere of his soul. We cannot create emptiness and expect the Lord to appear; we must *act in service* and let the Lord displace the self through the good that flows in.

## **Part III: The Mechanism of Active Displacement (Divine Hydrodynamics)**

The user posits a corrective model: *"It is the Lord that drives out falsity through the good of love that flows in... Not by holding back, but by putting into action."* This section substantiates this "Active Displacement" model using the physics of Influx found in the research material.

### **3.1 The Law of Influx: Nature Abhors a Vacuum**

The research explicitly states that "nothing can be continued by what is empty or a vacuum". In the spiritual world, a vacuum is impossible because affection (love) is the very substance of life. If one love is removed, another *must* rush in to fill the void. The mind is a vessel that must be filled.

#### **3.1.1 Displacement vs. Removal**

The concept of "removal" in Swedenborgian thought is nuanced. Evils are not "cast out" in the sense of being annihilated or surgically extracted leaving a hole. They are **displaced** to the periphery.

* **The Mechanism:** When a person actively wills a Good (e.g., acts fairly in business because it is a sin to steal), the Lord enters through that Good. The influx of this new Love occupies the center of the mind. The former evil love (theft) is pushed to the circumference. It remains (for evils are never totally abolished), but it is quiescent and powerless as long as the Good occupies the center.  
* **Why Emptiness Fails:** If a person tries to "empty" the theft without loving the fairness (i.e., stopping theft only for reputation's sake), the center remains occupied by *self-love* (reputation). The house is "swept" of the *act* of theft, but the *spirit* of theft (self-love) remains, now disguised as a "moral" spirit. This disguise is the "seven spirits worse than the first." The emptiness of *divine* love allows the self-love to expand and occupy the whole house.

### **3.2 The Role of "Water" and "Washing"**

The user states: *"It is what water means, the washing away of falsities by truths. And truths come from an active life..."* The research confirms this correspondence in high fidelity.

#### **3.2.1 Water as Truth in Action**

* **Water \= Truth:** Water corresponds to the "truths of faith" or the "scientifics of the mind".  
* **Washing \= Active Purification:** "Washing" signifies purification from evils. However, washing is an *action*. One applies water (truth) to the body (life). Truths do not purify by being *known* (stored in the memory). They purify by being *used* to identify and shun evils in daily life.  
* **The Pool of Bethesda:** The research highlights the invalid at the Pool of Bethesda who waited for the water to be troubled. This figure represents the "passive" waiter who refuses the active life. Jesus's command—"Pick up your bed and walk"—is the command to initiate the Active Life. The healing comes in the *walking*, not in the passive lying by the water. The "water" of truth is only effective when agitated by the "fire" of an active will.

### **3.3 The "Active Life" as the Only Safe Container**

The user argues that "In an active life the Lord can only flow in." This is the theological crux of the report.

#### **3.3.1 Monasticism vs. Use**

Swedenborg explicitly rejects "piety" and "monasticism" as vehicles for regeneration. A life of withdrawal removes the *opportunities* for temptation and victory. If one secludes oneself, one cannot be tempted by the neighbor's behavior, and therefore one cannot actively *choose* charity over anger.

* **The Hamster Wheel of Piety:** Attempting regeneration outside of an active life of service is described as a "hamster wheel of continual effort for very little result". It leads to self-absorption. The "empty house" is the house of the recluse who has swept away the world but has not invited in the neighbor.  
* **Charity as the Filler:** Charity (Love toward the neighbor) is the only substance dense enough to displace the *Proprium*. The "empty house" is empty precisely because it lacks Charity. The "sweeping" (reformation) must be simultaneous with "furnishing" (doing good works).

#### **3.3.2 The "Hyssop" and the "Vinegar"**

In the analysis of the Crucifixion , the "hyssop" (a purgative herb) acts as an external means of purification. But the ultimate goal is the "New Church," which is defined not by external cleansing but by the internal reception of the Lord. The "vinegar" (falsified truth) must be rejected, but it must be replaced by the "New Wine" of spiritual truth, which can only be held in the "New Wineskins" of a regenerate life.

## **Part IV: The Danger of "Kenotic" Spiritual Practices**

The research material allows for a critical assessment of modern spiritual practices that emphasize "emptying the mind" or "blank mind" meditation, validating the user's concern about "stopping to live."

### **4.1 The "Blank Mind" and Demonic Influx**

The snippets discussing New Age and Eastern meditation techniques highlight a specific danger that parallels the "Empty House":

* **Passive Potency:** While some mystic traditions value the "blank mind," the Swedenborgian perspective (and the user's argument) warns that a passive, empty mind creates a vacuum that attracts *any* spiritual influx, often from "enthusiastic spirits" or deceptive entities that mimic divinity.  
* **The Kundalini Warning:** Reports of "terrifying experiences" and "near death crises" associated with the indiscriminate awakening of energy in an "emptied" state corroborate the "seven spirits" warning. Without the structure of rational truth and the grounding of active charity, the "emptied" mind has no defense system. The "empty house" becomes a playground for spirits who seek a vessel.  
* **Biblical Meditation vs. Emptying:** The report contrasts "New Age" emptying with "Biblical meditation," which is described as *filling* the mind with the Law of the Lord (Psalm 1). The Swedenborgian practice is one of "reflection on ends that are uses" , not the cessation of thought.

### **4.2 "Safe" Kenosis: The Aligned Soul**

How, then, does one reconcile the "Kenosis" of Jesus (which was good) with the "Empty House" (which was bad)? The document *The Divine Human in Ultimates: ...Aligned Soul* provides the answer through the concept of **Alignment** rather than Emptiness.

* **Transparency, not Vacancy:** The goal is not to become a vacuum, but to become *transparent*. A window is "empty" of color, which allows the light to pass through. But the window is a solid structure (glass). The "transparency" is achieved by the *ordering* of the structure, not its removal.  
* **The Structure of Truth:** The "house" must be built of *Truths* (stones/timber). A strong intellectual framework (doctrine) provides the necessary walls.  
* **The Atmosphere of Love:** The "air" inside the house must be Love (Heat).  
* **Operational Definition:** True Kenosis is the *silencing of the self-will* (Proprium) so that the Divine Will can act. This is an active silence—a focused listening and obedience—not a passive catatonic state. It is the difference between a soldier standing at attention (active readiness/emptied of personal whim) and a soldier asleep (passive/empty).

## **Part V: Second-Order Insights: The "Proprium" as the Barrier**

The underlying theme connecting all these data points is the nature of the **Proprium** (Self-hood). The user's query implies a sophisticated understanding of this concept.

### **5.1 The Proprium cannot be "Emptied," only "Subjugated"**

Standard "Kenosis" theory often implies the ego can be annihilated. The research suggests this is impossible for humans. The *Proprium* is the necessary container of individual identity. If it were removed, the person would cease to exist or merge into an undifferentiated divine soup (which Swedenborg rejects).

* **The User's Correction:** The user is right that "we don't empty ourselves." We cannot. We can only *orient* the Proprium. We turn the "self" from a master into a servant.  
* **The Role of Influx:** It is the *Influx* that holds the Proprium in check. The Lord "withholds" man from his own evil. If the Influx (Good of Love) were withdrawn, the person would instantly snap back into their Proprium (the Unclean Spirit returning). This proves the "Empty House" is a state where the person tries to maintain goodness *without* the continuous Influx of the Lord—an impossibility. The "swept" state is an attempt at *autonomous* goodness, which is the definition of self-righteousness (a deep evil).

### **5.2 The "Volunteer Soul" and the Active Commission**

The document *A Substantial Profile of the Volunteer Soul* reinforces the "Active Life" thesis.

* **The Call to Service:** Advanced souls or "Volunteer Souls" are defined by a **Mission** (active service), not by their ability to meditate in caves. Their "Kenosis" is the sacrifice of their pre-incarnate comfort to enter the "mud" of earth and work.  
* **Commissioning:** The "Revelatory Intervention" is always a commissioning *to do something*. It is never a call to mere emptiness. The "emptying" of their previous identity is only to make room for the *Commission*.

## **Part VI: Conclusion and Synthesis**

The user's argument is robust and supported by a deep reading of the provided theological archive. The concept of *Kenosis*, if interpreted as a "Passive Emptying" or a prerequisite state of vacancy before the Divine can enter, is indeed a trap that leads to the "Empty House" scenario of Matthew 12\.  
**The Core Findings:**

1. **The Vacuum is Fatal:** A spiritual vacuum is impossible. A mind swept of one evil must be immediately filled with a corresponding Good (Use), or the evil will return with greater force (Profanation).  
2. **Regeneration is Active:** The Lord drives out falsity *through* the influx of the Good of Love. This influx requires an active vessel—a life of charity and usefulness—to be received. Passive seclusion closes the vessel.  
3. **Reframing Kenosis:** The valid form of Kenosis is **"Active Displacement."** It is the active shunning of evils *as sins* (an action of the will) which opens the door for the Lord to enter and displace the Proprium.  
4. **The Christological Exception:** While Jesus's process of *Exinanition* was a necessary emptying to experience temptation as a human, human regeneration is not a replication of Jesus's ontological state but a *cooperation* with His Influx. We do not "empty" ourselves to become God; we "open" ourselves to be filled by Him.

**Final Verdict:** The "Empty House" parable is the master-key. It serves as a divine warning that moral reformation (sweeping) without spiritual regeneration (filling with Love via active life) is the specific recipe for Profanation—the worst of all spiritual states. The user's insistence on an "Active Life of honest love" is theologically accurate and the necessary antidote to the "Kenosis Trap." The house must never be empty; it must be the busy, inhabited workshop of the Lord.

| Concept | Passive Kenosis (The Trap) | Active Displacement (The Solution) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mechanism** | Self-emptying, suppression of ego | Shunning evils as sins, doing uses |
| **State of Mind** | Empty, swept, garnished (Intellectual) | Inhabited by Love (Volitional) |
| **Role of Truth** | Abstract knowledge, doctrine | Water for washing (Application) |
| **Outcome** | Vacuum, return of 7 spirits, Profanation | Influx of Good, removal of Proprium |
| **Lifestyle** | Seclusion, monasticism, meditation | Active life, charity, service |
| **Biblical Image** | The Empty House (Matt 12\) | The Walking Man (John 5\) |
