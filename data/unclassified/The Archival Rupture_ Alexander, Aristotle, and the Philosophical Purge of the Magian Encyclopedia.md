## **I. Introduction: The Epistemological Fracture and the Targeted Archive**

The conflagration that consumed the Achaemenid palace complex at Persepolis in 330 BCE constitutes one of the defining ruptures in the intellectual history of antiquity. Conventional historiography, relying principally on the Greek vulgate tradition of Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and Arrian, has traditionally framed this event as a singular moment of military excess—either a calculated act of political vengeance for the Persian destruction of the Athenian Acropolis in 480 BCE or, more scandalously, the impulsive climax of a drunken symposiastic revelry instigated by the courtesan Thaïs. Within this narrative, the burning of the royal archives is treated as collateral damage, a tragic but unintended consequence of the destruction of the seat of Persian power. However, a rigorous forensic analysis of the available Zoroastrian historiography, when triangulated with the philosophical trajectory of the Greek Academy from Plato to Aristotle, suggests a radically different and far more systematic hypothesis. This report investigates the proposition that the destruction of the Persian archives was neither accidental nor purely punitive, but a targeted, philosophically motivated act of "epistemicide" and appropriation—a "hostile takeover" of the ancient Magian scientific corpus known as the *Dāmdād Nask*, guided by the intellectual exigencies of the Aristotelian project.  
The hypothesis under investigation posits that the destruction was not a rejection of Persian knowledge *in toto*, but a surgical operation designed to sever the observation of the natural world from the theological ontology that governed Magian science. In the Zoroastrian tradition, specifically within the *Dēnkard* and the *Book of Arda Viraf*, Alexander is not merely "The Accursed" (*gizistag*) destroyer, but a thief of knowledge who ordered the translation of scientific texts into Greek before consigning the theological originals to the flames. This act represents the physical manifestation of what can be termed the "Epistemological Fracture"—a tectonic shift in human cognition where the unified, correspondential science of the Ancient Near East was shattered, its data extracted for the new Hellenistic sciences, and its spiritual causalities rejected as "corrupt" superstition. The destruction of the *Dāmdād Nask* was not merely the burning of books; it was the deliberate dismantling of a worldview.  
To understand the gravity of this event, one must look beyond the ruins of the palace to the contents of the archives themselves. The *Dež ī Nibišt* (Fortress of Archives) and the *Ganj ī Šāpīgān* (Royal Treasury) reportedly housed the Avesta and its Zand (commentary) written in gold ink on 12,000 prepared ox-hides. Among these texts was the *Dāmdād Nask*, an encyclopedic treatise on the creation and maintenance of the cosmos, covering botany, zoology, medicine, and astronomy. This was not secular science in the modern sense, but a "Hadha-manthric" discipline rooted in the "Science of Correspondences," which viewed every physical object (*gētīg*) as the necessary "ultimate" or effect of a spiritual cause (*mēnōg*).  
The investigation that follows traces the intellectual lineage of this destruction. It argues that the Greek Academy, particularly through the influence of Eudoxus of Cnidus and Plato, was well aware of the value of this "true" Zoroastrian science, distinguishing it sharply from the perceived corruption of contemporary magical practices (*goetia*). Aristotle, standing at the culmination of this lineage, advised a selective preservation: the extraction of the "kernel" of empirical data (the *techne* and *episteme*) and the destruction of the "shell" of theological correspondence. The result was the birth of Hellenistic science—a discipline possessed of vast data but severed from the vertical causality that had defined the ancient world.

## **II. The Magian Episteme: The Structure of the Target**

To understand why the *Dāmdād Nask* was a target for both translation and destruction, one must first comprehend the unique epistemological framework it represented. The Magian intellectual tradition was not a monolithic superstition but a highly structured system of knowledge management that categorized reality through the lens of "Universal Correspondence." This system posited a universe that was morally legible, where the physical characteristics of an object were direct signatures of its spiritual allegiance and function.

### **A. The Dāmdād Nask and the Hadha-manthric Corpus**

The Sasanian Avesta, as recalled by the later tradition, was divided into three functional categories: the *Gāhānīg* (Gathic/Liturgical), the *Dādīg* (Legal), and the *Hadha-manthric* (Scientific/Mixed). The *Dāmdād Nask* ("The Nask of the Creation of Creatures") belonged to this third category. It was, in effect, the "Scientific Avesta," an encyclopedic volume that functioned as a "Universal Taxonomy of Correspondence".  
While the liturgical texts (*Manthra*) were preserved orally to maintain the phonological sanctity of the sacred word—a practice that ensured their survival even after the material destruction of the archives—the *Hadha-manthric* texts contained "low-constraint" taxonomic data that necessitated a written tradition. Lists of plant species, astronomical tables of planetary motion, medical recipes involving specific ratios of ingredients, and geographical surveys of the *Karshvars* (climes) could not be trusted to the fluid memory of oral recitation. These were likely recorded on perishable media like parchment or ox-hides, making them uniquely vulnerable to physical destruction.  
The contents of the *Dāmdād Nask*, partially reconstructed in the 9th-century *Bundahišn* and the *Selections of Zādspram*, reveal a sophisticated biological and cosmological system. It classified the natural world not merely by morphology or utility, but by spiritual alignment. Animals were not just biological entities but "beneficent" (*gōspand*) or "noxious" (*xrafstra*), categories that denoted their ontological function in the cosmic war between Ahura Mazda (Order/Truth) and Angra Mainyu (Chaos/Lie). This classification extended to botany, where plants were categorized by their capacity to heal or poison, corresponding to their celestial patrons. This was a "Science of Correspondences" where the physical world (*gētīg*) was the visible manifestation of a spiritual cause (*mēnōg*).

### **B. The Ontology of Mēnōg and Gētīg**

> **[REFRAMING #11]**: This section treats the mēnōg/gētīg ontology as a "threat" that could be destroyed by burning archives. However, correspondence is **ontological law**, not transmittable doctrine. The Göbekli Tepe animal arrangements (9500 BCE) show the same correspondential classification 7,000 years before Zoroaster—with no transmission chain. Alexander could destroy the *texts* but not the *perceivable reality* that generated them.

The core philosophical threat the *Dāmdād Nask* posed to the emerging Aristotelian worldview lay in its rigorous dualist ontology. Magian science posited that the universe originated in a spiritual state (*mēnōg*) before precipitating into a material state (*gētīg*). This was not a vague mysticism but a precise causal mechanics.

* **Mēnōg (Mental/Spiritual):** The realm of the seed, the archetype, and the cause. It is invisible, immaterial, but fully real. In this state, entities exist as pure potential and moral intent.  
* **Gētīg (Material/Physical):** The realm of the fruit, the manifestation, and the effect. It is the "bone" or "crystallization" of the spiritual intent.

In this system, a plant does not exist solely because of biological evolution or environmental adaptation; it exists because it corresponds to a specific "Divine Affection" or spiritual truth. The *Dāmdād Nask* mapped these correspondences rigorously. For example, the human body was treated as a microcosm ("Small World") of the macrocosm ("Great Man"), where specific organs corresponded to planetary spheres and geological features. The *Bundahišn* details how the "Tree of All Seeds" contains the prototypes of all vegetation, a direct *mēnōg* source for the *gētīg* diversity of plant life.  
This worldview stands in direct contrast to the developing naturalism of Aristotle, for whom the "form" (*eidos*) exists within the matter, not in a separate, causal spiritual realm. The Magian system required a "double vision"—seeing the object and its spiritual cause simultaneously. The loss of this faculty, identified in the research as the "Epistemological Fracture," meant that later generations could see the "shell" (the physical object) but had lost the "kernel" (the spiritual meaning).

### **C. The "Kernel" and the "Shell" of Knowledge**

The metaphor of the "kernel" and the "shell" is central to understanding the Magian view of the catastrophe. The *Dāmdād Nask* represented the "kernel"—the explanatory scientific key (Zand) that unlocked the meaning of the rituals. The liturgy and the external laws represented the "shell."  
When Alexander destroyed the archives, he effectively stripped the "shell" of its "kernel." The rituals survived in the oral memory of the priests (who could recite the *Yasna* by heart), but the encyclopedic knowledge of *why* the rituals worked—the astronomical calculations of the feast days, the botanical properties of the *Haoma*, the medical correspondences of the purification rites—was housed in the unique written copies of the *Hadha-manthric* Nasks. The destruction of the *Dāmdād Nask* rendered the surviving Zoroastrianism a "locked" religion, its practices continuing by rote tradition while the "scientific" understanding of the cosmos was fragmented or transferred into the hands of Greek natural philosophers. This created a permanent schism in the Iranian tradition, where the *Manthra* (Holy Word) remained, but the *Zand* (Understanding) was alienated.

## **III. The Academy and the East: The Philosophical Motive**

The destruction of Persepolis was not an isolated military incident but the culmination of a centuries-long intellectual engagement between the Greek Academy and the Magian priesthood. The "Science of Correspondences" did not arrive in Athens by accident; it was imported through specific vectors, primarily Eudoxus of Cnidus, and deeply influenced the philosophical maturation of Plato and Aristotle. The Greek Academy's attitude toward the East was characterized by a profound ambivalence: a reverence for the "ancient" wisdom of Zoroaster and a simultaneous disdain for the "corrupt" practices of the contemporary Magi.

### **A. Eudoxus of Cnidus: The Architect of Transmission**

Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 390–337 BCE), a mathematician, astronomer, and acting head of the Academy during Plato's absences, serves as the pivotal link in this transmission. Pliny the Elder explicitly records that Eudoxus declared Zoroaster to be the "most useful" (*utilissimus*) of philosophers and dated him to 6,000 years before Plato.  
This endorsement is significant. It suggests that Eudoxus viewed Zoroastrianism not merely as a foreign religion but as a pragmatic system of knowledge—a "useful" philosophy. Eudoxus’s own work in astronomy, specifically the theory of concentric spheres, bears a structural resemblance to the Magian cosmology of the *Dāmdād Nask*, which described the universe as a series of concentric protective spheres (or *Karshvars*).  
Eudoxus traveled extensively in Egypt and likely had contact with Magian priests operating within the Persian satrapies. His validation of Zoroaster legitimised the study of Oriental wisdom within the Academy, creating an intellectual climate where the "Magian Science" was seen as a reservoir of ancient, pristine truth that had been lost to the Greeks. This pre-disposed the Academy to view the Persian archives not as barbarian ramblings, but as a repository of "Source Code" for the cosmos. It was Eudoxus who likely first introduced the specific details of the *mēnōg*/*gētīg* distinction to Plato, framing it in the geometric language of Forms and Particulars.

### **B. Plato’s Bricolage and the "Myth of Er"**

The influence of this Magian data on Plato is evident in his later period, where he engages in what can be termed "mythic bricolage"—the restructuring of Greek dialectic using Magian ontological bricks. The most contentious piece of evidence for this is the accusation by the Epicurean Colotes of Lampsacus (3rd century BCE) that Plato plagiarized his "Myth of Er" (Republic X) from a Zoroastrian text titled *On Nature*.  
The "Myth of Er" describes a journey of the soul through a concentric cosmos, involving judgment, planetary spheres, and the choice of a next life. This narrative structure is strikingly isomorphic to the *Book of Arda Viraf* and the cosmography of the *Dāmdād Nask*. The Zoroastrian *Arda Viraf* travels through Heaven, Hell, and *Hamistagan* (a Purgatory or "Place of the Mixed"), guided by Sraosha and Atar, just as Er is guided through the planetary whorls. The "Spindle of Necessity" in Plato corresponds to the "Chinvat Bridge" and the planetary spheres traversed by the soul in the *Hadha-manthric* texts.  
The "Science of Correspondences" hypothesis argues that Plato did not "invent" these myths but adapted translated summaries of the *Hadha-manthric* texts provided by Eudoxus or Hermodorus. Plato’s *Timaeus*, with its geometric atomism and the role of the Demiurge, also reflects a systematization of the Magian *mēnōg*/*gētīg* dualism. The Demiurge (Divine Craftsman) looks to the eternal Forms (*mēnōg*) to fashion the material world (*gētīg*) within the Receptacle (*chora*). Plato represents an attempt to "rescue" this ancient science of vertical causality before the "Epistemological Fracture" became total. He tried to translate the intuitive "perception" of the Golden Age into the "reason" of the Iron Age.

### **C. Aristotle: The Distinction Between Ancient Wisdom and Modern Magic**

Aristotle’s relationship with the Magi is complex and marks the shift from preservation to appropriation. While Plato and Eudoxus looked to Zoroaster with reverence as an ancient sage, Aristotle introduced a critical distinction between the "ancient" Zoroaster and the "contemporary" Magi.  
In his lost dialogue *On Philosophy* (*Peri Philosophias*) and the treatise *Magikos*, Aristotle acknowledges the Magi as being "more ancient than the Egyptians" and credits them with the doctrine of two principles: Oromasdes (Zeus/Good) and Areimanius (Hades/Evil). He recognizes their philosophical pedigree. However, Aristotle was also a rigorous naturalist who rejected the independent existence of Platonic Forms (*mēnōg*). For Aristotle, the "form" was immanent in the matter.  
The "Science of Correspondences," which relied on the separation of spiritual cause and natural effect, was philosophically incompatible with Aristotle’s physics. Yet, the *data* contained in the Magian books—the observations of stars, plants, and animals—was invaluable. Aristotle faced a dilemma: the Persian archives contained the empirical data he craved for his natural histories (biology, meteorology, astronomy), but it was encoded in a theological framework he rejected.  
This creates the motive for the "Alexandrian solution": extract the data (translation) and eliminate the framework (destruction). Aristotle advised Alexander to treat the Greeks as a leader and the barbarians as a master (treating them like plants or animals) , a sentiment that aligns with the "strip-mining" of their intellectual resources. The *Dāmdād Nask* was to be harvested for its *facts*, stripped of its *correspondences*. Aristotle’s interest was in the *classification* of the animals (as seen in his *History of Animals*), not in their function as *gōspand* or *xrafstra* in a cosmic war.

## **IV. The Alexandrian Event: The Translation and the Arson**

The actual mechanism of this "epistemicide" is detailed in Zoroastrian historiography, which offers a narrative radically different from the Greek accounts of accidental fire. The burning of Persepolis was not merely an act of arson; it was the final stage of a data extraction process.

### **A. The "Translation Order"**

The *Dēnkard* (Book 4 and Book 3, Chapter 420\) and the *Book of Arda Viraf* provide a specific account of Alexander's actions regarding the archives. They state:  
"He \[Alexander\] killed the ruler of Iran... and this religious tradition (dēn), the entire Avesta and Zand as it was written on adorned ox-hides in golden ink, had been placed in Pābak's (city of) Istaxr in the Fortress of Archives (diž ī nipišt). That ill-omened adversary... carried them off and burnt them."  
Crucially, the *Dēnkard* adds a vital detail regarding the *Ganj ī Šāpīgān* (Royal Treasury):  
"That which was in the fortress of documents came to be burnt; and that in the treasury... was translated by him even into the Greek language, as information which was connected \[with the sciences\]...".  
This "Translation Order" is the smoking gun of the hypothesis. Alexander did not indiscriminately burn everything. The texts in the treasury—likely the "working copies" or the specific scientific Nasks valued by court astronomers and physicians—were seized and translated. The target was the *Hadha-manthric* corpus: the *Dāmdād Nask* (Cosmogony/Natural History), the *Tištar Yašt* (Astronomy), and the medical treatises. This confirms that the destruction was selective: science was to be appropriated; theology was to be annihilated.

### **B. "Strip-Mining" the Dāmdād Nask**

The *Dāmdād Nask*, as the encyclopedia of creation, was the primary victim of this policy. It contained the "Source Code" of Magian science. By translating it, the Greeks acquired:

1. **Astronomical Data:** Centuries of observations from the Babylonian and Iranian plateaus, which fueled the sudden leap in Hellenistic astronomy (e.g., Hipparchus and Ptolemy). The precise tables of planetary motion found in later Greek astronomy likely have their roots in these translations.  
2. **Botanical and Zoological Taxonomies:** The detailed classification of plants and animals (Beneficent vs. Noxious) found in the *Bundahišn* suggests a rigor that parallels, and perhaps informed, Aristotle’s *History of Animals* and Theophrastus’s *Enquiry into Plants*. The Greeks adopted the descriptive data but discarded the dualistic categorization.  
3. **Medical Knowledge:** The Magian division of medicine into knife, herb, and mantra was integrated into the rationalist Greek medical tradition, stripping away the "mantra" (spiritual) element.

Once the "useful" information (the *utilissimus* part praised by Eudoxus) was extracted into Greek, the original ox-hides—written in Avestan/Aramaic scripts and inextricably linked to the "corrupt" dualistic theology—were burned. This was a "cleansing" of the data, liberating it from its "superstitious" shell.

### **C. The Role of Hermippus and the Library**

The hypothesis is further supported by the figure of Hermippus of Smyrna (3rd century BCE). Pliny records that Hermippus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria, "explained the contents of two million verses composed by Zoroaster" and compiled an index of them.  
Where did Hermippus get access to "two million verses" of Zoroaster in Alexandria, barely a century after Alexander? The answer, under this hypothesis, is that these were the very translations ordered by Alexander from the Persepolis archives. The Library of Alexandria became the new repository for the "sanitized" Magian science. The *Dāmdād Nask* did not vanish; it metamorphosed into the Greek scientific corpus, leaving the Persian priesthood with only the memory of the texts and the oral liturgy. Hermippus’s work represents the cataloging of the loot—the organization of the "foreign wisdom" into the Hellenistic canon.

## **V. Philosophical Motivation: Corruption vs. Purity**

Why was destruction necessary? Why not simply keep the originals? The answer lies in the philosophical battle over the nature of "true" science and the Aristotelian drive to rationalize the cosmos.

### **A. The "True" Science vs. Contemporary Corruption**

By the 4th century BCE, Greek intellectuals like Plato and Aristotle drew a sharp line between the "ancient" wisdom of Zoroaster (which they idealized) and the practices of the contemporary Magi (which they often viewed as *goetia* or sorcery).

* **The Ancient Zoroaster:** Viewed as a proto-philosopher, a star-gazer, and a master of natural science. Eudoxus and Aristotle praised this figure as the discoverer of wisdom (*sophia*).  
* **The Contemporary Magi:** Seen by some Greeks, particularly the more rationalist factions, as engaging in "begging-priest" rituals, incantations, and "magic" in the pejorative sense. The term *goetia* was used to describe low magic, distinct from the high *mageia* or *theurgia* attributed to Zoroaster.

The destruction of the Avestan archives can be interpreted as a "Reformation" by fire. By destroying the contemporary texts—which bound the scientific data to a "corrupt" priestly hierarchy and ritual system—Alexander and his advisors may have believed they were liberating the "true" ancient science of Zoroaster. They were rescuing the *essence* (the logical data) from the *accident* (the Persian cult). This mirrors the Platonic critique of writing in the *Phaedrus*, where the written word is seen as a dead image of living truth—perhaps the Greeks felt justified in destroying the "dead letter" of the Persian books to appropriate the "living spirit" of the science.

### **B. Aristotle’s Rationalizing Project**

Aristotle’s philosophy required a stable, eternal world where causes were immanent. The Magian worldview, with its battles between cosmic spirits, its creation from a spiritual *mēnōg*, and its reliance on "correspondences," was fundamentally incompatible with Aristotelian naturalism. The *Dāmdād Nask* described a universe where a "Sole-Created Ox" was the progenitor of all animals and where disease was an invasion by a demon (*Druj*).  
However, Aristotle was also a pragmatist. He needed data. The "Translation Order" reflects an Aristotelian approach to knowledge: **collection, categorization, and rationalization**. The *Dāmdād Nask* was a treasure trove of raw data. The goal was to assimilate this data into the new, universal Greek *episteme* while erasing the "barbarian" authority that produced it.  
This mirrors the "Letter of Tansar" tradition where Alexander is advised to kill the Persian elites (the carriers of the tradition) but is eventually told to divide them to prevent unity. Destroying the central archive at Persepolis and translating the science effectively "divided" the knowledge, breaking the monopoly of the Magian priesthood and preventing the resurrection of their theocratic power. The burning was a technology of control, ensuring that the source of the knowledge would be forgotten, leaving only the Greek derivative as the authoritative text.

## **VI. The Aftermath: Reconstruction and the Lost Word**

The consequences of this "Archival Rupture" were profound and permanent, shaping the trajectory of both Western science and Eastern religion. It created two divergent streams of knowledge: a Western science bereft of spiritual causality and an Eastern religion bereft of its scientific foundation.

### **A. The Hellenistic Boom and the Persian Vacuum**

Following the conquest, the Greek world experienced an unprecedented explosion in scientific output. The Museum at Alexandria became the center of a new, data-driven science. Under this hypothesis, this boom was fueled by the influx of "strip-mined" data from the *Dāmdād Nask* and Babylonian archives. The Greeks didn't just "invent" these sciences; they processed and systematized the data harvested from the East. The sudden appearance of detailed star catalogs and biological taxonomies in the Hellenistic period is the fruit of the translation order.  
In contrast, Iran entered a "dark age" of literacy. The *Dēnkard* laments that the transmission of the Avesta became fragmented and oral. The "scientific" Nasks were lost. It was not until the Sasanian period (3rd–7th centuries CE) that kings like Ardashir I and Shapur I attempted to "collect back" the scattered teachings from the Greeks and Indians. They explicitly sought to repatriate the *scientific* knowledge (medicine, astronomy) that Alexander had "dispersed." This Sasanian restoration was essentially a salvage operation to reconstruct the *Dāmdād Nask* from Greek translations and surviving oral fragments—a reverse translation order. The *Dēnkard* itself is a product of this reconstruction, a "patchwork" encyclopedia trying to rebuild the shattered whole.

### **B. The Arabic Tradition: The "Secret of Secrets"**

The memory of this event and the relationship between Aristotle and Alexander survived in the Islamic world, mutated into the legend of the *Sirr al-Asrar* (Secret of Secrets). This pseudo-Aristotelian text, widely popular in the Middle Ages, purports to be a letter from Aristotle to Alexander advising him on statecraft and "secret" knowledge.  
While apocryphal, the *Sirr al-Asrar* preserves the *idea* of Aristotle as the guiding hand behind Alexander’s policies in Persia. In some versions, Aristotle advises Alexander not to kill the Persian elites but to govern them; in others, he provides esoteric knowledge about the "nature" of the lands. This reflects a garbled memory of the actual policy: the appropriation of Persian "secrets" (science) and the management of the Persian state. The text’s focus on physiognomy, medicine, and astrology—topics covered in the *Dāmdād Nask*—suggests a lingering association between Aristotelian advice and Magian science.

### **C. Swedenborg and the "Ancient Word"**

The long-term esoteric legacy of this rupture is articulated by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century. He posited the existence of a "Most Ancient Church" (Golden Age) and an "Ancient Church" (Silver Age) that possessed the "Science of Correspondences". He explicitly linked this lost knowledge to the "Ancient Word" preserved in "Great Tartary" (Central Asia/Eastern Iran), identifying it with the pre-Abrahamic wisdom of the East.  
Swedenborg’s narrative aligns perfectly with the Zoroastrian account of the *Dāmdād Nask*. The "Ancient Word" is the lost *Hadha-manthric* corpus. The "loss of perception" he describes corresponds to the "Epistemological Fracture" where humanity lost the ability to read the *mēnōg* causes in *gētīg* effects. The destruction of the archives was the physical sealing of this loss. For Swedenborg, and for the later Platonists, the task of philosophy became *anamnesis*—trying to remember the integrated science that was burned at Persepolis.

## **VII. Conclusion: The Fire and the Fragment**

The investigation supports the hypothesis that the destruction of the Persian archives was a targeted, philosophically motivated act. Alexander the Great, influenced by the Aristotelian distinction between "data" and "superstition" and conditioned by the earlier Academic views of Eudoxus, executed a "hostile takeover" of the Magian episteme.

1. **The Motive:** To acquire the *techne* of the *Dāmdād Nask* (astronomy, medicine, agriculture) while eradicating the *theology* that underpinned it. Aristotle sought the facts of the *gētīg* world but rejected the *mēnōg* causality.  
2. **The Method:** A systematic "Translation Order" targeting the *Hadha-manthric* encyclopedias, followed by the incineration of the original texts to prevent the re-establishment of the Magian priestly power structure.  
3. **The Result:** The "Epistemological Fracture." The West inherited the "shell" of the science (data, observation) but discarded the "kernel" (the Science of Correspondences). The East was left with the "shell" of the ritual, having lost the scientific encyclopedia that explained it.

The "Alexander Catastrophe" was thus the birth trauma of the modern, secularized intellect. By burning the ox-hides of Persepolis, Alexander did not just destroy a library; he severed the link between the *mēnōg* and the *gētīg*, creating a world where science and spirit would henceforth wander as estranged siblings, searching for the unity that was lost in the ashes of the *Dāmdād Nask*. The legacy of this act echoes from the library of Alexandria to the *Dēnkard*, and finally to the esoteric reconstructions of the modern era, a testament to the enduring power of the knowledge that was burned but never truly extinguished.
