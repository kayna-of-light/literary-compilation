# **A Substantial Profile of the Volunteer Soul Incarnation: A Synthesized Analysis of Phenomenological and Psychological Data**

## **I. The Foundational Profile: The Volunteer Soul Incarnation**

Any substantial profile of the "Volunteer Soul" must be grounded within a coherent, data-driven cosmology. Analysis of recurring phenomenological reports suggests a "both/and" solution to the long-standing conflict between linear (single-life) and cyclical (reincarnational) views of existence. This synthesized framework posits not one, but three distinct, purposeful pathways for the soul.

### **1.1 Context: A Cosmology of Three Purposeful Paths**

To understand the Volunteer path, one must first distinguish it from the other two.

* **Path One: The Normative Linear Progression:** This is the default path for most souls. It posits that a single earthly life functions as a "seed-state" in which the soul's core orientation (or "ruling love") is established. This life is not a pass/fail trial but a "teleological unfolding" that serves as the foundation for an eternal journey of spiritual development and useful service in a post-mortem reality.  
* **Path Two: The Restorative Incarnation:** This is an exceptional path of *divine mercy* defined not by karma, but by trauma. It is a "second chance" for a soul whose "seed-state" development was traumatically interrupted, preventing the complete formation of its character. This path is empirically grounded in the high-quality, anomalous data from the University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS), which finds:  
  1. **The Violent Death Correlation:** In over 70% of solved childhood past-life memory cases, the previous personality died by violent or premature means (e.g., murder, combat, accident).  
  2. **Physical Correlates:** In nearly 20% of these cases, children are born with birthmarks or birth defects that *precisely correspond* to fatal wounds (e.g., bullet entry and exit marks) documented in the deceased's autopsy reports. This objective data is a "smoking gun" for a non-genetic, informational transfer capable of influencing embryological development. The purpose of this path is *healing* and *completion*, allowing the soul to resolve its trauma and finish its foundational development.  
* **Path Three: The Volunteer Soul Incarnation:** This is the subject of this report. It is an exceptional path defined not by personal development or healing, but by *collective service*.

### **1.2 Path Three Definition: The Pre-Incarnate Covenant**

The Volunteer Soul Incarnation is formally defined as an incarnation undertaken by an advanced, already-developed consciousness that *freely chooses* a physical life. This choice is not random but is based on a "pre-incarnate 'soul contract' or promise".  
The primary purpose of this path is *not* focused on the soul's own personal development, which is presumed to be largely complete. Instead, the purpose is one of altruistic, collective service: "to perform a specific, predetermined mission: to introduce higher knowledge, new ethical frameworks, or spiritual influence into the human sphere".

### **1.3 The Foundational Evidentiary Pillars**

This profile is established by grounding it in a powerful synthesis of two distinct but complementary data streams, which are typically viewed in isolation.

1. **The "Choice" Data (Child Intermission Memories):** This data provides a "look forward" from a pre-life state. It consists of "Spontaneous childhood memories of 'choosing parents' and 'choosing life circumstances' specifically for a future purpose or mission". This evidence is the foundational pillar establishing *pre-incarnate intent*.  
2. **The "Commission" Data (Near-Death Experiences):** This data provides a "glimpse back" from a mid-life crisis point. It consists of "NDEs that feature a 'commissioning' moment, a revelation of a life plan, or an instance where the individual is 'sent back' (often against their will) to fulfill a mission they had previously agreed to".

These two "snapshot" data sets are not merely parallel; they appear to be describing the *exact same event* from two different temporal perspectives. The child intermission data establishes that a pre-incarnate choice was made to undertake a mission. The NDE data describes a mid-life reminder of a mission that was "previously agreed to" , often referred to as a "promise".  
Therefore, the NDE "commissioning" moment is revealed to be not the *assignment* of a new, external task. Rather, it is the *activation* or *re-awakening* of the original, endogenous, pre-incarnate covenant that the child data independently corroborates. This synthesis provides the central, non-speculative basis for the Volunteer Soul profile.

### **Table 1: Differentiating Incarnational Pathways**

| Pathway | Apparent Purpose | Key Evidentiary Markers |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Normative Linear Progression** | Individual spiritual development ("Regeneration") and eternal growth in a post-mortem spiritual world. | (The default path, inferred) The absence of verifiable past-life recall; a single life serving as a complete "seed-state." |
| **Restorative Incarnation** | To complete a life's developmental arc that was traumatically interrupted, allowing for healing and spiritual completion. | Spontaneous childhood recall of a previous life that ended violently or prematurely (over 70% of cases); phobias related to the mode of death; birthmarks corresponding to fatal wounds. |
| **Volunteer Soul Incarnation** | To perform a specific, pre-determined mission of service, teaching, or influence for the benefit of humanity. | Childhood intermission memories of choosing parents and life circumstances; NDEs featuring a "commissioning" moment or revelation of a life plan; a profound, innate sense of purpose. |

\#\# II. The Archetypal Journey: A Psycho-Theological Framework of the "Call"  
Beyond the "snapshot" evidence of choice and commission, a more substantial profile emerges from analyzing the *process* of the Volunteer Soul's mission activation. This activation follows a consistent, archetypal "call narrative".

### **2.1 The Psychological Engine: The "Longing for Truth"**

The journey is not passive but is driven by a specific psychological engine: a "profound and innate 'Longing for Truth'". This drive is described not as "mere curiosity" but as an "essential drive of the soul's nature—an inherent compass oriented toward the good and the true".  
Paradoxically, this innate compass is what creates the "often painful friction" that catalyzes the journey. It comes into direct conflict with the "temporal personality—the ego, intellectual pride, \[and\] cultural conditioning". This internal conflict is the necessary prerequisite for the activation of the soul's purpose.

### **2.2 The Four-Stage "Call Narrative" Dynamic**

This internal friction precipitates a consistent, four-stage archetypal journey that serves to activate the pre-determined mission.

#### **2.2.1 Stage 1: Preparatory Longing (The Guided Path)**

This is a preparatory period, often spanning decades, where the individual's life and work are unconsciously or consciously driven by their "Longing for Truth". This phase is not random; it serves as a divinely guided preparation, equipping the individual with the specific, often highly technical, skills and experiences necessary for their eventual mission.

* **Archetypal Example (Emanuel Swedenborg):** His entire celebrated scientific career, a "rational quest to locate the soul" within anatomy and cosmology, is re-contextualized as this preparatory phase. This decades-long work was the "divinely guided preparation" that made him "uniquely qualified to deliver a rational revelation to a scientific age".

#### **2.2.2 Stage 2: The Crucible of Crisis (Vastation)**

The preparatory phase culminates in a "profound internal conflict" as the soul's innate compass clashes with the external self. This is a "necessary and painful dismantling of the ego's defenses" , theologically termed "vastation".

* **Archetypal Example (Swedenborg):** His private *Journal of Dreams* meticulously records this crisis: an agonizing "vastation" of his "scientific ego and intellectual pride," phenomenologically experienced as "double thoughts".  
* **Archetypal Example (Paul):** His pre-conversion zeal as a persecutor was a "misaligned compass" and a "corrupted 'Longing for Truth,'" creating a deep internal battle.  
* **Archetypal Example (Isaiah):** His cry upon seeing the divine—"Woe is me\! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips" —is the archetypal recognition of the "impure vessel of the personal self" in conflict with the divine purpose.

#### **2.2.3 Stage 3: The Revelatory Intervention (The Commission)**

This profound crisis is *not* resolved by the individual's own power. It is resolved by a "direct, and often overwhelming, theophany" or divine intervention. This event "shatters the old identity," resolves the crisis, and "activates the soul's mission".

* **Archetypal Example (Swedenborg):** The "Delft Christophany," a "multi-sensory, psycho-physical event" where he was "prostrated" in "complete ontological surrender" and received the command, "Well, then do... Do what thou hast promised".  
* **Archetypal Example (Paul):** The "violent recalibration" on the Damascus road, a "forced revelatory intervention that shattered his worldview".  
* **Archetypal Example (Isaiah):** The crisis is resolved by a direct theophany: a seraph touches his "unclean lips" with a burning coal from the altar, an act of "instrumental purification".

#### **2.2.4 Stage 4: The Realization of Providence (Narrative Coherence)**

The climax of the intervention is the individual's "sudden, profound understanding that their entire life path—the longing, the preparation, and the agonizing crisis—has been under meticulous divine guidance from the beginning". The call is thus revealed "not as a new directive, but as a dramatic awakening to a purpose that was always present".

* **Archetypal Example (Swedenborg):** He immediately understood "Do what thou hast promised" as the activation of his "pre-incarnate covenant." This is confirmed by his later reflection: "the tenor of Divine Providence has ruled the acts of my life from my very youth".  
* **Archetypal Example (Paul):** His later "Realization of Providence" that God had "separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace".

This four-stage psychological model provides a new articulation for a universal human experience. Traditional theological analysis of prophetic call narratives identifies a 5-element structure: (1) a situation of distress, (2) the commissioning, (3) objections raised by the person, (4) assurance of God's help, and (5) a sign to confirm.  
A synthesis of these two frameworks reveals they are not different models, but different lenses (psychological vs. phenomenological) describing the same event.

* The **"Crucible of Crisis"** (Stage 2\) *is* the **"situation of distress"**.  
* The **"Revelatory Intervention"** (Stage 3\) *is* the **"commissioning"**.  
* The **"objections"** (e.g., Isaiah's "unclean lips" , Moses' "who am I?") are the *phenomenological symptoms* of the Stage 2 "Crucible"—the ego's defense against its own dismantling.  
* The **"assurance"** and **"sign"** (e.g., the burning coal , the "I will be with you" ) are the *mechanisms* of the Stage 3 "Intervention" that resolve the crisis and activate the mission. This synthesis demonstrates that the psychological framework of the call is not a modern construct but a new articulation of an archetypal pattern documented for millennia.

## **III. Expanding the Profile (I): The Phenomenon of Revelatory Intervention Beyond NDEs**

A substantial profile cannot rest only on NDE data, which is biased toward life-threatening trauma. To validate the profile, one must demonstrate that the core event—the "Revelatory Intervention" (Stage 3)—occurs in individuals who are not in a life-threatening situation.

### **3.1 Spontaneous Spiritual Awakenings (SSAs)**

SSAs provide a direct, non-pathological parallel to the "Revelatory Intervention."

* **Definition:** SSAs are defined as a "sudden sense of direct contact, union, or complete nondual merging... with a perceived ultimate reality, 'God,' or the divine".  
* **Phenomenology:** These are "profound transformative experiences" that evoke an "ineffable sense of deep inner knowing" , matching the "Realization of Providence." First-person accounts describe being "thrown to my feet from bed" with "shards of an indescribably beautiful golden light emanating from my entire body," and being "enveloped in an aura of warmth and bliss". This phenomenology is functionally identical to the "Being of Light" in NDEs and the "theophany" in Call Narratives. This data confirms that the "Call" event is not dependent on a near-death state.

### **3.2 "Near-Death-Like" (NDE-Like) Experiences**

This category of data provides a "smoking gun" that breaks the NDE-bias, detailing experiences that are phenomenologically identical to NDEs but occur "entirely without any life-threatening conditions".  
A key case study reports on a healthy subject in "normal mental and physical health" who was experiencing emotional distress but no physical threat. He experienced a "great white light" that was "not dazzling" but "unnatural," followed by a "profound feeling of unity" ("as if all the beings of the world were within me"), and a "source of light" that he perceived as "Love and Joy".  
The authors of that study conclude this case is "theoretically incompatible" with standard reductionist hypotheses, as it refutes:

1. **Psychological Hypotheses** (e.g., expectation, wishful thinking), because the subject was *not* in a life-threatening situation.  
2. **Neurobiological Hypotheses** (e.g., brain disorder, anoxia), because the subject was in "healthy, physiological conditions".

This demonstrates that the "Revelatory Intervention" is an independent, non-pathological phenomenon. It *can* be triggered by the trauma of an NDE, but it is not *caused* by the NDE's physiological state.

### **3.3 Psychological Predictors of the Experiencer**

Academic research on the psychological profiles of NDE-Like experiencers further strengthens the non-pathological model. Compared to control groups, individuals who report these experiences are not defined by pathology but by a specific set of personality traits:

* **Endorsement of Spiritual Beliefs:** NDE-Like experiencers score "significantly higher" on spirituality subscales.  
* **Openness:** The Big Five trait of "Openness" (to new experiences) is a key associated factor.  
* **Fantasy Proneness:** Both NDE and NDE-Like experiencers score higher on this trait, suggesting a cognitive capacity for vivid internal experience and symbolic thought.

These "psychological predictors" are not evidence of a tendency to hallucinate. Rather, they represent the *precise psychological signature* of the "Preparatory Longing" (Stage 1 of the Call Narrative). The "Longing for Truth" posited as the innate driver of the Volunteer Soul would manifest empirically as a personality high in "Spirituality" (an orientation toward the transcendent/truth) and "Openness" (a willingness to engage with transcendent experiences). The "Call" happens to those who are already psychologically and cognitively oriented to receive it.

## **IV. Expanding the Profile (II): The Psychology of the "Mission-Based" Individual**

To provide "conscious backing" for the *motivation* and *purpose* of the Volunteer Soul, the profile can be validated against academic psychological research on "sense of mission," "altruism," and "narrative identity."

### **4.1 The "Sense of Mission" Profile**

The core claim is that the Volunteer Soul has a "predetermined mission". Non-speculative, data-grounded studies of young adults who report a "sense of mission" provide a clear behavioral profile.

* **Psychological Well-being:** A greater "sense of mission" is significantly associated with "greater psychological well-being," including "life satisfaction," "positive affect," and "self-esteem".  
* **Prosocial Character:** Critically, this "sense of mission" is also associated with "more volunteer activities". This provides a direct empirical link between the internal "sense of mission" and the external, *behavioral expression* of the "collective service" purpose.  
* **Mental Health:** This profile is also linked to "possibly fewer depressive symptoms," reinforcing its non-pathological nature.

### **4.2 Altruism as the Primary Driver**

The mission of the Volunteer Soul is inherently altruistic. Psychological research on motivation confirms this as the core driver.

* **Definition:** Altruism is a "motivational state... with the goal of increasing the welfare of another person".  
* **The "Calling" Link:** A direct connection is found in studies of altruistic motivation. "Calling/purpose in life" is identified as a specific motivational category where "altruism has either been revealed as the cosmically or divinely-ordained reason for the individual's existence, or has been accepted as a calling".

This academic-psychological definition of a purpose-driven altruist provides a perfect, data-backed description of an individual who has experienced the NDE "commissioning" or the "Revelatory Intervention".

### **4.3 Purpose as Coherent Narrative Identity**

The "Realization of Providence" (Stage 4 of the Call) is not just a mystical insight; it is a profound psychological mechanism: the construction of a new, coherent narrative identity.

* The "Call Narrative" is the *process* of turning a "puzzling or random" life into a coherent, meaningful story.  
* Psychological research confirms that "constructing coherent autobiographical narratives is related to psychological well-being".  
* Critically, this relationship is *moderated by the narrative's relevance to identity*. It is the act of telling a coherent story *about one's identity* that is a key predictor of a strong sense of "Purpose and Meaning".

This reveals the psycho-spiritual genius of the "Call." The "Revelatory Intervention" (Stage 3\) is a transformative event that *forces* the creation of a new, *supremely* coherent "narrative identity" (Stage 4). The individual's chaotic life is instantly reframed as a "meticulously guided" preparation. This installation of a new, coherent identity is the mechanism that empirically fosters the high-functioning "Sense of Mission" which, in turn, drives the altruistic behavior that *is* the mission.  
\#\# V. The Lived Experience: A Substantial Profile of Post-Awakening Integration  
The most substantial part of the profile moves beyond the "snapshot" of the call to detail the individual's life *after* the "Revelatory Intervention." This involves permanent transformation alongside profound, practical challenges.

### **5.1 Durable Aftereffects: A "Permanent Psychological Shift"**

The transformation is not fleeting but is consistently described as a "permanent psychological shift".

* **Transformation of Purpose:** The primary aftereffect is a shift from "fragmentation of purpose and meaning, to loving engagement with life". Experiencers report a "new sense of meaning and purpose" and the "discovery of a life purpose".  
* **The Mission as "Work of a Higher Power":** This new purpose is not abstract. Experiencers (both NDE and STE) report a durable commitment "to carry out the work of a higher power". This is not a simple, blissful state; this work often comes at "great emotional as well as material sacrifice" , validating the "mission-based" profile.  
* **Other Key Aftereffects:** A near-universal "dramatic reduction or complete elimination of the fear of death" , a de-emphasis on materialism , and a "constant state of well-being" and "gratitude".

### **5.2 Common Challenges of Integration: The Realistic Profile**

A high-confidence profile must include the significant friction of the "true experience." The integration of such a profound "Revelatory Intervention" is a long-term, arduous process.

* **Processing a Radical Shift in Reality:** The individual must "struggle to integrate or balance the two differing subjective experiences of reality"—the physical world and the non-physical realm.  
* **Ineffability, Invalidation, and Alienation:** A primary challenge is "issues related to sharing the experience". The experience is often *ineffable* (lacking "existing vocabulary"). This leads to "dealing with invalidation" from family, friends, and doctors. There is a "valid concern about being pathologized or diagnosed with a mental illness" , which causes feelings of "alienation, isolation, or depression".  
* **Integrating New Values with Earthly Expectations:** This is the central, long-term conflict. The new spiritual values are "completely inconsistent with one's life prior". This creates "friction in almost all important areas of life," often leading to "stressful emotional and financial upheaval like divorce or career changes".  
* **Unwelcome Psychic/Physical Sensitivities:** The profile often includes "problems dealing with psychic abilities" and a new, disruptive "heightened sensitivity to electricity, chemicals, smells, loud noises".

### **5.3 Helpful vs. Unhelpful Integration Modalities**

The data on how these individuals cope provides critical, non-speculative insight into their lived experience.

* **Not Reported to be Helpful:** A key finding is that "psychiatric care and medication were usually not reported to be helpful". This reinforces the non-pathological nature of the experience and the inadequacy of a purely materialistic framework to integrate it.  
* **Reported as Helpful/Essential:** The practices that experiencers find essential for integration are introspective and spiritual: "practicing compassion, forgiveness, gratitude, and self-awareness"; "exploring the unconscious"; "finding serene environments"; and "reading spiritual literature, praying, and sharing with another person".

These "Common Challenges Following an STE" are not a new, separate problem. They are the predictable, long-term *externalization* of the "Crucible of Crisis" (Stage 2). The "Crucible" is the *internal* conflict between the Soul's compass and the Ego. The "Intervention" resolves this internal battle by shattering the old ego. However, the individual must now live this new, transformed, mission-based identity in an *external* world that is still aligned with the *old* framework. The battle shifts from *internal* (Soul vs. Ego) to *external* (Called-Soul vs. The World). This adds a crucial, data-backed "post-call" stage to the Volunteer Soul's journey, making the profile far more substantial and true to the lived experience.

## **VI. Conclusion: A Synthesized, Multi-Layered Profile of the Volunteer Soul**

This analysis has constructed a substantial, high-confidence profile of the Volunteer Soul Incarnation, grounded in the core cosmological framework of "The Threefold Path of the Soul" and expanded with corroborating phenomenological, psychological, and theological data.  
The profile is not one of a random, gifted, or pathological individual, but of a consciousness on a specific, purposeful journey.

1. **The Foundation:** The profile begins with a *pre-incarnate choice* for a *mission of collective service* , distinguishing it from normative (developmental) and restorative (healing) incarnations.  
2. **The Activation:** This mission lies latent until activated by a "Revelatory Intervention" (the "Call"). This activation is a four-stage, psycho-theological process: a "Preparatory Longing" (Stage 1\) builds into a "Crucible of Crisis" (Stage 2), which is resolved by the "Intervention" (Stage 3), culminating in a "Realization of Providence" (Stage 4\) that reframes the individual's entire life story.  
3. **The Expansion:** This report successfully moved beyond the "biased" NDE data, demonstrating that this "Revelatory Intervention" is a standalone, non-pathological phenomenon that also occurs as Spontaneous Spiritual Awakenings and "Near-Death-Like" experiences in healthy individuals.  
4. **The Validation:** The profile is validated by academic psychology. The "Longing" (Stage 1\) maps to an empirical profile high in "Openness" and "Spirituality". The "Mission" (Purpose) maps to the "Sense of Mission" profile and is driven by an altruism explicitly defined as a "calling". The "Realization" (Stage 4\) is identified as the *mechanism* for forging the "coherent narrative identity" that empirically underpins a life of purpose.  
5. **The Lived Experience:** The "substantial" profile of the post-call individual is one of permanent transformation , defined by a mission that often requires "emotional as well as material sacrifice". This life is characterized by predictable and profound integration challenges as the individual's internal "Crucible of Crisis" becomes an externalized friction against a world that does not share their new paradigm.

Ultimately, this synthesized model reframes the fundamental question from the generic "Do we reincarnate?" to the far more meaningful and personal inquiry: "What is the purpose and nature of *this particular* incarnation?".
