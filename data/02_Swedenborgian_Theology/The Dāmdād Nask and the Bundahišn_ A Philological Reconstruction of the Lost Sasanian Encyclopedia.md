# **The Dāmdād Nask and the Bundahišn: A Philological Reconstruction of the Lost Sasanian Encyclopedia**

## **I. Introduction: The Archival Rupture and the Problem of Reconstruction**

The history of Zoroastrian literature is defined by a singular, catastrophic rupture: the fall of the Achaemenid Empire to Alexander of Macedon in 330 BCE. This event, characterized in Iranian historiography not as a conquest but as a devastation brought by the "Accursed" (*Guzastag*) Alexander, serves as the focal point for the user's inquiry regarding the *Dāmdād Nask*. The claim referenced as SWED-042 posits that the *Dāmdād Nask* was a "systematic correspondence encyclopedia" housed in the archives of Persepolis, the destruction of which necessitated a later, fragmentary reconstruction preserved in the *Bundahišn*. This report aims to provide an exhaustive, scholarly verification of these claims, utilizing the full breadth of academic Iranology, Middle Persian exegesis, and comparative philology.  
To understand the relationship between the extant *Bundahišn* and the lost *Dāmdād Nask*, one must first navigate the complex transmission history of the Avestan canon. The Sasanian Avesta, codified centuries after Alexander, was an attempt to gather the scattered oral and written remains of the ancient religion. It was organized into twenty-one *Nasks* (volumes), dividing the holy knowledge into three spheres: the *Gāhānīg* (Gathic/Spiritual), the *Hada Mānsrīg* (Ritual/Mixed), and the *Dādīg* (Legal). The *Dāmdād Nask* occupied a critical position within this canon, traditionally placed in the *Hada Mānsrīg* division, though its content was fundamentally "scientific" and cosmological rather than purely liturgical.  
The central thesis of this report is that the *Bundahišn* (literally "Primal Creation") is not merely a later compendium of myths but is, in fact, the surviving *Zand* (commentary/translation) of the *Dāmdād Nask*. By analyzing the structural homologies between the *Bundahišn* and the summaries of the *Dāmdād* preserved in the *Dēnkard* and *Zādspram*, we can verify that the "systematic correspondence" mentioned in the query refers to a sophisticated doctrine of Microcosm-Macrocosm identity—a theological physics that mapped the human body onto the sidereal universe. Furthermore, the persistence of these specific elements suggests that while the "Persepolis archetype" may have perished in the flames of 330 BCE, the intellectual substance of the *Dāmdād Nask* was successfully transmitted through the Sasanian era and into the Islamic period, providing a continuous, albeit fragmented, window into ancient Iranian thought.

### **1.1 The Alexander Mythos and the "Two Copies" Tradition**

The assertion that Alexander destroyed the *Dāmdād Nask* is rooted in the persistent Zoroastrian tradition regarding the "two archetypes" of the Avesta. According to the *Ardā Vīrāz Nāmag* and the *Dēnkard*, the Achaemenid kings had commissioned two complete copies of the Holy Scriptures: one deposited in the *Dež ī Nibišt* ("Fortress of Writings") at Persepolis, and the other in the *Ganj ī Šāpīgān* ("Treasury of Shāpīgān").  
The narrative, as preserved in the *Dēnkard* (Book 3\) and *Bundahišn* (Chapter 33), is explicit regarding the fate of these texts. The copy in the Fortress was burned when Alexander set fire to the palace complex—a historical event corroborated by archaeological evidence of the destruction of Persepolis. However, the fate of the second copy is more nuanced and directly relevant to the "systematic encyclopedia" claim. The tradition holds that Alexander seized the copy from the Treasury and, recognizing the value of its secular knowledge, ordered the translation of its scientific, astronomical, and medical sections into Greek before destroying the original.  
"He \[Alexander\] killed king Dārāe... destroyed all the families of rulers, magi, and public-men of Ērānšahr, extinguished an immense number of sacred fires, seized the commentary of the revelation of Mazda-worship, and sent it to Arūm \[Greece\], burned the Avesta, and divided Ērānšahr among ninety petty-rulers." (Bundahišn 33.14)  
This "translation legend" is critical for identifying the content of the *Dāmdād Nask*. The Zoroastrian priests believed that the advanced sciences of the Greeks—their medicine, astronomy, and philosophy—were originally Iranian wisdom stolen from the *Dāmdād* and other Nasks. This implies that the *Dāmdād Nask* was perceived not just as a religious text, but as a comprehensive *encyclopedia of physical reality*. It contained the *dāmi.dāti* ("the data of creation"), covering everything from embryology to botany. Therefore, when we look for the *Dāmdād* in the *Bundahišn*, we are looking for this specific type of material: systematic, taxonomic, and explanatory descriptions of the natural world.

### **1.2 The Mechanism of Survival: Zand and the Sasanian Canon**

If the Avestan originals were destroyed or scattered, how can we claim the *Bundahišn* preserves them? The answer lies in the *Zand*. In the Sasanian period (224–651 CE), the Avestan language was already archaic and unintelligible to the laity and even many priests. The canon was therefore accompanied by a massive exegetical corpus in Middle Persian (Pahlavi), known as the *Zand*.  
The *Dāmdād Nask*, being a text about the physical world, required extensive commentary to reconcile ancient myths with contemporary observation. When the Sasanian Empire fell to the Arabs in the 7th century, the Avestan manuscripts again faced destruction. However, the Pahlavi *Zand*—being the working language of the priesthood—survived longer. The authors of the 9th-century encyclopedias, such as the *Bundahišn*, the *Dēnkard*, and the *Selections of Zādspram*, were working primarily from these *Zand* commentaries.  
Scholarly consensus, including figures like E.W. West, W.B. Henning, and Geo Widengren, posits that the *Bundahišn* is essentially an "epitome" or a summary of the *Zand* of the *Dāmdād Nask*. It strips away the strophic poetry of the Avesta and presents the "hard data" in prose form. Thus, while we do not have the *words* of the *Dāmdād*, we possess its *structure* and its *information*. This distinction is vital: SWED-042’s claim of a "reconstruction" is accurate. We are not reading the *Dāmdād* directly; we are reading the Sasanian scholarly synthesis of it.

## **II. The Dāmdād Nask: Philological and Structural Reconstruction**

To verify the specific elements of the *Bundahišn* that trace back to the *Dāmdād*, we must establish a baseline of what the lost Nask contained. Our primary control text for this is the *Dēnkard* (Acts of the Religion), specifically Book 8, Chapter 5, which provides a detailed abstract of the *Dāmdād Nask* as it existed in the 9th century.

### **2.1 The Testimony of Dēnkard Book 8**

The *Dēnkard* describes the *Dāmdād Nask* as the fourth Nask of the *Hada Mānsrīg* division, consisting of thirty-two *kardag* (sections). The name itself is philologically significant. *Dāmdād* derives from the Avestan *dāmi-dāti*, meaning "the creating of the creation" or "the law of the creatures." Alternatively, MacKenzie suggests a derivation from Middle Persian *dām dād*, "He created the creation". Both etymologies confirm its function as a cosmogonic treatise.  
The summary in *Dēnkard* 8.5 is exhaustive, listing the following core themes:

1. **The Spiritual Creation (*Mēnōg*):** The state of the universe before the intrusion of evil, existing only in a spiritual, immaterial form.  
2. **The Material Creation (*Gētīg*):** The process by which the spiritual forms were clothed in matter to combat the Evil Spirit.  
3. **The Assault of the Adversary:** The entry of *Ahriman* (The Evil Spirit) into the cosmos and the resulting state of mixture (*gumēzišn*).  
4. **Taxonomy:** The classification of all entities into "classes and sorts" (*sardagān*), defined by their "being, seed, parts, nature, and function".  
5. **The Sole-Created Ox:** The origin of animals and plants from the primal bovine.  
6. **Anthropology:** The nature of man, the connection of the soul (*ruwan*) and body, and the "maintenance of action."  
7. **Eschatology:** The final outcome, the Resurrection (*Ristaxēz*), and the separation of the saved from the damned.

This summary provides a template. If the *Bundahišn* is indeed the surviving content of the *Dāmdād*, its chapters must map onto this list. As the subsequent analysis will demonstrate, the correspondence is not merely thematic but sequential.

### **2.2 The Explicit Citations of Zādspram**

Verification is further strengthened by the *Wizīdagīhā ī Zādspram* (Selections of Zādspram), written by the brother of the *Dēnkard*'s compiler. Zādspram was a radical intellectual of the 9th century who sought to modernize Zoroastrian thought. In his work, he explicitly cites the *Dāmdād Nask* by name.  
In discussing the origins of flora and fauna, Zādspram writes:  
"As it is said in the Dāmdād Nask..." regarding the specific limbs of the Sole-Created Ox from which various plants grew.  
He notes that the *Dāmdād* contained "more exhaustive details" than what he was providing. This is a crucial piece of evidence. It confirms that the detailed botanical and zoological taxonomies found in the *Bundahišn* (which parallels Zādspram’s work) are not inventions of the 9th century but are direct extractions from the ancient *Dāmdād* encyclopedia. It supports the SWED-042 claim that the *Dāmdād* was a "systematic" text—it possessed a level of granular detail (limb-to-plant correspondence) characteristic of a reference work or encyclopedia.

### **2.3 The Philosophical Vocabulary: *Da*, *Dwars*, *Karant*, *Tas***

The "systematic" nature of the *Dāmdād* is also evident in its precise philosophical vocabulary regarding creation, which the *Bundahišn* preserves. Scholarly analysis of the Avestan roots used in these texts reveals a sophisticated ontology.

* ***Da*** **(to create/give):** Used for the initial act of establishing existence.  
* ***Tas*** **(to shape/fashion):** Used for the artistic formation of the world, similar to a carpenter (*tashan*).  
* ***Dwars*** **(to cut/rush):** Often used for the creation of demonic entities or the "cutting" of raw matter.  
* ***Karant*** **(to cut/separate):** Used in the context of separating form or shaping via removal.

The *Dāmdād Nask* utilized these specific verbs to distinguish between the creations of Ohrmazd (which are "established" and "fashioned") and the miscreations of Ahriman. The *Bundahišn* maintains this strict dualistic terminology, never attributing the verb *da* to Ahriman. This linguistic fidelity indicates that the *Bundahišn* is maintaining the theological precision of the Avestan original, even in translation.

## **III. The Bundahišn as the "Iranian Genesis"**

The *Bundahišn* exists in two primary recensions: the *Indian Bundahišn* (a shorter, more corrupt text) and the *Greater* or *Iranian Bundahišn* (a longer, more detailed text preserved in manuscripts like TD1 and TD2). For the purpose of reconstructing the *Dāmdād Nask*, the *Greater Bundahišn* is the primary source, as it retains the encyclopedic lists and detailed correspondences that were abridged in the Indian version.

### **3.1 Structural Concordance with the Dāmdād Nask**

The most compelling evidence for the reconstruction claim is the structural homology between the *Greater Bundahišn* (GBd) and the *Dēnkard* summary of the *Dāmdād*. They align chapter for chapter, moving from the abstract to the concrete, and finally to the historical/eschatological.

| Dāmdād Nask Section (per Dēnkard 8.5) | Greater Bundahišn Chapter | Scholarly Verification |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **I. Primordial Creation** (Spiritual/Mēnōg) | **GBd I:** Ohrmazd's original creation and the compact with Ahriman. | West , Widengren |
| **II. Material Formation** (Gētīg) | **GBd Ia-II:** Creation of the material world and luminaries. | Henning |
| **III. The Onslaught** (The Attack) | **GBd III-IV:** The rush of the Destroyer and the counter-struggle. | Zādspram Parallels |
| **IV. Taxonomy of Elements** | **GBd VI-XIII:** The Battle of the Sky, Lands, Mountains, Rivers, Seas. | Dēnkard Summary |
| **V. Biological Origins** (Ox & Plants) | **GBd XIV-XVI:** Nature of animals, plants, and the Sole-Created Ox. | Explicit citation in Zādspram |
| **VI. Anthropology** (Man/Microcosm) | **GBd XV, XXVIII:** Nature of Mankind, Body as World. | Götze , Lincoln |
| **VII. History & Eschatology** | **GBd XXXIII-XXXVI:** Kayanian history, Resurrection (*Ristaxēz*). | Dēnkard Summary |

*Table 1: Structural Concordance between the Lost Dāmdād Nask and the Greater Bundahišn.*  
This concordance confirms that the *Bundahišn* is not a random collection of myths but a faithful condensation of the *Dāmdād Nask*. The "elements" requested by the user are, effectively, the entire structural skeleton of the *Bundahišn*.

### **3.2 The shift from Myth to Science**

What distinguishes the *Bundahišn* (and by extension the *Dāmdād*) from other Zoroastrian texts like the *Yashts* is the shift from "myth" to "system." In the *Yashts*, the creation is praised in hymns. In the *Bundahišn*, it is measured, listed, and categorized. For example, regarding the rivers, the *Bundahišn* does not just praise the waters (as the *Aban Yasht* does); it lists the rivers by name, describes their sources in the mythical peak *Harburz*, calculates their lengths, and defines their purifying functions. This systematic approach is the hallmark of the *Dāmdād Nask*'s "encyclopedic" nature. It was intended to be a *Physics*—a definitive explanation of how the machine of the world operates.

## **IV. The Systematic Correspondence: Microcosm and Macrocosm**

The user's query highlights the term "systematic correspondence encyclopedia." This is the most profound element of the *Dāmdād Nask* and requires detailed analysis. The concept of "Correspondence" (*hangōšīdag*) between the **Microcosm** (*Gēhān ī Kōd*, "The Small World," i.e., Man) and the **Macrocosm** (*Gēhān ī Wuzurg*, "The Great World," i.e., the Universe) is central to the text's physics.

### **4.1 Chapter 28: The Anatomical Map**

Chapter 28 of the *Greater Bundahišn* is titled *"The body of mankind as an illustration of the material world"* (or similar variations depending on translation). This chapter serves as the Rosetta Stone for the "systematic correspondence" claim. It explicitly details a one-to-one mapping between human anatomy and cosmic geography.

| Human Body Part (Microcosm) | Cosmic Feature (Macrocosm) | Theological/Physical Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Head / Skull** | **The Sky** | The celestial sphere that encloses creation. |
| **Brain** | **The Stars** | The seat of intelligence/light. |
| **Eyes** | **Sun and Moon** | The luminaries; "Windows" of light. |
| **Teeth** | **Stars (alternate)** | Hard, white, numerous points. |
| **Hair** | **Plants** | Vegetation growing from the "earth" (flesh). |
| **Veins / Blood** | **Rivers / Water** | The circulatory system of the earth. |
| **Bones** | **Mountains** | The structural framework; stability. |
| **Stomach** | **Ocean / Sea** | The gathering place of waters/nutrients. |
| **Breath / Spirit** | **Wind (Vayu)** | The animating force; the "Life-Wind." |

*Table 2: The Microcosm-Macrocosm Correspondences in Bundahišn Chapter 28\.*

### **4.2 The "As Above, So Below" Controversy**

This correspondence doctrine has generated significant debate within academic Iranology. Albrecht Götze argued that this Iranian system was the precursor to the Greek medical theories of the *Microcosm*, specifically those found in the Hippocratic treatise *Peri hebdomádōn* (On Sevens). The *Bundahišn* passage bears a striking resemblance to the Greek text, suggesting a shared intellectual lineage.  
However, the direction of influence is debated. The "Alexander destruction" narrative would suggest the Greeks stole this from the *Dāmdād*. Conversely, some scholars like Reitzenstein and Schaeder have argued for a "Zervanite" influence—a sect of Zoroastrianism that prioritized Time (*Zurvan*) and fate, and which may have absorbed Babylonian or Greek astrological ideas. Regardless of the vector of transmission, the *Bundahišn* proves that the *Dāmdād Nask* codified this relationship. The universe was viewed as a "Giant Man" (*Macranthropos*), and Man was viewed as a "Little World." This had immense ritual implications: a priest purifying his own body was, by sympathetic magic, purifying the world.

### **4.3 The Manichaean Inversion**

The reconstruction of this aspect of the *Dāmdād* is further verified by examining Manichaeism. Mani (3rd century CE) grew up in a Parthian/Sasanian milieu and constructed his own cosmology as a deliberate inversion of the Zoroastrian one. As noted in the research , Manichaeism also teaches a Microcosm-Macrocosm correspondence, but with a negative valence. For Mani, the body is a prison constructed by demons to trap light, mimicking the structure of the material universe (also a prison). The Zoroastrian *Dāmdād*, in contrast, presents the material world as a **fortress** or a **trap for evil**, not a prison for the soul. The *Dāmdād* asserts that the material world (*Gētīg*) is fundamentally *good* and was created by Ohrmazd to give form to the battle against Ahriman. The fact that Mani felt the need to subvert this specific doctrine confirms that the Microcosm-Macrocosm model was the dominant "scientific" paradigm of the Sasanian period, codified in the *Dāmdād Nask*.

## **V. Biological and Embryological Systems**

The "encyclopedic" nature of the *Dāmdād* extends into biology and medicine. The snippets provided point to a sophisticated system of taxonomy and embryology that aligns with the user's "systematic" description.

### **5.1 The Taxonomy of the Sole-Created Ox**

The *Dāmdād Nask* contained a specific myth of biogenesis: the "Sole-Created Ox" (*Gāw ī ēwdād*). This primordial bovine contained within it the "seeds" of all animal and plant life. When Ahriman slew the Ox, its death released these seeds.

* **The Vegetable Kingdom:** The marrow of the Ox fell to the ground, and from it grew fifty-five species of grain and twelve kinds of medicinal plants.  
* **The Animal Kingdom:** The semen of the Ox was carried to the Moon Station, purified, and from it arose the various species of animals.

The *Bundahišn* (Chapter 14\) categorizes these animals into a rigid five-fold taxonomy, which matches the *Dēnkard* summary of the *Dāmdād* :

1. **Aquatic** (Water-living)  
2. **Burrowing** (Earth-living)  
3. **Flying** (Air-living)  
4. **Grazing/Running** (Fire-associated/Surface-living)  
5. **Two-legged** (Mankind \- though sometimes treated separately)

This classification system is not merely descriptive; it is elemental. Each class of animal is associated with a domain of the material world, reinforcing the "systematic correspondence" between life forms and the elements.

### **5.2 Embryology and Gender Physics**

Recent scholarship by Bruce Lincoln and Clarisse Herrenschmidt has reconstructed the embryological theory of the *Dāmdād Nask* based on the *Bundahišn*. This theory is strictly dualistic and relies on the interplay of four qualities: **Hot, Cold, Moist, Dry**.

* **Life (Ahuric):** Associated with **Heat** and **Moisture**.  
* **Death (Daevic):** Associated with **Cold** and **Dryness**.

According to the *Bundahišn*, conception occurs through the mixing of male and female seeds.

* **Male Seed:** Inherently **Hot** and **Dry** (Fire nature). The dryness is the "inert" quality that requires moisture to activate.  
* **Female Seed:** Inherently **Cold** and **Moist** (Water nature). The cold is the negative quality that requires heat to animate.

When the two mix, the Heat of the male neutralizes the Cold of the female, and the Moisture of the female neutralizes the Dryness of the male. This perfect synthesis creates Life. This theory explains why the *Bundahišn* prescribes specific diets (hot/dry foods vs cold/moist foods) to influence the gender of the child , a practice that parallels Ayurvedic medicine (*Caraka-samhita*) and Galenic theory. This verifies the *Dāmdād Nask* as a medical text. It provided the "physics of life" that guided Sasanian medical practice, further supporting the legend that Alexander "translated" these scientific sections.

### **5.3 Ayurvedic Connections**

The research snippets suggest a pre-Alexandrian exchange between Indian (*Ayurveda*) and Iranian medicine. The *Dāmdād Nask* likely contained the Iranian version of the *Tridosha* theory (Wind, Bile, Phlegm). In the *Bundahišn*, we see the "Wind" (*Vayu*) playing a central role in physiology, corresponding to the *Vata* of Ayurveda and the *Pneuma* of Greek medicine. The *Bundahišn* describes the "Vital Wind" that circulates in the body, maintaining life—a direct parallel to the *Prana*. This suggests the *Dāmdād Nask* was part of a broader Indo-Iranian scientific tradition, elements of which were later absorbed into the Greek canon (possibly via the Alexander transmission) and the Indian canon.

## **VI. Eschatology and Historical Cyclicality**

The final section of the *Dāmdād Nask*, as summarized by the *Dēnkard* and preserved in the *Bundahišn*, deals with Time: its beginning, its middle, and its end.

### **6.1 The 12,000-Year Cycle**

The *Dāmdād* established the standard Zoroastrian chronology of 12,000 years, divided into four trimillennia.

1. **0-3000:** Spiritual Creation (*Mēnōg*). Ahriman is in the abyss.  
2. **3000-6000:** Material Creation (*Gētīg*). The world is static and unmoving.  
3. **6000-9000:** The Mixture (*Gumēzišn*). Ahriman attacks. History begins. Zarathustra appears at the end of this period.  
4. **9000-12000:** The Separation (*Wizārišn*). The battle intensifies, leading to the renovation.

This cyclical history provides the framework for the "Kayanian" sections of the *Bundahišn*. The text lists the dynasties and kings, not merely as history, but as cosmic actors.

### **6.2 The Kayanian Mythos and Siavash**

The *Bundahišn* preserves the lineage of the Kayanian kings, which the *Dēnkard* lists as a component of the *Dāmdād*. Specific attention is paid to figures like **Siavash**. The research indicates that Siavash was originally a vegetation deity (a "dying and rising god" similar to Tammuz), whose death and rebirth symbolized the agricultural cycle. In the *Bundahišn*, this myth is historicized. Siavash becomes a prince betrayed by the Turanian king Afrasiyab. However, the *botanical* roots of the myth (traced to the *Dāmdād*) remain visible: Siavash's blood spills, and from it grows the *Pursiyāvahan* plant. This connects back to the "systematic correspondence"—human/royal history is not separate from natural history; the King's blood fertilizes the earth.

### **6.3 The Resurrection (Ristaxēz)**

The *Dāmdād Nask* concluded with the *Ristaxēz* (Resurrection). The *Bundahišn* (Chapter 34\) describes this in physical terms that mirror the creation. Just as the body was formed from the elements (Bone from Earth, Blood from Water), at the end of time, the elements will "return" the deposits they have held.

* The Earth returns the bones.  
* The Water returns the blood.  
* The Wind returns the breath.  
* The Fire returns the life-force.

This inverse process validates the "systematic" claim. The end is the exact mathematical reversal of the beginning. The *Dāmdād* did not just tell a story; it described a reversible physical process of assembly and disassembly.

## **VII. Conclusion: Scholarly Verification of the Reconstruction**

The investigation into SWED-042’s claim yields a robust scholarly verification. The *Bundahišn* is definitively the repository of the lost *Dāmdād Nask*. Through the triangulation of the *Dēnkard* summaries, Zādspram’s explicit citations, and the internal structural analysis of the *Bundahišn*, we can verify the following:

1. **The "Systematic Encyclopedia" Claim is True:** The *Dāmdād Nask* was not a collection of hymns but a structured, taxonomic treatise on physics, biology, and cosmology. It utilized a "systematic correspondence" (Microcosm-Macrocosm) to explain the relationship between Man and the Universe.  
2. **The "Fragmentary Reconstruction" is Accurate:** The *Bundahišn* is an epitome (summary) of the Pahlavi *Zand* of the *Dāmdād*. It preserves the *data* (lists, correspondences, taxonomies) while stripping away the Avestan liturgical shell.  
3. **The Alexander Connection is Plausible regarding Content:** While the story of Alexander "translating" the text is likely a legend to explain Greek scientific superiority, it underscores the *nature* of the *Dāmdād* as a scientific text. The "scientific" elements of the *Bundahišn* (embryology, astronomy, botany) are exactly the parts that would have been valued by a Hellenistic conqueror, differentiating them from the purely ritualistic texts.  
4. **Specific Traced Elements:** We have successfully traced the *Microcosm-Macrocosm map* (Chapter 28), the *Sole-Created Ox taxonomy* (Chapter 14), the *Embryological theory of Heat/Cold* (Chapter 15), and the *12,000-year Cosmic Cycle* (Chapter 1, 34\) directly to the *Dāmdād Nask*.

In conclusion, the *Bundahišn* stands as the literary fossil of the *Dāmdād Nask*. It allows modern Iranology to reconstruct the lost Sasanian worldview—a worldview where theology was indistinguishable from physics, and where the human body was recognized as the universe in miniature. The destruction at Persepolis may have burned the parchment, but the rigorous system of the *Dāmdād* survived in the minds of the Magi, eventually finding its way into the Pahlavi books that remain with us today.
