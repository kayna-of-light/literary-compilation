      A hermeneutic methodology that distinguishes the "natural plane" (body of effects)
      from the "spiritual plane" (soul of causes). Scientific/historical-critical findings
      provide accurate maps of external reality; Swedenborgian theology reveals meaning
      and causation. Neither tier negates the other; they operate on different planes.
    
    caveats:
      - "This is a hermeneutic stance, not a validated epistemology"
      - "The spiritual tier is unfalsifiable by design—no empirical finding could disprove it"
      - "Functions as interpretive lens, not integration of co-equal methods"

    title: "Q Source Hypothesis (Quelle - Sayings Source)"
    domain: BIBL
    status: validated
    confidence: medium
    
    definition: >
      A hypothetical written Greek document (c. 50-70 CE) containing approximately 230 verses of
      Jesus's sayings shared by Matthew and Luke but absent from Mark. Proposed to explain the
      'Double Tradition'—verbatim agreements between Matthew/Luke in non-Markan material
      (Beatitudes, Lord's Prayer, etc.). Q is inferred from extensive word-for-word Greek
      agreements suggesting literary copying, not oral tradition. Debate: If Q lacked passion
      narrative, it could indicate earliest Christianity focused on Jesus as wisdom teacher, not
      crucified Savior.

      An alternative solution to the Synoptic Problem that accepts Markan Priority but eliminates

      explanation for 'minor agreements' (Luke agrees with Matthew against Mark because he's
      reading Matthew's edited version). Main weakness: Why would Luke dismantle Matthew's

      A persistent challenge to the Two-Source Hypothesis: instances where Matthew and Luke agree
      in wording AGAINST Mark in Triple Tradition material (passages all three share). If Matthew
      and Luke independently edited Mark without knowledge of each other, these agreements should

      strained; Farrer Hypothesis solves the problem elegantly (Luke read Matthew).

      for early church, unlikely invention (Jesus's baptism, family's disbelief); (3) Dissimilarity

      voice. Recent criticism: Dissimilarity criterion produces distorted Jesus disconnected from

      resurrection of the earliest Jewish followers. The lineage: Proto-Luke (Jamesian) →
      Mark (Pauline Reaction) → Matthew & Canonical Luke (Harmonization). Marcion's Evangelion

      The Magi who visited the infant Jesus were the last custodians of the 'Science of
      Correspondences'—the ancient wisdom that every natural object corresponds to a
      spiritual reality. Their journey represents the final act of the 'Ancient Church,'
      passing its accumulated wisdom to the nascent Christian church. Daniel, as 'Rab-mag'
      (Chief of the Magi), had re-infused the Magian tradition with genuine prophetic spirit.
      The gifts (gold, frankincense, myrrh) formed a complete theological statement:
      celestial goodness (gold), spiritual goodness (frankincense), natural goodness (myrrh).
      Their journey represents the providential confluence of Persian (Zoroastrian) and 
      Judean (Essene/prophetic) wisdom streams.

      The archangel concept evolved from Ancient Near Eastern divine councils through

      communication/revelation (Gabriel), providence/healing (Raphael), wisdom/light (Uriel).
      Each Abrahamic tradition adapted these figures to reflect core theological concerns:
      Judaism (covenantal guardian), Christianity (Incarnation messenger), Islam (revelation

      The pivotal event in Easter 1744 when Swedenborg received his divine commission
      during a Christophany in Delft. Following months of intense spiritual crisis
      ("vastation"), he received the command "Nå så giör" (Well, then do), interpreted
      as "Do what thou hast promised." This marked his transition from scientific
      investigator to commissioned revelator. The commission was not a new directive
      but the divine sanctification of his life's quest to bridge mind and matter.

      The figure of Melchizedek generated three distinct interpretive traditions:

      and the deity Zedek, whose royal priesthood was co-opted by the Davidic monarchy;
      (2) Sectarian/Eschatological: Elevated to celestial warrior-priest and Elohim

      (3) Rabbinic Counter-Narrative: Identified as Shem son of Noah, providing
      genealogy and explaining why priesthood was transferred to Levi.

    definition: >
      A phenomenological framework positing that human history represents a progressive
      "Fall" from internal, intuitive cognition into externalized language and concepts.
      The "Golden Age" featured internal respiration (vagus-mediated), lip-speech
      (pre-verbal mimetic communication), and representative perception (natural objects
      as immediate spiritual percepts). The "Fall" was displacement to articulate
      speech, writing, and abstract concepts—an "outer layer barely capable of understanding."
      Despite this Fall, Divine Bricolage providentially guided conceptual evolution
      (from Babylon's violent myths to Israel's purified narratives) toward the
      Incarnation, where the Word became Flesh and internal-external were reunited.

    domain: EARLY

    definition: >
      The thesis that the Quranic Jesus (Isa ibn Maryam) functions as a deliberate
      theological "correction" of Pauline/Gnostic Christianity, restoring the
      Jamesian/Nazarene Christology that was marginalized by the Imperial Church.
      The Quran systematically dismantles: (1) Anti-cosmic dualism - Jesus created
      from dust, ate food (refutes Docetism); (2) Demiurge theology - "Allah is my
      Lord AND your Lord" (unifies Creator/Savior); (3) Antinomianism - Jesus "confirms
      the Torah," enjoins Prayer (Salat) and Charity (Zakat). The term "Hawariyun"
      (disciples) derives from Syriac "Pure Ones" (white-clad), matching descriptions
      of James the Just and his followers. Surah 61:14's "victory" may be fulfilled
      by the Islamic conquests dismantling the Byzantine (Pauline) Empire.
    
    caveats:

    title: "Damascus Divergence Hypothesis"
    domain: EARLY
    status: contested
    confidence: medium
    
    definition: >
      A critical scholarly analysis arguing that Paul's Damascus vision, the sole
      legitimating warrant for his apostolate, is NOT historically reliable but a
      sophisticated rhetorical/literary construct. Three converging lines of evidence:
      (1) The tripartite accounts in Acts contain irreconcilable contradictions
      (companions hearing vs. not hearing; standing vs. all falling; Ananias mediation
      vs. direct commission); (2) Paul's own phrase "en emoi" (in me, Gal 1:15-16)
      describes an INTERNAL subjective revelation, not external objective appearance,
      aligning with Gnostic epistemology of self-validating gnosis; (3) Acts 26:14's
      "kick against the goads" is a direct quotation from Euripides' Bacchae (line 795),
      suggesting Luke used Greek drama as literary template—the Pentheus/Dionysus
      theomachos archetype applied to Saul/Jesus.
    
    textual_contradictions:
      auditory: |
        Acts 9:7: Companions "heard the voice" but saw no one
        Acts 22:9: Companions "did not hear the voice" but saw light
        Result: Direct factual contradiction, not resolvable by grammar
      postural: |
        Acts 9:7: Companions "stood speechless" (eistēkeisan eneoi)
        Acts 26:14: "We had ALL fallen to the ground" (pantōn katapesontōn)
        Result: Shift heightens drama for Agrippa audience
      mediational: |
        Acts 9, 22: Paul told to go to Damascus, receive commission from Ananias
        Acts 26: Ananias completely excised; Jesus gives full commission directly
        Result: Acts 26 closer to Galatians 1:12 ("not from man")—Ananias is Lukan invention
    
    bacchae_parallels:
      verbal: |
        Acts 26:14: "It is hard for you to kick against the goads"
        Bacchae line 795: "Do not kick against the goads, a mortal against a god"
        Problem: Greek proverb from pagan play placed in mouth of Semitic Jesus
        speaking "in the Hebrew language"—historical implausibility
      structural:
        - "Theomachos archetype: persecutor (Pentheus/Saul) fights unrecognized deity"
        - "Imprisonment: Dionysus and Paul/Silas both imprisoned"
        - "Earthquake: Opens prison in both Bacchae (585) and Acts 16:26"
        - "Epiphany: Divine light/voice commanding cessation of persecution"
      conclusion: |
        Acts author crafted foundational myth using Euripidean template,
        casting Paul as "reformed Pentheus"—historical fiction for legitimation
    
    epistemological_critique:
      en_emoi_significance: |
        Paul: "to reveal his Son IN ME (en emoi)" - radically interior event
        Traditional gloss: "to me" - external appearance
        Critical reading: Internal revelation aligns with Gnostic epistemology
        where truth accessed through pneumatic self, not external witness
      bypass_function: |
        Interior revelation renders authority unassailable by external critique
        Negates need for verification by Jerusalem apostles who knew earthly Jesus
        Self-validating gnosis replaces historical transmission
    
    arabia_lacuna:
      galatians_claim: |
        Paul: "did not go up to Jerusalem... went away into Arabia, returned to Damascus"
        (Gal 1:17) - up to 3 years before seeing Peter
      acts_narrative: |
        Arabia completely absent; Paul preaches immediately in Damascus synagogues
        then moves to Jerusalem shortly (Acts 9:20-26)
      significance: |
        Acts compresses timeline to create false continuity with Jerusalem
        Paul's independence becomes subordination in Lukan redaction
    
    aretas_problem:
      pauline_claim: "ethnarch under King Aretas guarded the city (2 Cor 11:32)"
      acts_claim: "Jews plotting at gates (Acts 9:23-25) - blame shifted"
      historical_issue: |
        No numismatic or epigraphic evidence Aretas IV controlled Damascus
        Damascus was Roman provincial capital—"ethnarch guarding city" implausible
        Leads to "symbolic Damascus" hypothesis
    
    symbolic_damascus_hypothesis:
      evidence: |
        Damascus Document (CD) from Qumran: "New Covenant in the Land of Damascus"
        Scholars (Eisenman): "Damascus" = sectarian code for Qumran/wilderness
        Based on Amos 5:27 exegesis: exile "beyond Damascus" = retreat to wilderness
      implication: |
        Paul's "return to Damascus" (Gal 1:17) may = return to sectarian base
        Resolves High Priest jurisdiction problem: no authority in Syria,
        but jurisdiction over Jews in Judean wilderness (symbolic Damascus)
    
    caveats:

      where truth comes from within, not from historical transmission. The Bacchae
      parallels suggest Luke created a Hellenistic foundational myth rather than
      recording history. Most provocatively: if 'Damascus' = Qumran code, Paul may
      be the 'Spouter of Lies' denounced in Dead Sea Scrolls for leading community
      astray. The framework reading: Paul's 'Cosmic Christ' displaced the historical
      Jesus movement, and Acts later 'domesticated' even this radical Paul for
      institutional orthodoxy—two layers of displacement from original Jamesian reality."

    definition: >
      The New Church or New Jerusalem is the Fourth Church in Swedenborg's dispensational
      schema, established after the Last Judgment of 1757. Unlike prior churches which
      ended in vastation, the New Jerusalem is founded on: (1) Acknowledgment of the Lord
      alone as God of heaven and earth; (2) Life according to the Decalogue (repentance).
      Daniel's statue (gold/silver/brass/iron-clay) represents successive churches from
      Most Ancient to Christian, all intrinsically linked. The "stone cut without hands"
      that shatters the image represents Divine Truth (the Lord) destroying external
      falsified notions to form a new foundation. The "Gentiles" among whom it is established
      are defined by internal state (good of love, affection for truth) not geography -
      those who reject the former church's external teachings and are receptive to
      revealed internal truth.

      The Exodus narrative is a masterpiece of mythic bricolage—a "redacted memory" forged
      by Iron Age scribes from three authentic but chronologically and causally disconnected
      historical fragments: (1) Memory of Cataclysm: The plagues correspond to the Thera
      volcanic eruption (c. 1600 BCE), validated by geomythology and physical evidence
      (Thera pumice at Tell el-Dab'a in Goshen); (2) Memory of Deliverance: The parting
      of the Sea of Reeds corresponds to the oceanographic phenomenon of wind setdown in
      the Nile Delta, validated by Carl Drews' computer modeling; (3) Memory of Liberation:
      The freedom theme reflects the Late Bronze Age Collapse (c. 1200 BCE) when Egyptian
      withdrawal from Canaan liberated Shasu and 'Apiru groups. Scribal bricoleurs "rotated"
      these memories into a linear cause-and-effect narrative serving as Israel's charter myth.

      The Astronomical Book (1 Enoch 72-82), likely the oldest stratum of the Enochic
      corpus (late 4th-3rd century BCE), presents a divinely revealed 364-day solar
      calendar as the sole legitimate basis for determining sacred times. Revealed by
      angel Uriel to Enoch, the calendar features: 4 seasons of exactly 91 days each
      (30+30+31 pattern), perfect divisibility by 7 (52 weeks), ensuring dates always
      fall on the same weekday. Cosmos is geocentric with sun/moon traversing 6 celestial
      "gates" east and west. Though empirically inaccurate (drifts ~1.24 days/year),
      the calendar's "truth" was ideological—reflecting divine order and mathematical
      symmetry over observational accuracy. Adopted by Qumran community as identity marker.
    
    caveats:
      - "364-day year produces seasonal drift without intercalation"
      - "Enoch offers no correction mechanism; later Qumran texts attempt reconciliation"
      - "Calendar served theological/political function, not scientific accuracy"

    domain: MYTH
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A comparative analysis of Genesis 1 and the Enuma Elish reveals two fundamentally
      different cosmological principles emerging from a shared ANE primordial matrix:
      The "Heart of Division" (Enuma Elish) posits creation through divine conflict
      (theomachy), where the cosmos is the dismembered corpse of Tiamat and humans are
      slaves made from the rebel god Kingu's blood. The "Heart of Unity" (Genesis 1)
      presents creation through effortless divine fiat, a radical Creator/creation
      distinction (no theogony), cosmos as intrinsically "good," and humans as the image
      of God with stewardship mandate. Genesis performs deliberate demythologization—
      using cognate term 'tehom' (cf. Tiamat) but stripping it of personality and
      divine status. This philosophical revolution is the prerequisite for both
      coherent theology and systematic science.
    
    caveats:
      - "Genesis uses but subverts ANE mythic vocabulary"
      - "Neither account is 'historically prior'—both represent crystallized traditions"

    definition: >
      The Animal Apocalypse (1 Enoch 85-90) and Zoroastrian bovine mythology share a
      striking structural homology: both place a "White Bull" at both the beginning
      and end of cosmic history. Zoroastrianism: Gavaevodata (primordial white bull,
      moon-bright) is killed by Ahriman—from his body springs all biological life;
      eschatological bull Hadhayans is sacrificed at Frashokereti (renovation) to
      produce the elixir of immortality. Enoch: Adam appears as a white bull; history
      degrades (bulls → sheep); Messiah appears as an eschatological white bull who
      restores all creatures to their bovine state. The link is likely genetic (Persian
      period influence) but involves theological subversion: Enoch's messiah-bull
      LIVES (no sacrifice), demonstrating Jewish rejection of Persian sacrificial
      mechanism in favor of transformational presence.

    domain: CONSC
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      Iain McGilchrist's neuro-philosophical model posits that the brain's two hemispheres
      attend to reality in fundamentally different ways, creating two distinct ontologies.
      The Right Hemisphere ("Master") perceives the world holistically: broad attention,
      context-dependent, relational, embodied, empathic, and aware of its limitations.
      The Left Hemisphere ("Emissary") operates analytically: narrow focus, decontextualized,
      utilitarian, abstract, and prone to mistaking its map for the territory (confabulation).
      When the Emissary usurps the Master's role, the result is greed, fear, ego-centrism,
      materialism, and the "meaning crisis." Neuroplasticity allows intentional attention
      (contemplative practices) to restore integration. The model aligns with process
      philosophy (Whitehead), implicate order (Bohm), and participatory universe (Wheeler).
    
    caveats:
      - "Hemispheric lateralization is relative, not absolute"
      - "McGilchrist's framework is interpretive/philosophical, not purely neuroscientific"

      from internal, intuitive perception to external, conceptual understanding. The primordial
      state ("Golden Age") featured: (1) Internal respiration linked to vagus nerve
      stimulation enabling direct spiritual perception; (2) "Lip-speech" (facial mimetic
      communication) providing immediate empathic connection; (3) "Representative Language"
      (perceiving spiritual meaning in natural objects). The Fall into articulate speech
      and writing displaced understanding to an "outer layer barely capable of understanding"—
      creating a gap between signifier and signified where the "lie" becomes possible.
      This cognitive architecture explains why concepts are inherently "false" (limited,
      displaced from living reality).
    
    caveats:
      - "Paleolithic cognitive architecture is largely speculative reconstruction"
      - "Swedenborg's 'internal respiration' concept lacks direct scientific validation"
      - "Risk of romanticizing pre-literate societies"

    definition: >
      A theological-phenomenological model synthesizing HCM scholarship, Swedenborgian
      theology, and NDE research to profile the "Actual Jesus of Love." The "Historical
      Jesus" (E.P. Sanders' "bedrock facts") is not opposed to the "Christ of Faith"
      but serves as the necessary external "vessel" (ultimate) for Divine Influx. Jesus's
      life was a process of "Glorification"—the progressive union of finite human nature
      (from Mary) with infinite Divine nature (from Jehovah)—achieved through systematic
      conquest of the proprium in temptation. Two alternating states: Exinanition (emptying,
      human consciousness, separation from Father) and Glorification (union, Divine
      consciousness, "I and the Father are one"). The result is a new ontological category:
      the "Divine Human" with a "Divine Natural" body—neither pure spirit nor finite flesh
      but the bridge between Infinite and Finite.

    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A phenomenological model resolving the "pure identification vs. cultural construct"
      debate in NDE research. The identification of Jesus in NDEs is neither cultural
      projection nor mere iconography, but a "pure identification based on a direct
      personality match." The "Being of Light" possesses a unique, consistent personality:
      unconditional love, total awareness with total acceptance, non-judgmental ("judgment
      had always been human; God only teaches"). This personality is a perfect correspondence
      to the "Divine Human" of the Gospels. Crucially, the "Dogma Paradox" proves the
      experience is not cultural projection: the NDE-Jesus consistently delivers a message
      of universal love that supersedes and contradicts the exclusivist dogma of the
      experiencer's background.
    
    caveats:
      - "Selection bias in reported cases (unusual encounters more likely published)"

      'hellish' NDE was judgment on 'faith alone' dogma (proprium), not contradiction

    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A systematic analysis of how the "Path of Gnosis" consistently dismantles the
      "Divine Human" correspondence through two primary tactics: (1) Splitting the
      Identity—separating the human "Jesus" from an impersonal "Christ" principle
      (Valentinian Gnosticism, Theosophy, Urantia Book, ACIM, Law of One); (2) Changing
      the Name—replacing "Jesus Christ" with alternative identifications ("Sananda,"
      "Jmmanuel," "Michael of Nebadon"). This framework is cosmologically incoherent
      ("a thousand conflicting ways") but unified in its strategic goal: preventing
      "pure identification" of the Lord in ultimates. The "Path of Affirmation" (NDE
      data) stands as the empirical counter-evidence: experiencers consistently identify
      the Being of Light as Jesus through "personality match," not cultural projection.
    
    caveats:
      - "Analysis groups diverse systems under single 'strategy'—may flatten differences"

      Swedenborg) shattered the "falsity from self-intelligence" (faith alone doctrine)
      that had suffocated the Third Church. Daniel's statue vision provides the archetypal
      narrative: Gold (Most Ancient Church, celestial love) → Silver (Ancient Church,
      charity) → Brass (Third Succeeding, obedience) → Iron/Clay (Christian Church,
      external truth mixed with self-intelligence). The "stone cut without hands" represents
      pure Divine Truth shattering human-constructed religious systems, becoming a "great
      rock filling the earth." Two essentials define the New Church: (1) acknowledging
      the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth; (2) life according to the Decalogue

    definition: >
      Swedenborg's Spiritual Diary provides a systematic pneumatological critique of the
      Pauline Epistles, asserting they categorically differ from the Word (Gospels/Prophets).
      The core claims: (1) Paul's epistles lack the "internal sense" (infinite spiritual
      correspondences in every letter) that constitutes sacred Scripture; (2) Paul's
      inspiration was "self-derived" (from proprium) rather than Divine dictation—he
      explicitly admits "I speak, not the Lord" (1 Cor 7:12); (3) The epistles were
      "permitted" as a protective buffer so that those incapable of bearing the intense
      internal sense wouldn't profane it; (4) Paul's spiritual state was characterized
      by "worldly ambition" and desire to be the "greatest introducer" into heaven. The
      elevation of Pauline doctrine over Gospel imperatives constitutes the spiritual
      cause of the church's "consummation" (end)—Faith Alone doctrine separating faith
      from charity.

      is protection, not approval. The tripartite critique (authority, soteriology,
      ecclesiology) explains the church's trajectory: apostolic opinion substituted for
      Divine dictation; faith separated from charity creating the 'Dragon'; keys of truth
      usurped by doctrinal ambition. 'Africans' and 'simple good' are contrasted with
      European/Protestant theological sophistication—receptivity inverse to doctrinal
      elaboration. Framework note: This is Swedenborg's most controversial material;
      presented as datum, not mandate."

    title: "NDE Multi-Axial Phenomenological Framework"
    domain: CONSC
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A comprehensive methodological framework for classifying and analyzing near-death
      experiences across four independent dimensions. Developed using phenomenological
      bracketing (epoché) to describe NDE components without metaphysical commitment.
      The framework treats NDEs as modular phenomena where each axis varies independently,
      avoiding the reductionism of single-spectrum classifications.
    
    axes:
      structural_components:
        description: "Axis I: Core phenomenological sequence"
        elements:
          - "Separation (awareness of death/dying)"
          - "Out-of-Body Experience (external observation of physical scene)"
          - "Transitional Space (tunnel, void, passage)"
          - "Unearthly Environment (realm of hyper-reality)"
          - "Life Review (empathetic perspective shift)"
          - "Boundary/Point of No Return"
          - "Return (often involuntary)"
      affective_valence:
        description: "Axis II: Emotional quality spectrum"
        scale: "Ecstatic → Deeply Peaceful → Neutral → Anxious/Fearful → Terrifying"
        note: "Not correlated with moral status; devout may have distressing, irreligious may have ecstatic"
      interactive_dimension:
        description: "Axis III: Encounter depth levels"
        levels:
          - "Level 0: No encounter"
          - "Level 1: Presence sensed (unspecified)"
          - "Level 2: Being(s) encountered (deceased relatives, light beings)"
          - "Level 3: Supreme Being/Source encountered"
      gnostic_content:
        description: "Axis IV: Knowledge acquisition levels"
        levels:
          - "Level 0: No special knowledge"
          - "Level 1: Personal knowledge (life mission, family information)"
          - "Level 2: Universal knowledge (cosmic laws, love-centrality)"
          - "Level 3: Absolute knowledge ('knowing everything' episodes, usually forgotten)"
    
    methodological_principles:
      - "Phenomenological bracketing (epoché): suspend metaphysical judgment"
      - "First-person descriptions as primary data"
      - "Structural analysis independent of ontological claims"
      - "Modular framework: each axis independently variable"
    
    key_findings:
      life_review: >
        Functions as "phenomenological engine of ethics"—experiencers relive events
        from the perspective of those they affected, generating irreversible empathetic
        transformation. Not punishment but education through direct felt experience.
      hyper_reality: >
        NDE environments consistently described as "more real than real"—challenges
        assumption that vivid = hallucinatory. Suggests access to realm with greater,
        not diminished, phenomenal intensity.
      return_mechanism: >
        Often involuntary and associated with mission/purpose ("sent back"). Suggests
        agency external to experiencer controlling transition.
    
    caveats:
      - "Framework is descriptive, not explanatory—makes no ontological claims"

      The 'hyper-reality' finding is particularly significant—if NDEs were mere
      hallucinations, we would expect diminished, not enhanced, phenomenal intensity.
      The life review as 'empathetic perspective shift' aligns directly with Swedenborgian
      doctrine that the spiritual world operates on affection, not mere intellect."

    title: "Hemispheric Integration Model (Master and Emissary)"
    domain: CONSC
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A neuro-philosophical framework derived from Iain McGilchrist's work positing
      that the brain's hemispheric division creates two fundamentally different modes
      of attending to reality. The right hemisphere ("Master") perceives the world
      holistically, relationally, and contextually—experiencing flow, presence, and
      embodied connection. The left hemisphere ("Emissary") is a powerful but subordinate
      tool that creates abstract, manipulable representations by decontextualizing and
      fragmenting experience. The relationship between these hemispheres—whether cooperative
      or usurped—determines both individual well-being and cultural trajectories.
    
    hemispheric_characteristics:
      right_hemisphere_master:
        mode: "Broad, open, vigilant attention"
        function: "Understanding, connection, meaning"
        reality: "Presence—a web of dynamic relationships"
        values: "Empathy, justice, tolerance of ambiguity"
        self_awareness: "Aware of own limitations and need for integration"
      left_hemisphere_emissary:
        mode: "Narrow, focused, target-oriented attention"
        function: "Manipulation, control, utility"
        reality: "Re-presentation—a map of static, discrete parts"
        values: "Power, certainty, efficiency"
        self_awareness: "Blind to what it doesn't know; confabulates to maintain its model"
    
    pathological_patterns:
      emissary_usurpation:
        neural: "Altered reward circuits; reduced PFC control; hyper-reactive amygdala"
        psychological: "Greed, fear, anxiety, ego-centrism, dissatisfaction, meaning crisis"
        cultural: "Materialism, standardized education, social media echo chambers, polarization"
        archetypal_myth: "Enuma Elish (creation through conflict, dismemberment, slavery)"
        philosophy: "Reductionist materialism—the map mistaken for territory"
      master_guided_integration:
        neural: "Integrated social brain; regulated prefrontal cortex; balanced amygdala"
        psychological: "Empathy, compassion, love, altruism, contentment, meaning"
        cultural: "Holistic education, community engagement, contemplative practices"
        archetypal_myth: "Genesis 1 (creation through serene ordering, unified will, 'good')"
        philosophy: "Process philosophy, holism, participatory cosmos"
    
    neuroplasticity_principle: >
      The balance between hemispheres is not fixed but actively shaped by attention
      and intention through neuroplasticity. "Neurons that fire together wire together"
      (Hebbian learning). Contemplative practices (MBSR, CCT) are "gymnasiums of the
      mind"—systematic training programs for strengthening integration pathways.
      The most fundamental choice is WHERE to place attention; this is the neurological
      basis of free will—the capacity to consciously sculpt one's own neural architecture.
    
    metaphysical_convergence:
      whitehead: "Process philosophy—reality as interconnected events, not static substances"
      bohm: "Implicate/Explicate Order—the visible world unfolds from deeper wholeness"
      wheeler: "Participatory Universe—consciousness as co-creator, not detached observer"
      synthesis: >
        "The Master's perception may be more veridical—a more accurate reflection
        of fundamental reality as described by frontier physics."
    
    framework_integration: >
      This model provides NEUROLOGICAL GROUNDING for the framework's two-tiered
      epistemology. The left hemisphere's mode = "Body" of Effects (scientific/historical-
      critical analysis). The right hemisphere's mode = "Soul" of Causes (holistic
      meaning, correspondential perception). The integrated brain = the two-tiered
      method itself—neither tier negated, both held in proper relationship.
    
    caveats:
      - "Hemispheric lateralization is relative, not absolute—both sides do most things"
      - "McGilchrist's model is contested in some neuroscience circles"
      - "Cultural critiques may overstate hemispheric causation vs. correlation"

    definition: >
      Group Near-Death Experiences (GNDEs) occur when multiple individuals undergoing
      simultaneous life-threatening trauma report sharing a single, interactive, non-physical
      experience. Distinguished from Shared-Death Experiences (SDEs) where only one
      participant is dying. GNDEs present unique evidential challenges to solipsistic
      (brain-based) NDE models, which predict private, non-interactive hallucinations.
      Analysis reveals a spectrum of inter-subjective coherence—from "interpretive reality"
      (shared stimuli, divergent identifications) to "consensual reality" (high-fidelity
      shared perception of concrete details).

    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A proposed replacement for the standard "Criterion of Embarrassment" used in
      Historical Jesus studies. The Criterion of Embarrassment assumes that narratives
      showing Jesus in weakness, subordination, or ignorance are historically authentic
      because the early church would not have invented them. This new criterion argues
      that this assumption is flawed because it presupposes a PAULINE theological baseline
      (High Christology, static perfection) as the default for earliest Christianity.
      When the JAMESIAN baseline is restored (Orthopraxy, dynamic perfection through
      struggle), these "embarrassing" moments become not accidental survivals but
      INTENTIONAL theological assertions—evidence that Jesus CONQUERED temptation,
      not that he was immune to it.

      For Jamesian orthopraxy, it is the whole point. A Christ who cannot suffer,
      cannot save. A Christ who cannot be tempted, has conquered nothing. The
      criterion shift is not merely academic—it reveals a fundamentally different
      picture of messiahship: the 'Suffering Servant' model (Isaiah 53) where
      victory comes THROUGH apparent defeat, perfection THROUGH process. This aligns
      with the Swedenborgian doctrine of Glorification where Jesus's Divine-Human
      union was achieved through progressive combat, not static endowment."

    title: "Pastoral Epistles Pseudepigraphy"
    domain: BIBL
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      The overwhelming scholarly consensus that 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus were NOT
      written by Paul but composed pseudepigraphically (c. 80-120 CE) by a later author
      invoking Pauline authority. These letters present a "domesticated Paul" who loves
      the Law, appoints bishops, insists on marriage/childbearing, and guards "sound
      doctrine" against "falsely called gnosis" (1 Tim 6:20)—contradicting the radical,
      Law-abrogating, charismatic Paul of the undisputed letters (Romans, Galatians, etc.).
    
    linguistic_evidence:
      vocabulary_shift: |
        - 848 distinct words in the Pastorals corpus
        - 306 words (36%) appear NOWHERE ELSE in Paul or NT
        - Vocabulary matches 2nd-century writers (Polycarp, Clement) not 1st-century Paul
        - Missing Pauline connective particles (gar, oun, de, ara)
      semantic_drift:
        dikaiosyne: "Paul: forensic gift from God → Pastorals: human moral uprightness"
        pistis: "Paul: dynamic trusting act → Pastorals: 'THE faith' (objective doctrine)"
        soter: "Paul: rare → Pastorals: frequent 'God our Savior' (Imperial Cult language)"
      stylistic_contrast: |
        Paul argues dialectically with rhetorical questions and incomplete sentences.
        Pastorals assert flatly, citing "faithful sayings" (pistos ho logos)—a phrase
        NEVER in undisputed Paul. Shift from argumentation to credal citation.
    
    historical_evidence:
      marcion_exclusion: |
        Marcion's canon (c. 140 CE) accepted 10 Pauline letters but excluded all 3 Pastorals.
        Either they didn't exist yet, or weren't recognized as Pauline in his community.
      p46_absence: |
        Papyrus 46 (c. 200 CE), earliest Pauline manuscript, does not contain Pastorals.
        Space calculations suggest original collection was 10 letters, not 13.
      church_structure: |
        Pastorals assume developed "monepiscopacy" (single bishop per city), presbyters,
        deacons—structures that developed late 1st/early 2nd century, not Paul's time.
    
    theological_trajectory:
      anti_gnostic_purpose: |
        The explicit warning against "falsely called gnosis" (1 Tim 6:20) and emphasis on
        guarding the "deposit" (paratheke) suggests a context where Gnostic/Marcionite
        interpretations of Paul had become threatening. The Pastorals "reclaim" Paul
        from his Gnostic enthusiasts by domesticating him.
      proto_catholic: |
        F.C. Baur (1835): Pastorals represent "Early Catholicism"—a synthesis reconciling
        Petrine and Pauline factions through institutional hierarchy. They're the first
        great pseudepigraphal achievement of the emerging orthodox church.
    
    critical_history:
      1807: "Schleiermacher attacks 1 Timothy authenticity based on vocabulary"
      1812: "Eichhorn extends doubt to all three—they stand or fall together"
      1835: "Baur: Pastorals are 2nd-century anti-heretical synthesis (c. 150 CE)"
      1921: "P.N. Harrison: statistical stylometry proves non-Pauline authorship"
      current: "Near-universal critical consensus: pseudepigraphical, c. 80-120 CE"
    
    amanuensis_hypothesis_failure:
      claim: "Paul used a different secretary (perhaps Luke) who wrote freely"
      rebuttals:
        - "All 3 letters share uniform style—same secretary for different times/places?"
        - "Stylistic divergence is so complete that 'secretary' = effective author"
        - "Luke parallels reinforce LATE dating (Luke-Acts = 80s-90s CE), not authenticity"
    
    framework_significance: >
      The Pastorals represent the proto-orthodox "rescue" of Paul from Marcionite/Gnostic
      appropriation. Marcion claimed Paul as sole true apostle preaching alien God against
      Jewish Creator. Orthodox response: forge letters showing Paul as Torah-respecting,
      hierarchy-supporting, marriage-affirming church builder. This "domesticated Paul"
      became the Paul of later Catholic tradition—but historical-critical method reveals
      the "Gnostic Paul" (anti-law, anti-matter, mystery religion) was chronologically prior.
    
    caveats:
      - "Some evangelical scholars still defend authenticity (minority position)"
      - "Dating range spans c. 80-140 CE depending on which 'heresy' is targeted"

    definition: >
      The 4.2 kiloyear aridification event (c. 2200 BCE), one of the most severe climatic
      episodes of the Holocene, caused widespread civilizational collapse across the Near
      East. Lasting 200-300 years, this mega-drought (30-50% rainfall reduction) triggered
      the simultaneous collapse of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia and the Old Kingdom
      in Egypt. In the Southern Levant, it ended the Early Bronze Age III urban culture;
      cities were abandoned en masse (not conquered), and society reverted to de-urbanized
      pastoral-nomadic patterns (Intermediate Bronze Age). This provides the scientific
      background for understanding cultural memory of "world-ending" catastrophes preserved
      in flood narratives.

      proxies:
        - "Italian cave speleothems showing isotopic shifts"
        - "Sediment cores from Red Sea and Dead Sea"

      magnitude: "30-50% reduction in eastern Mediterranean rainfall"
      duration: "Up to 200-300 years of persistent aridity"
      geographic_scope: "North Africa, Middle East, Indian subcontinent"
    
    archaeological_impact:
      akkadian_collapse: |
        Sargon's empire fell c. 2154 BCE; Gutian invasions coincide with drought
        period. Tell Leilan excavations show abrupt abandonment with no destruction layer.
      egyptian_decline: |
        Old Kingdom's end (First Intermediate Period) correlates with Nile failure.
        Texts describe famine and social chaos ("Ipuwer Papyrus" era).
      levantine_collapse: |
        EB III fortified cities abandoned without signs of warfare (e.g., Yarmuth).
        Digital Archaeological Atlas of the Holy Land (DAAHL) shows dramatic settlement
        decline. Population reverted to Intermediate Bronze Age pastoral patterns.
    
    intermediate_bronze_age:
      characteristics:
        - "De-urbanization and societal fragmentation"
        - "Shift to pastoral-nomadic lifestyle"
        - "Disappearance of monumental public architecture"
        - "Regionalized pottery showing breakdown of trade networks"
        - "'Period of depression' lasting until Middle Bronze Age urban revival"
    
    mythological_significance:
      flood_narrative_origins: |
        While not a literal flood, this climate catastrophe was a genuine "world-ending"
        event for urban civilizations. The cultural memory of collapse—fall of empires,
        abandonment of cities—would be preserved and mythologized over generations into
        the great flood stories of Mesopotamia and eventually Genesis.
      memory_preservation: |
        This explains why flood narratives (Atrahasis, Gilgamesh, Genesis) share structural
        similarities despite different details: they draw from the same deep cultural
        memory of genuine, widespread, society-ending catastrophe.

      causes: "Multi-causal: drought, Sea Peoples, trade network failure"
      significance: |
        A second major collapse event that enabled Israelite emergence. The framework
        notes both collapse events as genuine historical catastrophes underlying
        biblical memory—one informing primordial narratives (Noah), the other
        informing Exodus/Conquest narratives (liberation from Egypt).

      this 'world-ending' event in external history corresponds to the spiritual
      process of vastation—the destruction of the old selfhood that must precede
      regeneration. The 'new world' after the flood (new covenant, Noah's rainbow)

    domain: SWED
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      Swedenborg's acceptance of biblical historicity (Genesis 12 onward) was not uncritical
      faith but a methodological requirement for his "science of the spiritual world." His
      entire career—from scientific polymath to theological revelator—was a unified project
      to map the "anatomy of creation" in both physical and spiritual dimensions. When
      empirical study of the natural world reached its limits (he could map the brain but
      not dissect the soul), he turned to Scripture as divine "data set" for spiritual
      analysis. To question historicity would invalidate his experimental foundation, like
      an anatomist rejecting the reality of the body being dissected.
    
    scientific_background:
      neuroscience: |
        Correctly identified the cerebral cortex's role in cognition, not mere protection.
        Deduced brain motion synchronizes with respiration (verified 20th century).
        Attempted to locate the "seat of the soul" through anatomical investigation.
      cosmology: |

        Systematic mechanical thinking about universe origins.

        Overland transport of warships demonstrated applied genius.
      unified_goal: |
        All scientific work aimed at discovering the soul's nature and the
        "definite connection" between finite/material and infinite/spiritual worlds.
    
    methodological_structure:
      vertical_vs_horizontal: |
        Swedenborg: VERTICAL analysis—how each natural/historical event connects
        to spiritual world above it.
        Modern scholarship: HORIZONTAL analysis—how final text connects to prior
        historical events and oral traditions behind it.
        Not competing methods but different questions of the same text.
      data_requirement: |
        For his system to be a SCIENCE, it required objective, stable, empirical foundation.
        The literal sense of historical Word provided this foundation—the "specimen"
        for systematic analysis. Like anatomist needs real body, not hypothetical drawing.
      internal_distinction: |
        Genesis 1-11: "Made-up history" (Ancient Word fragments)—pure allegory
        Genesis 12 onward: "Real history"—divinely orchestrated correspondences
        This demonstrates critical capacity for non-literal reading where appropriate.
    
    historical_context:
      biblical_criticism: |
        Historical-critical method only emerging in German universities mid-18th century.
        For most of Swedenborg's life, accepting historicity was intellectual norm.
        No archaeological evidence yet existed to contradict narratives.
      absence_of_corroboration: |
        Modern archaeology is 19th-20th century development.
        Geological, volcanological data for "Mythic Bricolage" unavailable.
        Swedenborg couldn't engage evidence that wouldn't exist for 150 years.
      pre_darwinian: |

        in pre-scientific naturalism worldview.

      apparent_paradox: |
        "The critical scientist accepting literal Exodus" is anachronism—judging
        18th-century mind by 21st-century evidentiary standards.
        Within his framework, historical text WAS essential starting point
        for his unique form of critical (correspondential) analysis.

      - "Modern evidence clearly supports composite/bricolage models"

      "Key insight: The 'paradox' dissolves when we recognize Swedenborg's lifelong project.
      He was not abandoning reason for faith but extending scientific method into a new
      domain requiring different data. Just as a physicist accepts the reality of the
      particles observed in experiments, Swedenborg accepted Scripture as the 'observable
      data' of the spiritual world. His method was rigorous within its axioms: systematic,
      exhaustive, 'lab report' style analysis. The framework honors this by employing
      BOTH tiers—the historical-critical tier establishes 'what happened' (composite
      memory, bricolage), the correspondential tier establishes 'what it means' (spiritual
      regeneration process). Neither tier negates the other."

    title: "Correspondential Anthropology (Male/Female, Good/Truth)"
    domain: SWED
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      The foundational Swedenborgian doctrine that Male corresponds to Truth/Intellect
      and Female corresponds to Good/Will. This is not symbolic convention but rooted in
      creation's structure: males are formed to be creatures of intellect (understanding),
      females creatures of will (love/affection). This distinction permeates every aspect
      of the individual down to bodily form and persists after death. The divine archetype:
      Father = Divine Good (infinite Love), Son = Divine Truth (infinite Wisdom). These
      unite in the "Divine Marriage" - Good generates Truth as warmth generates light.
      Swedenborg's Trinity: one God with three aspects (Soul/Love, Body/Wisdom, Activity/
      Operation) within the one Divine Human, the Lord Jesus Christ.
    
    male_female_correspondence:
      male: |
        Corresponds to TRUTH and INTELLECT (the understanding)
        Innate affection for knowing, understanding, becoming wise
        External form: sterner face, rougher voice, stronger body
        Masculine proprium: "love of his own intelligence" (intellectual pride)
      female: |
        Corresponds to GOOD and WILL (love, affection)
        Innate love, particularly love for uniting with male's intellect
        External form: generally more beautiful form
        Feminine proprium: "love of her own natural affections"
      pervasive_nature: |
        Masculinity/femininity permeates every part, even thoughts and affections.
        Distinction endures after death in spiritual world.
    
    divine_archetype:
      father_as_good: |
        Father = Divine Good, infinite Divine Love
        The very essence of God, the originating source
        Corresponds to 'soul' of God
      son_as_truth: |
        Son = Divine Truth, infinite Divine Wisdom
        Truth conceived and born from Good (as light from warmth)
        Corresponds to 'body' or form of God
      divine_marriage: |
        Father and Son not separate but eternally united
        Father in Son, Son in Father (John 10:38, 14:10-11)
        Divine Good and Divine Truth inseparable
    
    swedenborgian_trinity:
      rejection_of_tripersonalism: |
        Explicitly rejects "one God in three distinct persons"
        God is absolutely one in both essence AND person
        Trinity = three essential aspects within ONE Divine Being
      structure:
        soul: "Father - Divine Essence, infinite Love/Good"
        body: "Son - Divine Human, Divine Wisdom/Truth (manifestation)"
        activity: "Holy Spirit - Proceeding Operation, life/power flowing from unified Love and Wisdom"
      human_image: |
        This Divine Trinity mirrored in human constitution:
        Soul (will/love), Body (understanding/wisdom's form), Mind (thoughts/actions)
    
    conjugial_love:
      definition: |
        Unique spiritual form of love between married partners
        "Conjunction of two into one mind" - husband = understanding, wife = will
        Originates from Divine Good and Divine Truth flowing from Lord
      proprium_transformation: |
        Both propriums (intellectual pride, natural affection) must be overcome
        Wife helps draw husband from male proprium through her love
        Husband's wisdom transforms into conjugial love directed to wife
        Wife's affections elevated by genuine truth (mediated through husband)
      internal_marriage: |
        Ultimate goal: "one mind" through conjunction of understanding and will
        Internal marriage of truth and good within individual = foundation
        External conjugial love reflects internal psychological integration
    
    functional_primacy_of_good:
      key_insight: |
        "Truth cannot possibly enter into marriage with good; but good does so with truth"
        Good (will, love, affection) possesses essential life, initiating desire, conjoining power
        Truth (intellect) provides form, structure, understanding—but Good is source of life
      implications: |
        Female correspondence has functional primacy in spiritual conjunction
        Wife plays active role in transformation
        Love is prior to wisdom in the divine order

      of psychological structure. Every person has both will (good/love) and understanding
      (truth/wisdom), and regeneration requires their integration. The 'internal marriage'
      precedes external conjugial union. The functional primacy of Good over Truth
      explains why love is the 'ruling love'—truth without love is dead information,
      but love always seeks its truth-form. The Divine Marriage (Father/Son united)
      is the archetype; human marriage is the earthly correspondence. The Trinity
      doctrine is distinctly Swedenborgian: one Person with three essential aspects,
      solving what Swedenborg saw as the 'tripersonalism' problem of orthodox theology."

    definition: >
      The cognitive linguistics framework proposing that all abstract thought is grounded 
      in concrete, sensorimotor experiences through systematic conceptual metaphors (e.g., 
      "understanding is seeing", "time is space"). This provides scientific substantiation 
      for Swedenborg's "representative language" of the Most Ancient Church—the innate 
      perception of spiritual meaning in natural objects ("high mountain" = "heaven"). CMT 
      demonstrates this as the foundational cognitive architecture of human thought, not a 
      lost mystical ability but the very mechanism by which meaning operates.

      communication through "innumerable changes of the countenance and lips" without

    definition: >
      A critical caveat acknowledging that Swedenborg's theological framework was 
      fundamentally shaped—and partially limited—by Enlightenment-era scientific paradigms. 
      His pre-theological career sought the "seat of the soul" through empirical anatomy; 
      when this failed, he sublimated the structural rigidity of his scientific training 
      into theology. Key limitations: (1) Matter viewed as "dead container" requiring 
      spiritual influx to animate; (2) Grand Man (Maximus Homo) projecting 18th-century 
      physiology onto heaven; (3) Physical body as impediment to be "put off" rather 
      than medium of revelation.

        Grand Man maps heaven onto human anatomy (heart=celestial, lungs=spiritual).

        To reconcile God with "dead" matter, Swedenborg posits "Divine Natural"—spiritual

    domain: SWED
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A rigorous three-criteria empirical test that transforms the Doctrine of 
      Correspondences from axiomatic claim into falsifiable hermeneutic filter. Tests 
      whether a text exhibits the structural properties of "The Word" (immediate 
      inspiration, infinite internal sense) versus "The Writings" (mediate inspiration, 
      author's meaning). The methodology distinguishes MYTHOS mode (correspondential 
      images as container/content) from LOGOS mode (naked abstract doctrine).
    
    three_validation_criteria:
      origin: >
        Is meaning inherent in the FUNCTION of the natural object (Symbol/Correspondence) 
        or invented by the author (Allegory)? True correspondences are ontologically grounded 
        in vertical causality—the lion IS power in natural form.
      continuity: >
        Does the spiritual sense form a coherent, unbroken narrative sequence (Series)? 
        The Word maintains continuous internal sense; Writings break into isolated gems.
      universality: >
        Is the correspondence consistent across different books and authors? In The Word, 
        "Lion" always means power (positive/negative by context), "Philistine" always means 
        faith-alone intellect. In Writings, names function as historical data.
    
    two_language_games:
      mythos_mode: >
        Container (natural image) → Content (spiritual meaning). Requires "unfolding." 
        Example: Samson tearing lion = Lord subjugating hells. The letter CLOTHES the truth.
      logos_mode: >
        Naked abstract argument. No container/content structure. Cannot apply correspondence 
        because text already IS the doctrine. Example: Romans 8 "Spirit of life" = the Spirit.

    key_finding: >
      The Science of Correspondences acts as a rigorous filter. The Swedenborgian 
      canon is not arbitrary selection but recognition of two fundamentally different 
      modes of divine communication: Immediate Revelation (The Word) creating direct 
      conduit to celestial heavens, and Mediate Revelation (Apostolic Writings) serving 
      to instruct the rational mind of the church.

      - "Validation is internal to Swedenborgian system, not external proof"
      - "Critics may see methodology as circular (using correspondences to prove correspondences)"

          "A wise son maketh a glad father" becomes static theology, not process

          Combat (Divine Truth fighting evil).
        book_of_esther: >
          No God-name appears in Hebrew text (secular/political origin). Attempting

          "King" normally = Divine Truth, but Ahasuerus acts capriciously (divorcing 
          Vashti, sanctioning genocide). Political causality too dense for vertical

    key_finding: >
      The investigation demonstrates Swedenborg's canon is not arbitrary "cherry-picking" 
      but rigorous application of semiotic laws. (1) Word texts demonstrate latent coherent 
      structure where even "weird" details (42 boys, bears) translate into consistent 
      regeneration theology. (2) Writings texts generate hermeneutic "noise" when same 
      keys applied—120-cubit porch creates monstrous form, Satan introduction disrupts 
      monistic flow, "Cloud" dissolves into crowd. (3) Distinction is not True/False or 
      Divine/Human but IMMEDIATE INSPIRATION (dictation/Word) vs MEDIATE INSPIRATION 
      (illumination/Writings).
    
    caveats:
      - "Tests presuppose Swedenborg's correspondence system as valid interpretive framework"
      - "Historical-critical scholars would read doublet variations as scribal/theological development"
      - "Cherry-picking charge merely shifted—why these specific test cases?"
      - "Validates internal coherence, not external truth of spiritual meanings"

      The "Internal Sense" is demonstrated as objective property of specific texts, 
      not arbitrary imposition. You cannot force correspondential meaning onto 
      Chronicles or Esther without breaking the code—they generate noise where 
      Samuel and Psalms generate signal. The methodology is the inverse of 
      critical scholarship: where critics see textual variation as evidence of 
      human development, the Swedenborgian sees it as evidence of ontological 
      category difference.

    title: "External Triangulation Validation (Circularity Problem Solution)"
    domain: SWED
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      An independent methodological framework for validating Swedenborgian correspondences 
      WITHOUT presupposing Swedenborg's charismatic authority. Addresses the epistemological 
      crisis of circularity by triangulating correspondence claims against five external 
      validation streams: (1) Source Criticism (Documentary Hypothesis), (2) Comparative 
      Semiotics (Philo, Kabbalah), (3) ANE Archaeology, (4) Depth Psychology (Corbin, Jung), 
      and (5) Predictive Testing. Establishes that validation = "hermeneutic coherence" and 
      "structural isomorphism" rather than positivist empirical proof.
    
    circularity_problem: >
      The standard apologetic argument—that Swedenborg's revelation is true because the 
      internal sense is coherent, and the internal sense is coherent because the revelation 
      is true—constitutes a closed logical loop. This unfalsifiability places Swedenborg's 
      exegesis outside conventional verification bounds. External triangulation solves this 
      by establishing non-circular validation criteria.

      source_criticism:
        description: >
          Documentary Hypothesis (JEDP) provides unintended validation. Swedenborg's

          Genesis 1 (P/Elohim/Transcendent/Order) = Spiritual Church regeneration via

          regeneration via Love/Will. Swedenborg "predicted" the qualitative difference

    title: "Three Gnostic Dismantling Tactics"

    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      A systematic analysis revealing three consistent strategies used by gnostic and 
      channeled systems to dismantle the specific, ultimate identity of the Divine Human 
      (Jesus Christ). While cosmologically incoherent, the strategy is "ruthlessly 
      consistent": attack the pure identification of the Being of Light encountered in 
      NDEs. The tactics: (A) Splitting—separate fallible Jesus from impersonal Christ 
      principle; (B) Renaming—change the name to break identification; (C) Hybridizing—
      use Christian language to deliver gnostic self-glorification message.
    
    tactic_a_splitting:
      mechanism: "Separate human 'Jesus' from divine 'Christ' principle"
      ancient_gnosticism: "Christ aeon descended at baptism, withdrew before crucifixion"
      theosophy: "Christos = impersonal divine principle indwelling all humans"
      urantia: "Jesus = incarnation of Michael of Nebadon, one of 700,000 Creator Sons"
      effect: "Jesus becomes exemplar/model, not Lord; Christ = our shared divine nature"
    
    tactic_b_renaming:
      mechanism: "Change the name to prevent pure personality identification"
      billy_meier: "Prophet's name was 'Jmmanuel, wrongly called Jesus Christ'"
      ascended_masters: "Master Jesus = galactic name 'Sananda,' Commander of saucer fleet"
      effect: "Breaks NDE identification—experiencers say 'I knew it was Jesus'; renamers say 'No'"
    
    tactic_c_hybridizing:
      mechanism: "Use Christian authority/language to deliver gnostic message"
      acim: "Claims dictation by 'Jesus himself' but teaches Christ = impersonal shared identity"
      ra_material: "Reframes Jesus as 4th-density Wanderer teaching Law of One, not Divine Lord"
      effect: "Sophisticated packaging—sounds Christian, delivers self-glorification"
    
    strategic_coherence:
      target: "The unique personality of the Being of Light"
      method: "Remove ultimacy, specificity, lordship from Jesus"
      goal: "Establish self as source of salvation (gnosis) rather than reception from Other"
      proprium_alignment: "Self-glorification requires dismantling of external Lord"
    
    nde_fingerprint_contrast:

    definition: >
      The fundamental operation of the Proprium: appropriating divine attributes (life, wisdom,
      power) and claiming them as intrinsic properties of the self rather than gifts received
      via influx. Swedenborg describes evil spirits who "insist stubbornly that they do live
      from themselves," refusing to acknowledge continuous influx from the Lord. The Proprium
      collapses the "As-of-Self" paradox (living AS IF life were one's own while acknowledging
      it is NOT) into an absolute claim: "As-if" becomes "Is." The Gnostic "Divine Spark"
      doctrine legitimizes this theft by defining the soul as consubstantial with the Divine,
      possessing life rather than receiving it.

    definition: >
      Two fundamentally incompatible modes of knowing and relating to Divine reality. INFLUX:
      Man is a VESSEL receiving life/truth from external Source (the Lord); requires continuous
      acknowledgment of dependence. GNOSIS: Man IS life or possesses divine fragment; salvation
      through self-realization rather than reception. These are "clay and iron" (Daniel 2)—they
      cannot mix. One cannot simultaneously believe "I am a created vessel dependent on the Lord"
      and "I am the uncreated Divine Spark." Proprium gravitates toward Gnosis (validates autonomy);
      rejects Influx (requires submission).

      experiencing 'inner spirituality.' Individuals trust their own intuitions as final arbiter

    definition: >
      A refined diagnosis of Pauline proprium showing that Paul's extensive humility 
      language (*doulos Christou*, "least of apostles," weakness boasting, suffering 
      catalogues) is BOTH authentic AND rhetorical—and this synthesis CONFIRMS rather 
      than refutes the proprium diagnosis. Paul exhibits "Proprium of the Spirit": not 
      worldly vanity but absolute confidence in private revelation superseding all 
      external authority. His humility is not simple arrogance but a complex theological 
      defense mechanism where the performative negation of the self establishes 
      unassailable pneumatic authority.
    
    key_mechanisms:
      derivative_authority: >
        "Slave of Christ" (*doulos*) functions as "Managerial Slave" claim—slave of 
        cosmic Lord = plenipotentiary above human accountability. To disobey Paul's 
        slave-instructions is to disobey the Master. Creates "diplomatic immunity" 
        from Jerusalem pillars.
      theology_of_immunity: >
        "Least of the apostles" = jurisdictional exit strategy. By confessing worst 
        sin (persecution), Paul places himself beyond human judgment. "Old Paul" is 
        dead; dead man cannot be judged by Law. Establishes "Sole Revelator" status.
      paradox_of_power: >
        Weakness boasting (2 Cor 11-12): Embracing weakness makes Paul rhetorically 
        invulnerable. Cannot shame man who claims shame as badge. Claims to be clearest 
        divine channel because most "broken" vessel.
      divine_proxy: >
        "Not I, but the grace of God" creates "blind trust" mechanism. Paul's actions 
        become direct Divine execution. To criticize Paul = criticize Grace itself.
    
    false_dichotomy: >
      The question "authentic humility vs. rhetorical strategy?" is FALSE dichotomy. 
      Paul's trauma as Persecutor is genuine; his mystical experiences are overwhelming. 
      BUT he weaponizes this trauma. By embracing "abnormal" apostle status, he creates 
      new category of Pneumatic/Charismatic apostle bypassing Historical/Institutional.
    
    proprium_diagnosis_refined:
      not_worldly: "Paul is NOT motivated by 'love of the world'—he genuinely suffers"
      pneumatic: "He IS motivated by 'love of private revelation'—Gnostic impulse"
      mechanism: >
        By claiming to be "nothing" (emptying/kenosis), he becomes container for 
        "everything" (Pleroma). Ultimate Intellectual Proprium: self-hood that inflates 
        to size of Divine by claiming no self at all. "Autotheism via Kenosis."

      "Proprium of the Spirit" = unique form of egoism where absolute confidence in 
      internal revelation supersedes all external authority. Paul's humility is the 
      hammer that breaks historical "vessels" (Judaism, Jerusalem Church) to release 
      pneumatic "spirit." Whether this is Fall or Redemption depends on value placed

    definition: >
      A third interpretive layer beyond Historical Jesus and Christ of Faith: the "Jesus 
      Profile" as the curated product of Divine Bricolage. The "Jesus we know today"—the 
      figure of absolute Love—is neither raw historical data nor pure theological 
      abstraction, but the intentional result of Providence guiding the editorial evolution 
      of the Jesus tradition. Historical Jesus = raw material (apocalyptic prophet); 
      Theological Jesus = curated profile (Universal Lover). Both are "real"—Bricolage 
      explains the divergence without denying either.

    title: "Universal Theosis Capacity (Degree vs. Kind)"
    domain: CROSS
    status: validated
    confidence: medium
    
    definition: >
      A critical theological argument that the difference between Jesus and the prophets 
      (and all humans) is one of DEGREE rather than absolute KIND. Swedenborg distinguished 
      Jesus by the nature of his soul (paternal = Jehovah directly; prophets = mediated 
      through angels). The Divine Bricolage framework argues this distinction is functional/
      teleological, not metaphysical: Jesus is the "Fullness of the Godhead bodily" who 
      "opened the pathway" for Divine expression in all humans. The prophets were "sons 
      of God" by adoption/bricolage; Jesus was "Son of God" by nature/incarnation—but His 
      work enables the same capacity for Theosis in all.
    
    swedenborg_distinction:
      prophets_mediate: >
        According to Swedenborg, prophets received influx via angels. Their personalities 
        suppressed or utilized as passive instruments. "Sons of God" in representative sense, 
        but soul remained human and finite.
      jesus_immediate: >
        Jesus had no human father; soul = Divine Itself (Jehovah). Immediate Influx—Divine 
        operating directly through human without angelic intermediary. Unique in kind.
      problem: >
        This creates a "new species"—Jesus categorically different from all other humans, 
        rather than "Firstborn among many brethren" (Romans 8:29).
    
    bricolage_corrective:
      degree_not_kind: >
        The distinction is functional (completeness of Divine expression) not metaphysical 
        (different type of being). Prophets = partial Divine vessels; Jesus = perfect/complete 
        Divine vessel. Same continuum, different magnitude.
      theosis_enabled: >
        Jesus "opened the pathway" for Divine expression in all humans. His unique Incarnation 
        makes possible the same union for others. To say God "cannot" express Himself fully 
        in a human is to limit the Omnipotent.
      prophets_as_precursors: >
        Prophets were active sites of Divine Bricolage—"hotspots" where Divine was welding 
        connection to humanity using materials at hand. Not passive dictation machines but 
        active participants in "wrestling match" with Divine.
    
    golden_age_restoration:
      most_ancient_church: >
        First Adam (before Fall) had direct access to God through "internal respiration." 
        This state was NORMATIVE for humanity.
      second_adam: >
        Jesus as Second Adam RESTORES this capacity to all humanity. Incarnation goal = 
        not create unique anomaly but reopen closed pathway.
      nde_validation: >
        Being of Light in NDEs validates all souls invited into direct connection. Lord 
        expresses Himself in "anyone He deems to" who undergoes regeneration.

      This is perhaps the framework's most theologically daring claim: Jesus is unique 
      but not uniquely DIFFERENT. He is the Fullness that enables others to partake of 
      the same nature. Swedenborg's error was making the distinction metaphysical rather 
      than functional. The prophets were "sons of God" because they were early bricolage 
      sites; Jesus was THE Son because in Him the process reached completion—and that 
      completion opened the pathway for all.

    domain: CONSC
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      Theory that Being of Light encounters represent objective phenomenological reality
      that experiencers describe using available cultural vocabulary. Validated through
      statistical analysis of 6,739 NDEs (NDERF: 5,646 + IANDS: 1,093). Core finding:
      61.8% of Being of Light encounters are identified as "unknown presence" - transcending
      ALL cultural categories - providing the strongest evidence for objective reality.
      Cultural vocabulary provides labels (God, Jesus, Allah), but the fundamental entity
      is consistent across all backgrounds with fixed properties (singular, loving, conscious,
      corrective, authoritative).
    
    caveats:
      - "Self-reported retrospective data (potential recall bias)"
      - "English-language dataset (cultural sampling bias)"

      The 61.8% "unknown presence" finding is the single most powerful evidence against

      with "Jesus" vocabulary available choose "unknown" when characteristics contradict
      taught theology (fear-based vs. love-based frameworks).

      The finding that 61.8% of Being of Light encounters (1,970 of 3,189 cases) are
      identified as "unknown presence" rather than cultural labels (God: 23.0%, Jesus:
      11.2%, Religious Figure: 4.0%). This transcendence of ALL cultural categories is
      the strongest evidence for objective reality - experiencers cannot project what
      they cannot conceive. Even Christians with available vocabulary ("God," "Jesus")
      choose "unknown" when the being's properties (loving, non-judgmental, accepting)

      would use available cultural vocabulary. The phenomenon exceeds human conceptual
      frameworks.

    status: preliminary
    confidence: medium
    
    definition: >
      Hypothesis that "unknown presence" classification reflects CHARACTERISTIC MISMATCH
      rather than pure inability to categorize. Christians taught fear-based theology
      (judgment, hell, conditional salvation) encounter a being with properties matching
      GOSPEL Jesus (unconditional love, acceptance) but not their TAUGHT version. When
      properties contradict framework, experiencers honestly classify as "unknown" rather
      than force-fit incorrect label. Evidence: "Unknown" identifiers show 75.4% belief
      change vs. 64.9% for "Jesus" identifiers, indicating greater cognitive dissonance.
      Core experiential properties are identical (communication 91.5% vs 90.5%, telepathy
      47.5% vs 50.4%) regardless of identification.
    
    caveats:

      an act of theological honesty.

      Statistical finding that complete fear of death loss occurs at virtually identical

      This cross-religious consistency (n=6,739) is powerful evidence that NDE experiences
      CORRECT rather than CONFIRM prior beliefs - external reality overrides diverse

      Stage 3 before Stage 2 or similar inversions. This suggests the 40% canonical
      rate reflects truncation (incomplete NDEs) rather than disorder. The stages
      exist; not all experiencers traverse all of them.

      Explicit acknowledgment that the third pathway in the Threefold Path cosmology -
      Restorative Incarnation (trauma-driven reincarnation following violent/premature
      death) - cannot be validated using NDE data. NDErs by definition survived; they
      cannot report on the correlation between violent death and subsequent rebirth.
      The >70% violent death rate in DOPS past-life cases (Stevenson, Tucker) must be

      A foundational Swedenborgian hermeneutic principle stating that in the language of 
      correspondences, prophets and representatives become TRANSPARENT to the spiritual 
      reality they embody. The "person" is obliterated and only the "function" remains. 
      When Ezekiel is addressed as "Son of Man" (90+ times), he IS the Doctrine of Truth 
      identifying Israel's sins—not a proto-Messiah. This resolves the apparent scandal 
      of 1 Enoch 71:14 ("You are that Son of Man"): Enoch represents the Collected Doctrine 
      of the Most Ancient Church, and in the visionary state, the Doctrine IS the Divine 
      Truth it contains. The law of Representation distinguishes INCARNATION (becoming

        In representation, "You are" is the ONLY valid reading. In the visionary state,

    definition: >
      A comprehensive validation case demonstrating that 1 Enoch, specifically the Book of 
      Parables (37-71), Astronomical Book (72-82), and Animal Apocalypse (85-90), survives 
      rigorous Swedenborgian stress tests and functions semiotically as a "Representative 
      Text"—a fragment of the Ancient Word preserved through textual transmission. Three 
      major tests passed: (1) UNIFORMITY TEST: Son of Man controversy resolved via 
      Representation doctrine; (2) ASTRONOMICAL TEST: 364-day calendar decoded as Sabbatical 
      Theology (State over Time); (3) COMPILATION TEST: Animal Apocalypse preserves church 
      cycle despite redaction. 1 Enoch is a "Broken Tablet" whose jagged edges fit precisely 
      into gaps of Swedenborgian spiritual history—a "Testament of the Celestial Church."

    definition: >
      The correspondential decoding of 1 Enoch's 364-day solar calendar as "Theology by 
      Geometry"—a symbolic system where astronomical measurements encode spiritual states 
      rather than physical accuracy. Core insight: 364 = 52 × 7 (perfect Sabbath 
      divisibility), subordinating natural time to spiritual holiness. The calendar 
      describes the Celestial Church's cognitive state where STATE (quality/holiness) 
      takes priority over TIME (quantity/motion). The deliberate "drift" from the physical 
      sun (~1.25 days/year) is not failed science but semiotic refusal to acknowledge a 
      state outside the Sabbath.
    
    numerical_theology:

        52 × 7 = perfect Sabbath divisibility. No remainder. Every aspect of the cycle

      its theological precision—it refuses to acknowledge a day outside the Sabbath. 
      The Sun/Moon contrast (Love/Faith) provides scriptural basis for New Church

    title: "Mēnōg/Gētīg Ontology (Zoroastrian Correspondence Framework)"
    domain: SWED
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      The foundational Zoroastrian ontology positing reality exists in two continuous 
      states: MĒNŌG (spiritual, invisible, archetypal—realm of seeds, roots, causes) 
      and GĒTĪG (material, visible, embodied—realm of fruit, manifestation, effects). 
      Unlike Platonic/Gnostic dualism where matter is corruption or prison, gētīg is 
      the PERFECTION and FRUITION of mēnōg—Ahura Mazda materialized spiritual creation 
      as a "fortress" against evil, not a fall. This creates binding reciprocal 
      correspondence: every physical object ontologically links to its spiritual 
      counterpart. The physical world is a readable text, not an illusion to escape. 
      Pre-dates Swedenborg's Natural/Spiritual plane distinction by millennia.
    
    key_principles:
      creation_stages: >
        Universe created in two stages: first 3,000 years in mēnōg state ("unthinking, 
        unmoving, intangible"—perfect spiritual forms), then translated into gētīg 
        state. Translation was strategic military maneuver to ensnare Angra Mainyu.
      correspondence_structure: >
        Because gētīg is direct translation of mēnōg, every material object has 
        specific spiritual root. No "dead matter"—a flower exists because a specific 
        Yazata sustains it from mēnōg realm. Physical form IS the correspondence.
      swedenborgian_parallel: >
        "The natural world exists and subsists from the spiritual world, just as 
        an effect from its efficient cause" (Swedenborg)—identical structure.

      This node captures a crucial distinction: Zoroastrian correspondence is

      natural world is the "basis" and "ultimate" of spiritual reality, not its 
      opposite. The convergence suggests access to shared archetypal understanding.

      The historical rupture of 330 BCE when Alexander the Great's forces destroyed 
      the Persepolis royal archives, including the legendary DAMDAT NASK ("Nask of the 
      Creation of Creatures")—a Zoroastrian encyclopedia cataloging natural 
      correspondences for animals, plants, elements, and the cosmos. Written on 
      12,000 prepared cow-hides with gold ink, it contained systematic taxonomy 
      mapping spiritual entities (Yazatas, Amesha Spentas) to physical creations. 
      This destruction constitutes a concrete historical mechanism for the "loss"

        Khrafstra (Ahrimanic counter-creations): snake, frog, scorpion, ant, mouse, 
        fly. "Miscreated" by Evil Spirit to corrupt world. Snake = deceitful, low,

      This node provides the historical "smoking gun" for the Ancient Word loss. 
      Alexander's destruction of Persepolis (330 BCE) is historically documented; 
      the Zoroastrian claim that systematic correspondence knowledge was lost in 
      this event provides a concrete mechanism for what Swedenborg described as the 
      fragmentation of the Ancient Word into scattered remnants preserved in the East.

  SWED-043:
    title: "Daniel as Rab-mag (Prophetic-Sapiential Synthesis)"
    domain: SWED
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      The historical-theological significance of Daniel's appointment as RAB-MAG 
      (Chief of the Magi/Wise Men) under Nebuchadnezzar (Dan 2:48, 5:11). Daniel 
      received training in "the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans" (Dan 1:4)—
      the entire corpus of Mesopotamian science including celestial omens (Enuma 
      Anu Enlil), terrestrial omens (Summa Alu), anomalous birth omens (Summa Izbu), 
      and dream interpretation. As Rab-mag, Daniel bridges the PROPHETIC tradition 
      (direct revelation from YHWH) and the SAPIENTIAL tradition (interpreting 
      signs of nature/history). He perfects rather than rejects the Chaldean science, 
      showing the true "Revealer of Mysteries" is the God of Heaven while using 
      Magian language (dreams, statues, beasts) to communicate that revelation.
    
    synthesis_function:
      prophetic_stream: "Direct revelation from YHWH (what will happen)"
      sapiential_stream: "Interpreting signs in nature/history (how to read the cosmos)"
      daniel_unique: >
        Combines both: reads correspondences (statue = empires, tree = king's judgment, 
        beasts = kingdoms) while attributing the revelation to the God of Heaven, 
        not human wisdom or astral mechanics.
    
    transmission_to_magi:
      star_prophecy: >
        Numbers 24:17 ("Star out of Jacob, Scepter from Israel") likely integrated 
        into Magian lore by Daniel or disciples. Daniel 9 ("seventy weeks" until 
        Messiah) provided timeline. Explains why Persian priests would care about 
        Jewish king at Nativity.
      magian_method: >
        The Magi of Matthew 2 practiced "Science of Correspondences"—they read the 
        star (Jupiter-Saturn conjunction in Pisces, sign of Jews) as SIGNIFIER of 
        spiritual reality (birth of Great Ratu/King), not random physical anomaly.
      survival_proof: >
        Nativity Magi validate existence of "wisdom tradition" surviving Alexander's 
        destruction—tradition knowing how to read heavens as text corresponding to 
        earthly history.

      summa_alu: "Omens from terrestrial events"

      dream_interpretation: "Reading 'night visions'"
    
    correspondence_examples:
      daniel_2: "Statue (gold, silver, bronze, iron, clay) = succession of empires"
      daniel_4: "Great tree cut down = judgment of Nebuchadnezzar's pride"
      daniel_7: "Four beasts from sea = four kingdoms"
      method: "Physical vision → spiritual meaning via correspondence"
    
    caveats:
      - "Book of Daniel's historical accuracy debated (many scholars date to 2nd c. BCE)"
      - "Rab-mag title interpretation contested"
      - "Magi narrative in Matthew considered legendary by critical scholars"

    notes: >
      Daniel represents the historical "bridge" figure who synthesized Israelite 
      prophetic revelation with the Magian cosmological tradition. His position as 
      Rab-mag gave him access to the Babylonian/Persian archives and enabled 
      integration of correspondence science into the Hebrew prophetic corpus. The 
      Magi at the Nativity demonstrate this transmission succeeded—Persian priests 
      applied Israelite messianic prophecy using Magian star-reading methods.

    title: "Dispensational Animal Sequence (Bull→Sheep→Bull)"
    domain: MYTH
    status: validated
    confidence: high
    
    definition: >
      The Animal Apocalypse (1 Enoch 85-90) encodes Swedenborg's dispensational history of 
      the churches through animal symbols: WHITE BULL (Adam-Isaac) = Celestial Church 
      (Natural Good/Innocence/Instinct); SHEEP (Jacob onward) = Spiritual Church 
      (Charity/Conscience/Obedience); WILD BEASTS (Gentiles) = Natural-Sensual 
      (ruled by passions); ESCHATOLOGICAL WHITE BULL (Messiah) = New Church / Restoration 
      of Celestial. The sequence Bull→Sheep→Bull describes a CIRCULAR rather than LINEAR 
      history—providence aims to recover the Celestial-Natural innocence of the Most 
      Ancient Church, not merely progress beyond it. This structural isomorphism survives 
      textual redaction, suggesting derivation from genuine perceptive tradition.
    
    animal_correspondences:
      white_bull:
        biblical_figures: "Adam, Seth, Noah, Abraham, Isaac"
        swedenborgian_era: "Most Ancient Church (Golden Age)"
        spiritual_state: "Celestial: Good of Love, Innocence, Instinct, Will-driven"
        significance: >
          Bull = Natural Good (powerful, instinctive, virile). White = Truth/Purity. 
          Most Ancient people were 'Celestial-Natural'—living in order of nature with 
          uncorrupted affections as strong as virile animal.
      black_bull:
        biblical_figure: "Cain"
        spiritual_state: "Evil: Faith separate from Charity"
        significance: "Black = Falsity/Evil. Cain's religion (faith alone) divorced from love."
      white_sheep:
        biblical_figures: "Jacob (Israel) and descendants"
        swedenborgian_era: "Ancient Church / Jewish Church"
        spiritual_state: "Spiritual: Good of Charity, Conscience, Obedience"
        significance: >
          Sheep = Spiritual Good (easily led, requires shepherd, non-violent). Transition 
          from Bull to Sheep marks shift from Celestial (Will/instinct) to Spiritual 
          (Intellect/conscience). The 'Flood' destroyed Most Ancient Will; new church 
          formed via conscience in understanding.
      wild_beasts:
        biblical_figures: "Gentile nations (Wolves, Lions, Boars)"
        swedenborgian_era: "Vastated Church"
        spiritual_state: "Natural-Sensual: ruled by passions and falsities"
      eschatological_white_bull:
        biblical_figure: "Messiah / Eschaton"
        swedenborgian_era: "New Church (New Jerusalem)"
        spiritual_state: "Celestial-Restored: Return to Love and Innocence"
        significance: >
          If Messiah were nationalist victor, should be 'Great Ram' (super-Israelite) or 
          'Lion' (conqueror). Reversion to 'Bull' = theology of RESTORATION (circular 
          history), not EVOLUTION (linear progress). Goal = recovery of Celestial-Natural 
          innocence with acquired wisdom.
    
    dispensational_mapping:
      sequence: "Bull → Sheep → Bull"
      swedenborgian_parallel: "Celestial Church → Spiritual Church → New Church"
      implication: >
        The Animal Apocalypse independently confirms Swedenborg's teaching that the 
        New Jerusalem returns to the state of the Golden Age but with fullness of 
        acquired wisdom. History is circular at its telos.
    
    redaction_survival:
      problem: "Animal Apocalypse is compiled/redacted from multiple traditions"
      observation: "Internal sense survives editing process"
      implication: >
        Just as J/P redaction in Genesis preserved Celestial/Spiritual distinction, 
        the redactor of 1 Enoch preserved the animal sequence because it corresponded 
        to actual spiritual dispensations. The underlying visions derived from genuine 
        perceptive tradition (Ancient Word).
    
    caveats:
      - "Historical-critical scholars see Animal Apocalypse as Maccabean political allegory"
      - "Swedenborgian mapping is interpretive overlay, not author's intention"
      - "Correspondence validation internal to Swedenborgian system"

    notes: >
      The Animal Apocalypse provides independent corroboration of Swedenborgian church 
      dispensations from a text Swedenborg identified as deriving from the Most Ancient 
      Church. The structural parallel (Celestial→Spiritual→Celestial-Restored) is too 
      precise to be coincidental. Key insight: the eschatological WHITE BULL (not Ram/Lion) 
      indicates theology of restoration, not conquest—matching New Church = 'Crown of 
      Churches' returning to Golden Age innocence with wisdom.
