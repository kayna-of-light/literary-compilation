# **The Solomonic Enigma: An Exhaustive Reconstruction of the Historical, Literary, and Esoteric King**

## **I. Introduction: The Fracture Between Icon and Evidence**

The figure of King Solomon, traditionally venerated in Western and Near Eastern consciousness as the paragon of wisdom, the architect of the First Temple, and the sovereign of a Golden Age empire, undergoes a radical and often violent deconstruction when subjected to the rigorous scrutiny of critical historiography, archaeological forensics, and esoteric phenomenology. The research dossier assembled for this investigation reveals a profound chasm between the "safe theological story"—the Sunday School icon of unalloyed wisdom and wealth—and the "Solomon of the documents." This latter figure is not a unified historical subject but a fractured composite: a modest Iron Age chieftain magnified by the lens of later Hasmonean political ambition; a literary character deployed by post-exilic scribes to critique the very institution of the Davidic monarchy; and, perhaps most startlingly, a spiritual archetype within the esoteric traditions who represents not wisdom, but the perilous state of "intellect separated from love."

This report, authored from the perspective of a historian of religion specializing in the intersection of Levantine archaeology and esoteric traditions, aims to synthesize these disparate vectors of investigation. It will navigate the tension between the "Maximalist" defenders of the biblical empire and the "Minimalist" revisionists who reduce 10th-century Jerusalem to a village. It will explore the "Magian" dimensions of Solomon’s wisdom, positing him as a Hebrew practitioner of the lost *Listenwissenschaft* (science of lists) that governed the ancient Near Eastern cosmology. Finally, it will descend into the "Spiritual Diary" of Emanuel Swedenborg to conduct a forensic audit of Solomon’s state in the afterlife, revealing a theological verdict that challenges the very definition of wisdom itself.

The "Real Solomon" that emerges from this exhaustive analysis is a figure of tragedy and paradox: a man who named the beasts but lost the kingdom; a builder of temples who, in the esoteric view, failed to build the temple within. This report will map the geography of this enigma, moving from the stratigraphy of Megiddo to the spiritual physiology of the "Grand Man."

## **II. The Material Crisis: Archaeology and the Myth of the United Monarchy**

The traditional historical consensus, which viewed the 10th century BCE as the "United Monarchy"—a centralized, bureaucratic empire spanning from the Euphrates to the border of Egypt—has effectively collapsed under the weight of recent archaeological data. The documents highlight a fierce and ongoing internecine war within the discipline of biblical archaeology between "Maximalists," who seek to preserve the biblical footprint of Solomon’s empire, and "Minimalists," who argue that the archaeological record has been fundamentally misread for a century.

### **A. The Gate Controversy: The Collapse of the Solomonic Blueprint**

For the latter half of the 20th century, the archaeological bedrock of the historical Solomon was the existence of monumental six-chambered city gates at three specific sites: Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. This architectural triad was famously linked by the Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin to a single biblical verse, 1 Kings 9:15: "And this is the reason of the levy which King Solomon raised; for to build... Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer." Yadin’s hypothesis was elegant in its simplicity: the gates at these sites were nearly identical in dimension and design, suggesting a single royal architect and a centralized administration capable of imposing a standard military blueprint across the varied topography of the Levant.1

However, the research documents indicate that this "Solomonic Blueprint" has been destabilized, if not dismantled, by the "Low Chronology" proposed by Israel Finkelstein and the Tel Aviv school of archaeology.

The Chronological Shift and the Omride Hypothesis  
The crux of the debate lies in the dating of the pottery assemblages found associated with these gates. Traditional dating (High Chronology) assigned the "Iron IIA" period, characterized by specific red-slipped and hand-burnished pottery, to the 10th century BCE—the biblical era of David and Solomon. The Low Chronology, utilizing rigorous radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic re-analysis, argues that this ceramic horizon actually belongs to the 9th century BCE—the era of the Omride dynasty of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.1  
The implications of this shift are catastrophic for the traditional Solomonic history. If the six-chambered gates and the associated monumental palaces (such as Palace 6000 and Palace 1723 at Megiddo) date to the 9th century, they were not built by Solomon. They were built by King Omri or his son Ahab.

* **The Theft of Glory:** This re-dating suggests that the biblical authors, writing centuries later in Judah, engaged in a form of literary appropriation. They took the monumental achievements of the Northern Kingdom—a powerful, cosmopolitan state confirmed by Assyrian records—and retrojected them onto the figure of Solomon, their own ancestral hero. The "wealth and power" ascribed to Solomon is, in this analysis, a memory of Ahab’s power, stolen to clothe the nakedness of the early Davidic dynasty.3  
* **The Gezer anomaly:** While excavators like William Dever vehemently defend the 10th-century date for the Gezer gate based on the presence of "hand-burnished" pottery in the destruction layers (attributed to the Egyptian Pharaoh Shoshenq I, c. 925 BCE), the consensus is no longer monolithic. The uniformity of the gates, once the "smoking gun" of Solomon’s empire, is now viewed by many as evidence of the later standardization of the Omride military administration.1

### **B. The Jerusalem Problem: The Village Capital**

The discrepancy between the biblical description of Solomon’s capital and the excavated reality of 10th-century Jerusalem is perhaps the most damning evidence against the empire hypothesis. The Bible describes a metropolis of international commerce, managing a trade network that stretched to Ophir (India or Africa?) and receiving 666 talents of gold annually.

The Demographic Reality  
Extensive excavations in the City of David and the Ophel have failed to produce the material culture of an imperial capital in the 10th century BCE.

* **Population Estimates:** The research suggests that Jerusalem in this period was a small, unfortified highland settlement, confined to the narrow ridge of the City of David. The population is estimated at perhaps 2,000 people—insufficient to sustain the bureaucracy, standing army, and labor force described in the text.  
* **The Missing Bureaucracy:** Empires run on paperwork (or clay tablets/ostraca). We have abundance of administrative seals and ostraca from the 8th and 7th centuries BCE (the time of Hezekiah and Josiah). From the 10th century, we have almost total silence. There are no royal inscriptions, no administrative dockets, no evidence of the complex taxation system detailed in 1 Kings 4\.5 The "Large Stone Structure" identified by Eilat Mazar as David’s palace remains an isolated and contested find, with many scholars dating its various phases to different periods, suggesting it may be a Jebusite fortress later repaired, rather than a new Solomonic palace complex.6

The Minimalist Verdict  
The "Minimalist" school concludes that the United Monarchy is a "literary fiction." There was no empire. David and Solomon were likely historical figures, but they were local "highland chieftains" ruling a rural, tribal dimorphic society. The "kingdom" was a loose confederation of clans, not a centralized state. The grand edifices of the "Solomonic" era were either non-existent or misdated structures belonging to later periods.

### **C. The Hasmonean Projection: The Architecture of Memory**

If Solomon did not rule a vast empire, where did the vivid, detailed descriptions of his kingdom come from? They are too specific to be mere fairytales. The research documents offer a compelling solution: the **Hasmonean Projection**.

The document "Persian Roots of Early Christianity" and others argue that the biblical description of the United Monarchy is a backward projection of the **Hasmonean Kingdom** (c. 140–63 BCE).

* **The Historical Template:** The Hasmoneans (Maccabees) were the first Jewish dynasty since the exile to actually control the territory described in the Solomonic narratives—expanding into Idumea (Edom), Samaria, and Galilee. They were a priestly-royal dynasty that combined religious authority with military conquest.7  
* **Literary Retrojection:** Late Second Temple scribes, operating in the Hasmonean court or shortly thereafter, likely edited the ancestral traditions of David and Solomon to mirror the geopolitical reality of their own time. The "Golden Age" of the past was constructed to legitimize the expansionist policies of the present. Solomon’s control over the "Way of the Sea" and the "King’s Highway" reflects Hasmonean strategic interests, not 10th-century realities.  
* **Palatial Parallels:** The descriptions of Solomon’s building projects—the winter palaces, the aqueducts, the luxurious courts—bear a striking resemblance to the Hasmonean winter palaces excavated at Jericho. These Hellenistic-era structures, with their swimming pools, bathhouses, and reception halls, provided the visual vocabulary for the scribes describing Solomon’s "House of the Forest of Lebanon".9 The "Solomon" of the text is thus a Hasmonean king in Iron Age drag.

## **III. The Literary Reconstruction: Solomon as Scribal Device**

Moving from the material ground to the textual fabric, we find that the "Solomon" of the Hebrew Bible is not a static biography but a dynamic literary function. The research suggests that the biblical narrative is composed of conflicting strata, each using Solomon to argue a different theological point.

### **A. The Succession Narrative: Propaganda or Anti-Monarchic Satire?**

The literary block comprising 2 Samuel 9–20 and 1 Kings 1–2, known as the "Succession Narrative" or "Court History," details the intricate and bloody process by which Solomon ascended to the throne.

The Traditional View: Solomonic Apologetic  
For much of the 20th century, following the work of Leonhard Rost, this narrative was viewed as a piece of contemporary propaganda, written perhaps by a court scribe like Ahimaaz or Nathan during Solomon’s reign. Its purpose was to legitimize Solomon’s usurpation of the throne from his older brother Adonijah (the rightful heir by primogeniture) by showing that God and David sanctioned it.11  
The Critical Reassessment: The Anti-Monarchic Novella  
The research documents reveal a significant shift in consensus. Scholars like John Van Seters and the "revisionist" school now argue that this narrative is a post-exilic critique of the Davidic house.13

* **The Ruthless Purge:** Far from a hagiography, the text portrays Solomon as a Machiavellian autocrat who initiates his reign with a Stalinist purge. He executes his brother Adonijah (despite promising him safety), kills the general Joab (violating the sanctuary of the altar), and assassinates the Benjaminite Shimei.  
* **David’s "Mafia Don" Advice:** The narrative reaches a pinnacle of irony in 1 Kings 2, where the dying David instructs Solomon. David advises his son to use his "wisdom" not to govern justly, but to find technical loopholes to execute men David had sworn oaths to protect. "You are a wise man," David says, "you will know what to do to him... bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood." The text presents Solomon’s "wisdom" as the cunning of a hitman, exposing the moral rot at the very foundation of the dynasty.11  
* **The Theological Function:** In this reading, the narrative is a "literary novella" designed to explain the failure of the monarchy. It demonstrates that the seeds of the Exile were planted at the very beginning. The kingdom was established not on divine law, but on fratricide and political murder.

### **B. The Deuteronomistic Pivot: The Conditional King**

The "Deuteronomistic Historians" (Dtr), writing during the Exile, used Solomon as the theological fulcrum of Israel’s history. They structured his reign to demonstrate the shift from the "Unconditional Covenant" of David to the "Conditional Covenant" of the Mosaic Law.

* **The Violation of Deuteronomy 17:** The narrative of Solomon’s wealth explicitly tracks his violation of the prohibitions for kings laid out in Deuteronomy 17\. He "multiplies horses" (importing them from Egypt), he "multiplies wives" (700 wives, 300 concubines), and he "multiplies gold." The Dtr historian presents Solomon’s "glory" as his "crime." The very things that made him a great ancient Near Eastern monarch—harem, treasury, cavalry—were the things that defined him as an apostate in the eyes of the Deuteronomists.13  
* **The High Places:** The narrative tension—Solomon "loved Yahweh" yet "sacrificed at the high places"—reflects the projecting of later Josianic reforms (7th century BCE) back onto the 10th century. Solomon serves as the negative example that justifies the later centralization of the cult.

### **C. The Porch Discrepancy: A Case Study in Theological Redaction**

The research highlights a specific architectural discrepancy between the books of Kings and Chronicles that serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the "evolving Solomon."

| Feature | 1 Kings 6:3 (The Early Source) | 2 Chronicles 3:4 (The Post-Exilic Rewrite) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Porch Width** | 20 cubits | 20 cubits |
| **Porch Height** | (Implied 30 cubits, matching the house) | **120 cubits** |

The Tower of Chronicle  
The Chronicles account describes the temple porch (ulam) as a massive tower, 120 cubits high (approx. 60 meters or 20 stories). This is architecturally improbable for the structural technology of the time and disproportionate to the rest of the building (which was 30 cubits high).

* **The Theological Inflation:** Architectural historians dismiss the 120-cubit height as a scribal error or a fantasy. However, the documents suggest this was a deliberate theological exaggeration by the Chronicler. Writing after the Exile, the Chronicler sought to portray the First Temple not just as a building, but as a transcendent, almost mythical structure—a "skyscraper" of holiness that reflected the infinite glory of God. It represents the "Hasmonean" or "Second Temple" tendency to magnify the past to serve the ideological needs of the present.16  
* **The Swedenborgian Resolution:** As will be discussed in Section V, esoteric analysis resolves this not as an error, but as a spiritual correspondence describing the "inflation" of the natural mind.16

## **IV. The Magian Sage: Solomon and the "Lost Science"**

The research documents introduce a fascinating "third dimension" to Solomon, moving beyond the binary of History vs. Myth. This is the **Magian Solomon**—the master of a lost "Science of Correspondences" that linked the physical taxonomy of the world to the spiritual hierarchy of the heavens.

### **A. Solomon and *Listenwissenschaft***

The biblical statement in 1 Kings 4:33—"He spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes"—is typically read as a poetic tribute to his intellect. However, the documents reframe this as a technical description of a specific ancient Near Eastern intellectual genre: **Listenwissenschaft** (The Science of Lists).7

* **The Encyclopedic Tradition:** In the intellectual world of Mesopotamia and Egypt, "science" consisted of the exhaustive categorization of reality. To list a thing was to know its essence and to control it. The structure of Solomon’s knowledge (Trees \-\> Beasts \-\> Birds \-\> Reptiles \-\> Fish) mirrors the taxonomic lists found in Mesopotamian lexical texts (like *URRA=hubullu*) and, crucially, in the lost Zoroastrian scientific corpus.19  
* **The Damdat Nask:** The documents draw a specific parallel between Solomon’s wisdom and the **Damdat Nask**, a lost book of the Zoroastrian Avesta known through later summaries in the *Denkard*. The *Damdat Nask* was a vast encyclopedia of cosmology, zoology, and botany, organizing the world into "beneficent" and "noxious" creatures. The research posits that Solomon functioned as the Hebrew avatar of this Magian sage-scientist, the *ummanu* who possessed the "blueprint" of creation.19

### **B. The Doctrine of Correspondences**

This "nature wisdom" was not merely biological; it was **correspondential**. The "Celestial Scribe" document argues that Solomon’s wisdom was an expression of the **Doctrine of Correspondences**—the worldview that every natural object is the mirror of a spiritual reality (Mēnōg) manifesting in the physical world (Gētīg).

* **Naming as Power:** Just as Adam named the animals by perceiving their spiritual affection, Solomon’s wisdom consisted of deciphering the "code" of the universe. He understood that the "cedar" corresponded to the rational intellect of the spiritual man, while the "hyssop" corresponded to external purification. He read the world as a book written by God.20  
* **The Slide into Magic:** The documents trace the trajectory of this wisdom into the "dark side." The line between "knowing the essence" of a thing and "controlling" it is thin. Later traditions, such as the *Testament of Solomon* (alluded to in the context of Magian science), portray Solomon using this taxonomic knowledge to bind demons. This represents the corruption of the "Ancient Wisdom"—when the knowledge of spiritual causes is used for power (magic) rather than for worship.

### **C. The Corruption of the Ancient Word**

The research interprets Solomon’s infamous "fall" into idolatry not as a lapse of judgment, but as an **epistemological corruption**.

* **Foreign Wives as Foreign Sciences:** In the Swedenborgian and Magian analysis, Solomon’s 700 wives and 300 concubines are not merely a harem; they symbolize the promiscuous assimilation of various religious and intellectual systems ("foreign sciences"). His "whoredom" was the syncretic mixing of the holy "science of correspondences" with the idolatrous, externalized magic of the surrounding nations.  
* **The End of an Era:** Solomon represents the final phase of the "Ancient Church" (which possessed intuitive wisdom) collapsing into the "Jewish Church" (which possessed only representative rituals). He is the figure who buries the "Ancient Word" under the weight of gold and foreign altars.22

## **V. The Esoteric Verdict: Swedenborg’s Spiritual Diary**

The most radical re-evaluation of Solomon comes from the Swedenborgian corpus contained in the research documents. Unlike the biblical text which lauds his wisdom, or the critical text which doubts his power, the **Spiritual Diary** (*Experientiae Spirituales*) of Emanuel Swedenborg presents a forensic audit of Solomon’s state in the afterlife.

### **A. The State of Folly: A Spiritual Autopsy**

Swedenborg reports direct, phenomenological interactions with the spirit of Solomon in the spiritual world. The verdict is shocking: the man famous for wisdom is found to be **devoid of it**.23

* **The Distinction of Wisdoms:** Swedenborg distinguishes between "natural scientifics" (accumulated facts, philosophy, memory-knowledge) and "spiritual wisdom" (perception of truth grounded in love for the Lord). Solomon possessed the former in abundance but lacked the latter entirely.  
* **The Scene of Vastation:** In the *Spiritual Diary*, Solomon is depicted not on a throne, but in a state of anxiety and stupidity. He is shown searching for "wisdom" but unable to find it, because in the afterlife, external knowledge that is not rooted in internal charity is stripped away (a process called *vastation*). He serves as a cautionary archetype of *Sola Fides* or "Intellect Alone"—the brilliant mind that can categorize the universe but cannot love the neighbor.24  
* **The Western Quarter:** Spirits in Swedenborg’s topography are arranged by their "ruling love." Solomon is often located in the "Western Quarter," associated with the love of self and the world, or with those who seek "dominion and gain." This contrasts with the "Eastern Quarter" where true celestial love resides.

### **B. The Temple Porch as Spiritual Diagnostic**

The Swedenborgian analysis resolves the "Kings vs. Chronicles" architectural discrepancy (20 vs. 120 cubits) through the lens of internal spiritual states.

* **20 Cubits (Kings) \= The State of Remains:** The number 20 corresponds to "remains"—the hidden states of good and truth stored in a person’s interior by the Lord. This is the reality of the spiritual life: often modest, hidden, and structurally integrated with the sanctuary (the inner man).  
* **120 Cubits (Chronicles) \= The State of Inflation:** The number 120 (12 x 10\) can signify a "residue" or a fullness of the vast "natural man." The Chronicles account, with its towering 120-cubit porch, depicts the Temple as it appears to the **Natural Mind**—imposing, externally glorious, and eager to reach heaven by its own height (a "Tower of Babel" motif). The discrepancy reveals the spiritual pathology of Solomon: an external religiosity (the high porch) that far exceeded his internal reality.16

### **C. The David vs. Solomon Antithesis**

While David represents the "Spiritual" degree of the mind (the fighter, the one who combats evil truths), Solomon represents the "Celestial" or "Rational" degree (the state of peace). However, because Solomon turned to idolatry, he represents the **profanation** of that high degree. The "Peace of Solomon" is not the peace of victory (David), but the peace of stagnation, sensory indulgence, and the cessation of spiritual combat. In the Swedenborgian view, David (despite his sins) is in a higher spiritual state than Solomon because David possessed a "heart of flesh" (repentance/love), while Solomon possessed a "heart of stone" (intellect/fact).27

## **VI. The Lineage Crisis: The Cursed Bloodline and the Desposyni**

The final dimension of the Solomonic problem lies in his biological legacy. The documents highlight a genealogical crisis that early Christianity had to navigate: the "Curse of Jeconiah" and the legitimacy of the "Desposyni" (the family of Jesus).

### **A. The Curse of Jeconiah: The Broken Chain**

Jeremiah 22:30 pronounces a devastating curse on **Jeconiah** (Coniah), a direct lineal descendant of Solomon: "Write ye this man childless... for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah." This curse effectively de-legitimized the Solomonic line of kings.28

The Matthew vs. Luke Solution  
This creates a theological crisis for the Messiah, who must be a "Son of David."

* **Matthew’s Genealogy:** Traces Jesus’s legal lineage through Solomon \-\> Jeconiah \-\> Joseph. Critics argue this disqualifies Jesus from the throne due to the curse.  
* **Luke’s Genealogy:** Traces Jesus’s lineage through **Nathan**, another son of David (Solomon’s brother), bypassing the Solomonic line entirely. The research suggests that early Christian theologians (and perhaps the Desposyni themselves) favored the Nathanic line as the "biological" and "curse-free" alternative to the corrupted Solomonic dynasty. Solomon was the king of "glory," but Nathan was the progenitor of the "remnant".28

### **B. The Desposyni: The Royal House in Exile**

The documents reveal that the "Desposyni" (relatives of Jesus) were not merely a religious family but a structured **political dynasty** tracked by the Roman Empire.

* **The "Royal House":** The family of Jesus maintained a strict dynastic succession, passing leadership of the Jerusalem Church from Jesus to his brother James the Just, then to his cousin Simeon. They viewed themselves as the "legitimate government of Israel in exile," preserving the "Royal Blood" against the Herodian usurpers.32  
* **The Domitian Investigation:** The political threat of this Solomonic/Davidic bloodline was so potent that the Roman Emperor Domitian (r. 81–96 CE) ordered an investigation to "hunt down all descendants of David." The Desposyni were arrested and interrogated. They survived only by showing their calloused hands—proving they were simple farmers, not insurrectionists—and by claiming their kingdom was "not of this world." This incident confirms that the lineage of David/Solomon was a recognized biological reality in the 1st century, monitored by imperial intelligence.32

## **VII. Conclusion: The Composite King**

The "Real Solomon" revealed in these research documents is a far more fractured, complex, and troubling figure than the wise monarch of legend. He serves as a prism through which we can see the competing agendas of history, theology, and mysticism.

1. **Historically**, he is a phantom of the 10th century—likely a local highland chieftain ruling a modest village-state. The "Empire of Solomon" is a literary ghost, constructed by projecting the power of the 9th-century Omrides and the 2nd-century Hasmoneans back into the mythic past.  
2. **Literarily**, he is a character in a "Court History" designed to critique the institution of monarchy itself. He is the "Conditional King" whose accumulation of wealth and wives explains the national trauma of the Exile.  
3. **Scientifically**, he is the Hebrew avatar of the *Magian* sage, the master of *Listenwissenschaft* who categorized the cosmos but lost his soul to the "foreign sciences" he studied—a warning against the accumulation of knowledge without the grounding of spiritual love.  
4. **Spiritually**, the verdict is most damning. As detailed in Swedenborg’s *Spiritual Diary*, Solomon represents the tragedy of the "Hyper-Intellect." He is the man who built the Temple of stone but left the Temple of the mind empty. He stands in the afterlife as a monument to "Folly"—proof that one can possess all the wisdom of the earth and yet lack the only wisdom that matters in heaven.

In the final analysis, the Solomon of the documents is not a model to be emulated, but a mirror reflecting the dangers of power, the seduction of intellect, and the fragility of human glory. He is the king who gained the whole world—or at least the literary description of it—and lost his own soul.
