## Open Questions

### Critical Analysis Follow-Up Questions

The following questions emerged from rigorous critical review of framework claims (2025-12-27). These require external research to strengthen or revise framework positions.

---

### [NDE] Cross-Cultural Being Identification

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework claims NDErs identify "Being of Light" as Jesus based on personality match, even atheists/non-Christians. Critical analysis challenges this: selection bias (most studies in Christian-majority cultures) and expectation effects. Need cross-cultural statistical data.

**Research Question**:
In NDEs from Hindu-majority, Buddhist-majority, and Islamic-majority populations, what percentage of experiencers identify the "Being of Light" encountered as:
1. Jesus Christ
2. Deities from their cultural tradition (Krishna, Yamaraj, Buddha, etc.)
3. Generic "deceased relatives" or unnamed beings
4. No being encountered

Does personality-based identification transcend cultural conditioning, or do experiencers interpret the encounter through pre-existing religious frameworks?

**Notes**:
If Hindu NDErs predominantly report Hindu deities rather than Jesus, framework's "pure identification" claim requires revision. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 7B.

---

### [GDR] Dying Brain Hypothesis - Current State

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework interprets NDEs as evidence for post-mortem consciousness. Critical analysis notes framework doesn't adequately engage strongest neuroscientific alternatives. Need comprehensive review of current dying brain research to address fairly.

**Research Question**:
What is the current state of neuroscientific explanations for NDE phenomenology? Specifically:
1. Borjigin et al. (2013) findings on surge of brain activity at death
2. DMT hypothesis (Strassman; endogenous release at death)
3. Temporal lobe seizure models for life review
4. Visual cortex explanations for tunnel/light
5. Recent AWARE study results and methodological critiques

How do neuroscientists explain veridical perception cases? What are the strongest counterarguments to materialist explanations that framework should address?

**Notes**:
Framework should engage this literature seriously, not dismissively. Veridical perception is framework's strongest evidence; need to know neuroscience's best responses. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 7A.

---

### [GDR] Dual Inheritance Theory vs. CDE

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework proposes Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) as selective pressure on memetic evolution. Critical analysis notes simpler alternatives (Dual Inheritance Theory, Cultural Group Selection) may explain same data without metaphysical consciousness-as-causal-force. Need comparison.

**Research Question**:
How do Boyd & Richerson's Dual Inheritance Theory and Wilson & Wilson's Cultural Group Selection explain the evolution of cooperation and cultural trajectories? Specifically:
1. What predictions do these theories make about cultural evolution?
2. How do they explain the emergence of prosocial norms without "ruling love" mechanism?
3. What empirical tests distinguish these theories from CDE?
4. Do these theories require consciousness-as-fundamental or treat it as epiphenomenon?

Can CDE make any prediction that these simpler theories cannot? What would constitute evidence *requiring* consciousness as causal driver rather than accompanying correlate?

**Notes**:
If simpler theories explain same data, Occam's Razor favors them unless CDE adds unique predictive power. Framework needs honest comparison. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 2B and `alternative_theories.md` action item.

---

### [GDR] Oral Tradition Stability Research

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework cites Aboriginal songlines preserving "14,000-year narratives" as evidence oral traditions could preserve Ancient Word. Critical analysis notes: geographic features dating to post-glacial period ≠ narrative content remaining unchanged. Need linguistic/anthropological research on oral tradition drift.

**Research Question**:
What is the scholarly consensus on stability vs. drift in oral traditions over millennia? Specifically:
1. Jack Goody's work on oral vs. literate cultures
2. Studies of transmission fidelity in non-literate societies
3. Difference between preserving geographic/ecological information vs. narrative content
4. Documented cases of oral tradition modification over generations
5. Australian Aboriginal songline research: what's verified vs. romanticized?

Can oral traditions preserve *specific narrative content* accurately over 10,000+ years, or do they exhibit significant drift and innovation while maintaining thematic continuity?

**Notes**:
Framework needs this to support Ancient Word hypothesis. If oral traditions show substantial drift, claim that Ancient Word could persist accurately through oral transmission weakens. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 4B.

---

### [NLM] Swedenborg's Cultural Context

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework applies historical-critical method to Bible but not to Swedenborg's writings. Critical analysis recommends either applying HCM consistently or acknowledging asymmetry. If applying HCM to Swedenborg, need analysis of cultural/intellectual influences.

**Research Question**:
What 18th-century intellectual currents influenced Swedenborg's theological system? How do his doctrines relate to:
1. Swedish Lutheran pietism and mysticism
2. Cartesian dualism (mind-body separation)
3. Neoplatonic emanation theories
4. Kabbalistic traditions (his knowledge of Jewish mysticism)
5. Paracelsus and Jakob Boehme (earlier Christian mystics)
6. Enlightenment rationalism (his scientific background)

To what extent are Swedenborg's "correspondences" original vs. synthesizing existing symbolic interpretation traditions? How did his theology evolve across his corpus (*Arcana Coelestia* → *True Christian Religion*)?

**Notes**:
This is **sensitive** but necessary for intellectual honesty. Can accept Swedenborg as revelatory while acknowledging cultural situatedness (as with biblical authors). See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 1C and `framework_improvement_action_plan.md` Action 1.3.

### [GDR] Proto-Luke Hypothesis Scholarly Status

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework presents Proto-Luke (Jamesian protograph) as significant source. Critical analysis notes: hypothesis stacked on hypothesis (Markan priority → Q → L → Proto-Luke → Jamesian attribution). Knowledge graph acknowledges "hypothesis stacked on hypothesis" with low confidence. Need current scholarly assessment.

**Research Question**:
What is the current status of B.H. Streeter's Proto-Luke hypothesis (1924) in NT scholarship? Specifically:
1. How many contemporary scholars accept Proto-Luke as distinct pre-Lukan source?
2. Main arguments FOR Proto-Luke (textual evidence, coherence)
3. Main arguments AGAINST (can be explained by Lukan redaction of Mark + Q + L)
4. Relationship to Klinghardt's Marcionite hypothesis (contested minority view)
5. How does "Jamesian protograph" attribution relate to standard Proto-Luke theory?

Is there textual evidence *requiring* Proto-Luke, or can Lukan peculiarities be explained by editorial activity on standard sources?

**Notes**:
Framework relies heavily on this for Jamesian tradition reconstruction. If hypothesis is marginal in scholarship, claims should be marked speculative. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 14C and knowledge graph EARLY-002 caveats.

---

### [GDR] DOPS Verification Rate

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework emphasizes strongest DOPS cases (James Leininger, Ryan Hammons) with verified statements and birthmarks. Critical analysis asks: What's the *overall* verification rate? Cherry-picking strongest cases while ignoring weaker ones inflates evidential strength.

**Research Question**:
Of the 2,500+ cases documented by UVA DOPS:
1. What percentage have *any* verified statements?
2. What percentage have *multiple* verified statements?
3. What percentage have physical correspondences (birthmarks to wounds)?
4. What percentage lack verification (no documentation found)?
5. How do researchers handle cases where verification attempts fail?

What are the methodological critiques of DOPS research (information leakage, cryptomnesia, selective reporting)? How strong are Tucker's responses to these critiques?

**Notes**:
Framework should report both successes and failures. If verification rate is low (even 10-20% would be remarkable), that context matters for assessing evidential strength. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Section 14C.

---

### [NLM] Paul's Self-Abasement Passages

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27

**Context**:
Framework characterizes Paul as exhibiting "proprium" (self-love) based on confrontational passages and authority claims. Critical analysis notes: Paul also has extensive self-abasement language (servant, slave, least of apostles, weakness boasting in 2 Corinthians). Need balanced assessment.

**Research Question**:
How do Pauline scholars interpret passages where Paul describes himself with extreme humility? Examples:
1. "Slave of Christ" (δοῦλος Χριστοῦ)
2. "Least of the apostles" (1 Cor 15:9)
3. Weakness boasting (2 Cor 11-12)
4. Suffering catalogues (2 Cor 6:4-10)

Do scholars see these as:
- Authentic humility (Paul's genuine self-perception)
- Rhetorical strategy (establishing authority paradoxically)
- Mixed: Sincere humility alongside prophetic zeal

How does this complicate framework's "proprium" diagnosis?

**Notes**:
Framework selectively emphasizes confrontational Paul; needs to address humble Paul. Can't cherry-pick. See `critical_analysis_report.md` Sections 5A and 9.

## DOMAIN 1: CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES — EMPIRICAL VALIDATION GAPS

### [CONSC] Life Review Empathetic Component Statistical Frequency

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-003, CROSS-003

**Context**:
Framework claims life review's empathetic component (feeling impact of actions from others' perspectives) reveals ruling love and enables self-judgment. This is critical evidence for the post-materialist framework—it would demonstrate a moral/consciousness dimension that dying brain models cannot easily explain.

**Research Question**:
What percentage of NDEs with life review component report experiencing events from others' emotional perspectives (empathetic reciprocity)? How does this compare to life reviews described as purely observational/memory replay? Is there correlation between empathetic life reviews and subsequent life transformation? Are there cultural variations in this feature?

**Expected Impact**:
High empathetic component frequency would strengthen framework's ruling love revelation claim. If most life reviews are non-empathetic memory replays, framework interpretation needs revision.

**Notes**:
See CONSC-003 caveats in knowledge graph. This distinguishes framework's theological interpretation from simpler "brain playing memories" explanations.

---

### [CONSC] Distressing NDEs and Hellish Experiences

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-004, SWED-003

**Context**:
Framework emphasizes blissful NDEs with beings of light. Critical analysis notes distressing/hellish NDEs exist but are underrepresented in framework documents. Swedenborg's cosmology predicts post-mortem experiences reflect ruling love—self-centered souls should experience initial distress until externals stripped away.

**Research Question**:
What percentage of documented NDEs are classified as distressing, frightening, or hellish? What are common features (void, demonic beings, sense of condemnation, isolation)? What demographic/psychological profiles correlate with distressing NDEs? Do experiencers report subsequent life changes similar to positive NDEs, or different trajectories? Are there cultural/religious variations in distressing NDE frequency?

**Expected Impact**:
Could validate Swedenborgian prediction that ruling love determines initial post-mortem experience. If distressing NDEs are very rare, framework needs to address why Swedenborg's cosmology doesn't match empirical patterns.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis identified this as cherry-picking weakness. Must address full phenomenological range, not just confirming cases.

---

### [CONSC] Veridical Perception Verification Rate in AWARE Studies

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-004

**Context**:
Framework cites veridical perception during cardiac arrest as strongest evidence consciousness operates independently of brain. Critical analysis notes: must report overall success/failure rates in controlled studies, not just remarkable anecdotes. AWARE study (Parnia 2014) had ~2000 cardiac arrests with hidden targets.

**Research Question**:
In the AWARE study and follow-up AWARE II, what were the total numbers: (1) cardiac arrests studied, (2) survivors reporting awareness during arrest, (3) survivors who could have seen hidden targets, (4) verified accurate perceptions of targets? What were methodological critiques of the studies, and how did researchers respond? What do neuroscientists consider the strongest alternative explanations for verified perceptions (information leakage, prior knowledge, lucky guesses)?

**Expected Impact**:
If verification rates are statistically significant, strengthens post-materialist case considerably. If near-zero despite large sample, framework must engage why "consciousness independence" doesn't manifest when properly controlled.

**Notes**:
This is framework's empirical linchpin. Must present with full statistical context, success AND failure rates.

---

### [CONSC] Intermission Memory vs. NDE Feature Comparison

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-002, CONSC-004

**Context**:
Framework identifies parallel features between children's "intermission memories" (DOPS research) and NDEs as convergent evidence for post-mortem phenomenology. Need statistical comparison to test whether features genuinely converge or framework is pattern-matching selectively.

**Research Question**:
Comparing DOPS intermission memory reports to NDE phenomenology: What percentage of intermission cases include (1) light/radiant realm, (2) deceased relatives encountered, (3) life planning/mission selection, (4) choice to return vs. being sent back, (5) reluctance to incarnate? Do intermission memories include features NOT common in NDEs (memory erasure, incarnation reluctance, mission assignment)? What are key differences suggesting distinct phenomena vs. overlapping cosmology?

**Expected Impact**:
Strong convergence validates framework's integrated post-mortem model. Significant divergence suggests separate phenomenology requiring different explanations.

**Notes**:
CONSC-002 and CONSC-004 connections claim parallelism. Need quantitative comparison, not impressionistic similarity.

---

### [CONSC] Children's Past-Life Cases: Overall Verification Rates

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-002

**Context**:
Framework emphasizes strongest DOPS cases (Leininger, Hammons) with multiple verified statements. Critical analysis asks: What's overall verification rate across 2,500+ cases? Cherry-picking strongest cases inflates evidential strength. Tucker's methodology needs honest presentation including failures.

**Research Question**:
Of UVA DOPS 2,500+ documented cases: (1) What percentage have ANY verified statements?, (2) What percentage have MULTIPLE (3+) verified statements?, (3) What percentage have physical correspondences (birthmarks matching wounds)?, (4) What percentage lack documentation (previous person not identified)?, (5) How does DOPS handle failed verification attempts—are these published or just successful cases?, (6) What are methodological critiques (information leakage, cryptomnesia, leading questions) and Tucker's responses?, (7) Have independent researchers attempted replication with similar success rates?

**Expected Impact**:
Even 10-20% verification rate would be remarkable if properly controlled. But framework must report full picture. If only handful of 2500 cases verify, evidential weight changes dramatically.

**Notes**:
Identified in critical analysis as evidence overreach. Research question log already has related question; this one focuses specifically on verification statistics across entire dataset.

## DOMAIN 2: SWEDENBORGIAN THEOLOGY — SOURCE VALIDATION GAPS

### [SWED] Swedenborg's Doctrine Evolution Across Corpus

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-001, SWED-004, CROSS-001

**Context**:
Framework applies HCM to Bible (identifying sources, redactions, evolution) but not to Swedenborg. Critical analysis recommends consistency. Need scholarly analysis of development across Swedenborg's theological corpus (1749-1771).

**Research Question**:
How do Swedenborg's core doctrines (correspondences, influx, ruling love, regeneration) evolve from *Arcana Coelestia* (1749-1756) through *Heaven and Hell* (1758) to *Divine Love and Wisdom* (1763) and *True Christian Religion* (1771)? Are there contradictions or revisions? How does his treatment of Ancient Word claim change? Does he become more or less literal about Genesis 1-11 as "made-up history"?

**Expected Impact**:
Shows intellectual honesty—framework applies critical methods to ALL texts. May reveal development suggesting Swedenborg refined theology over time (normal for any thinker).

**Notes**:
Sensitive but necessary for epistemological consistency. See critical analysis Action 1.3 and framework improvement plan. NotebookLM limit requires focused, specific query.

### [SWED] Swedenborg's 18th-Century Intellectual Context

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-001, SWED-004

**Context**:
Framework presents Swedenborg's correspondences as revelatory spiritual perception. Critical analysis notes: all thinkers are culturally situated. Understanding 18th-century influences doesn't negate spiritual authority but shows how revelation works THROUGH cultural context, not independent of it (parallel to biblical authors).

**Research Question**:
What intellectual traditions influenced Swedenborg's theological system? Analyze: (1) Swedish Lutheran pietism and mysticism in 1700s, (2) Cartesian mind-body dualism (Swedenborg was scientist), (3) Neoplatonic emanation theories available in his era, (4) What exposure did Swedenborg have to Kabbalistic traditions?, (5) How do his correspondences relate to earlier Christian mystical interpretation (Paracelsus, Boehme, medieval allegory)?, (6) Enlightenment rationalism's influence on his systematic theology approach?, (7) Were "symbolic interpretation of sacred texts" traditions already existing that Swedenborg systematized?

**Expected Impact**:
Places Swedenborg in intellectual history without diminishing revelatory status. Shows how divine influx works through cultural forms. Strengthens framework by demonstrating methodological consistency.

**Notes**:
See framework improvement plan Action 1.3, Option A. This is extended research needing full GDR context.

### [SWED] Independent Validation of Correspondence Claims

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-001, CROSS-001

**Context**:
Critical analysis identifies circular reasoning: "Swedenborg says Exodus = regeneration → We find regeneration in Exodus → Therefore Swedenborg validated." Framework needs independent methodology for distinguishing true correspondences from invented ones. This is unfalsifiability problem at core of framework.

**Research Question**:
Is there ANY methodology for validating correspondential interpretations that doesn't presuppose Swedenborg's authority? Investigate: (1) What criteria distinguish legitimate symbolic reading from arbitrary allegory?, (2) Historical-critical scholars identify "authorial intent" through source analysis—can this validate/challenge correspondences?, (3) Do pre-Swedenborgian Jewish/Christian allegorical traditions identify same correspondences independently?, (4) Comparative mythology: do symbolic patterns Swedenborg identifies appear cross-culturally (suggesting universal archetypes) or only in Hebrew Bible?, (5) Can correspondences make testable predictions? (e.g., "If passage X corresponds to spiritual state Y, redaction criticism should show composition in historical context matching Y")

**Expected Impact**:
If independent validation methods exist, dramatically strengthens framework. If unfalsifiable by design, framework must acknowledge this is theological hermeneutic, not empirically validated epistemology.

**Notes**:
This is THE critical epistemological question. See critical analysis Section 1 and falsifiability analysis action item. Requires sophisticated research.

### [SWED] Most Ancient Church: Archaeological Evidence vs. Golden Age Fallacy

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-006, SWED-004

**Context**:
Knowledge graph SWED-006 caveats note "Risk of Golden Age fallacy—archaeological evidence shows cognitive progress, not decline." Framework reinterprets Swedenborg's "Most Ancient Church" as allegory for cognitive architecture, not literal recent history. Need scholarly assessment of this move.

**Research Question**:
What does archaeological/paleoanthropological evidence show about cognitive evolution from Lower Paleolithic through Neolithic? Specifically: (1) Evidence for symbolic thought (art, burial, ornament) over time—increasing or stable?, (2) Social complexity and cooperation—becoming more sophisticated or degrading?, (3) "Golden Age" claims in history: are they universal myth reflecting nostalgia rather than fact?, (4) Swedenborg's literal claim of recent (4000-5000 BCE) Most Ancient Church in Near East—does this match or contradict archaeological record?, (5) Is framework's reinterpretation (allegorical cognitive architecture vs. literal history) defensible while still claiming Swedenborg's authority?

**Expected Impact**:
If archaeological record contradicts literal Golden Age, framework's allegorical reinterpretation is necessary but raises questions about selective literalism. If evidence ambiguous, framework has more flexibility.

**Notes**:
Knowledge graph already includes caveats. Research determines whether allegorical reading is apologetic retrofit or genuinely supported by Swedenborg's own writings.

---

## DOMAIN 3: BIBLICAL SCHOLARSHIP — METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR GAPS

### [BIBL] Gospel Embarrassment Criterion: Current Scholarly Assessment

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: BIBL-002, EARLY-003

**Context**:
Framework uses embarrassment criterion to identify authentic Jesus material vs. Pauline overlay. "Re-evaluating Gospel Embarrassment.md" exists in data. Need current scholarly status of this criterion—has it been challenged or refined?

**Research Question**:
What is current status of "criterion of embarrassment" in historical Jesus research? Specifically: (1) Do majority of scholars still consider it valid?, (2) What are main critiques (e.g., "embarrassing to whom? Later church or original community?")?, (3) How do scholars handle cases where "embarrassment" might be rhetorical strategy (e.g., humility claims establishing authority)?, (4) Examples where criterion has been challenged on specific passages?, (5) Alternative criteria that have superseded or supplemented embarrassment in contemporary scholarship?

**Expected Impact**:
If criterion remains robust, strengthens framework's Jesus-Paul divergence analysis. If widely challenged, framework must use more sophisticated methods.

**Notes**:
Data file suggests framework is aware of complexities. Research determines whether usage is defensible or needs revision.

---

### [BIBL] Lukan Redaction of Q and Proto-Luke Material

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-002, BIBL-001

**Context**:
Framework proposes Proto-Luke as Jamesian source. But Luke-Acts heavily redacts sources (removes Davidic emphasis, Hellenizes Jesus). How much original Jamesian material survived? Can we distinguish Jamesian substrate from Lukan theology?

**Research Question**:
What criteria do scholars use to distinguish Lukan redaction from pre-Lukan sources in Q and L material? Can "de-redaction" reliably recover earlier forms? What are limits of source criticism—how much uncertainty exists? Specifically for Jamesian protograph hypothesis: what textual evidence would validate vs. falsify it?

**Expected Impact**:
Determines confidence level for Proto-Luke hypothesis. If source criticism is highly uncertain, hypothesis must be marked speculative. If methods robust, framework justified in using it.

**Notes**:
Knowledge graph EARLY-002 acknowledges "hypothesis stacked on hypothesis" with low confidence. Research determines appropriate uncertainty level.

---

### [BIBL] Western Non-Interpolations: Scholarly Consensus

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Low  
**Related Nodes**: BIBL-007

**Context**:
Framework references Westcott-Hort's "Western Non-Interpolations"—passages in Alexandrian manuscripts absent from Western tradition, suggesting Western deletions rather than Alexandrian additions. Need current scholarly status.

**Research Question**:
Do contemporary textual critics accept Westcott-Hort's Western Non-Interpolations category? What's the current explanation for these variants? Have NA28/UBS5 editions retained or revised W-H's judgments? Which specific passages are most debated?

**Expected Impact**:
Minor—ensures framework uses current textual scholarship rather than 19th-century assumptions.

**Notes**:
Low priority but relevant for scholarly credibility. NotebookLM query appropriate for technical detail.

---

## DOMAIN 4: EARLY CHRISTIAN HISTORY — HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION GAPS

### [EARLY] Jamesian Protograph: Textual Evidence vs. Theological Inference

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-002, EARLY-010

**Context**:
Framework presents "Jamesian protograph" underlying Proto-Luke as significant source. Knowledge graph acknowledges "hypothesis stacked on hypothesis" (Markan priority → Q → L → Proto-Luke → Jamesian attribution) with low confidence. Critical analysis questions whether this is scholarly hypothesis or framework's theological inference.

**Research Question**:
What is the textual evidence specifically for Jamesian authorship or community of Proto-Luke material? Investigate: (1) Does mainstream NT scholarship attribute any pre-Lukan sources to James or Jerusalem church?, (2) Is "Jamesian protograph" a hypothesis in scholarly literature or framework's designation?, (3) What features (law-observance, Davidic emphasis, poor/rich polarity) actually correlate with James's theology vs. general Jewish Christianity?, (4) Could L material derive from other Jewish-Christian communities besides James's circle?, (5) How does Klinghardt's Marcionite hypothesis (contested minority view) relate to Jamesian protograph theory?, (6) What would constitute textual evidence that would falsify Jamesian attribution?

**Expected Impact**:
If "Jamesian protograph" is framework's inference rather than scholarly hypothesis, must be clearly marked as interpretive. If scholarly support exists, determines appropriate confidence level.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis Section 14C. This is crucial for framework's Jesus-Paul divergence argument. Must distinguish established from speculative.

---

### [EARLY] Desposyni Dynastic Claims: Historical Evidence

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-007, EARLY-010

**Context**:
Framework presents Desposyni (Jesus's biological family) as dynastic leaders of early church into 4th century. Relies on Eusebius, Hegesippus, Epiphanius. Need assessment of source reliability and scholarly consensus on these claims.

**Research Question**:
What is scholarly consensus on Desposyni leadership claims? Analyze: (1) How historically reliable are Hegesippus and Epiphanius (writing 2nd-3rd centuries about 1st-century events)?, (2) Are there independent corroborations of dynastic succession beyond these sources?, (3) What evidence exists for biological descendants of Jesus leading churches outside Jerusalem?, (4) How does this interact with Davidic lineage claims—were Desposyni asserting messianic royal authority?, (5) Why would imperial church tolerate rival authority structure until Sylvester I (318 CE)—what changed?, (6) Is the 318 CE delegation story to Sylvester historically credible or legendary?

**Expected Impact**:
If Desposyni claims are contested or based on unreliable late sources, framework must mark as speculative. If scholarly support exists, strengthens Jesus-Paul divergence narrative.

**Notes**:
EARLY-007 has trace_status: partial. Need external scholarly assessment, not just patristic citations.

### [EARLY] Magi as Persian Priests: Zoroastrian Connection Evidence

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Low  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-008, EARLY-009

**Context**:
Framework proposes Magi were authentic Persian Zoroastrian priests who recognized Jesus through astronomical prophecy, bringing Avestan wisdom into Christianity. Data includes "Persian Roots of Early Christianity.md" and "The Cycle of Celestial Knowledge.md". Need scholarly assessment.

**Research Question**:
What evidence supports Matthean Magi as historical Zoroastrian priests vs. Matthean literary creation? Investigate: (1) Dating of Zoroastrian texts—do they predate Christianity or are they later compilations?, (2) Specific Zoroastrian doctrines (Saoshyant savior, resurrection, final judgment) that parallel Christianity—direction of influence?, (3) Matthew's Magi narrative: scholarly consensus on historicity vs. theological symbolism?, (4) If Magi were historical, could they have been Jewish Babylonian exiles rather than Zoroastrians?, (5) What is mainstream scholarship on Persian influence on Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity?

**Expected Impact**:
If Zoroastrian-Christian connection is well-established, fascinating historical insight. If speculative or direction of influence unclear, framework must present more tentatively.

**Notes**:
Interesting but peripheral to core framework. Low priority. Data documents suggest substantial research already done—need external validation.

### [EARLY] Paul's Damascus Vision: Scholarly Explanations

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-003, GNOS-003

**Context**:
Framework treats Paul's Damascus vision as genuine spiritual experience but interprets it through proprium lens (Paul's subjective construction). "Paul's Damascus Vision: Scholarly Critique.md" exists in data. Need current neurological and psychological scholarship.

**Research Question**:
What explanations do scholars offer for Paul's Damascus vision? Analyze: (1) Neurological hypotheses (temporal lobe epilepsy, photosensitive migraine, heat stroke), (2) Psychological explanations (guilt-induced hallucination, conversion psychology), (3) How do scholars distinguish "genuine religious experience" from pathological explanations?, (4) What's the relationship between Acts accounts (3 versions with contradictions) and Paul's own testimony (Gal 1, 1 Cor 9, 15)?, (5) Does framework's "subjective proprium construction" interpretation have scholarly parallels?

**Expected Impact**:
Framework doesn't need to adopt naturalist explanations, but should engage them. Shows scholarly awareness even while maintaining theological interpretation.

**Notes**:
Data file "Paul's Damascus Vision_ Scholarly Critique.md" suggests engagement already. Research confirms framework uses current scholarship.

## DOMAIN 5: GNOSTIC ANALYSIS — CATEGORY DEFINITION GAPS

### [GNOS] "Gnostic Impulse" Category: Historical Heterogeneity

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: GNOS-001, GNOS-004, GNOS-006

**Context**:
Critical analysis Section 8 identifies "Gnostic Impulse" as problematic category encompassing radically heterogeneous phenomena (ancient Valentinianism, SBNR spirituality, simulation hypothesis, UFO religions). Functions as polemical catch-all for positions framework opposes. Risks anachronism and essentialism.

**Research Question**:
How do scholars of Gnosticism define "gnostic" as historical movement vs. typological category? Investigate: (1) Michael Williams's critique in *Rethinking "Gnosticism"*—why he argues category is incoherent, (2) Karen King's *What is Gnosticism?*—problems with applying modern construct to ancient diversity, (3) Is "gnostic impulse" a recognized scholarly category or framework's neologism?, (4) What structural features MUST be present for something to be "gnostic" (material evil? divine spark? Demiurge? secret knowledge?)—do modern SBNR movements meet these criteria?, (5) Could framework's pattern be better described as "anti-institutionalism" or "autonomous spirituality" without gnostic baggage?

**Expected Impact**:
If scholarly consensus is moving away from "gnostic" as transhistorical category, framework needs tighter definition or different terminology. If structural parallels are robust, usage defended.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis Section 8 and Action 2.3 in improvement plan. High priority—affects large swath of framework's polemical architecture.

### [GNOS] Paul as Proto-Gnostic: Mainstream vs. Framework Position

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: GNOS-003, GNOS-005, EARLY-003

**Context**:
Framework identifies "gnostic substrate" in Paul (cosmic drama, flesh/spirit dualism, hidden wisdom, mysterion language). Knowledge graph GNOS-003 acknowledges this is minority view—mainstream situates Paul in Jewish apocalypticism. Critical analysis notes cherry-picking: Paul's bodily resurrection theology and creation affirmation contradict gnostic cosmology.

**Research Question**:
What is mainstream NT scholarship's position on Paul's relationship to Gnosticism? Specifically: (1) Do scholars see Paul as proto-gnostic, Jewish apocalyptic, or something else?, (2) How do scholars explain Valentinian use of Paul—influence from Paul or gnostic reading imposed on Paul?, (3) What are strongest arguments AGAINST gnostic Paul (e.g., 1 Cor 15 bodily resurrection, Romans 8 creation groaning)?, (4) How do scholars interpret Paul's "wisdom/foolishness" dichotomy—is this gnostic dualism or prophetic critique?, (5) Does Pastoral Epistles' "falsely called gnosis" (1 Tim 6:20) suggest early orthodox reading saw Paul as ANTI-gnostic?, (6) What is scholarly assessment of framework's selective emphasis on dualist passages while downplaying resurrection/creation passages?

**Expected Impact**:
If mainstream firmly rejects gnostic Paul, framework must present this as theological interpretation, not historical consensus. If debate exists, appropriate to explore but with clear uncertainty markers.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis Sections 5A and 9. Knowledge graph GNOS-003 includes caveats but framework documents may overstate case. Research determines appropriate confidence level.

## DOMAIN 6: MYTHOLOGICAL STUDIES — EVIDENTIAL RIGOR GAPS

### [MYTH] Oral Tradition Stability: Songlines vs. Narrative Content

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: MYTH-008, SWED-004

**Context**:
Framework cites Aboriginal songlines preserving "14,000-year narratives" as evidence oral traditions could preserve Ancient Word. Critical analysis Section 4B notes: preserving geographic/ecological information ≠ narrative content remaining unchanged. Need linguistic/anthropological research on oral tradition drift vs. stability.

**Research Question**:
What is scholarly consensus on stability vs. drift in oral traditions over millennia? Investigate: (1) Jack Goody's work on oral vs. literate cultures—how does transmission fidelity differ?, (2) Studies of oral traditions in non-literate societies (Polynesian, African, Native American)—documented drift over generations?, (3) Australian Aboriginal songlines specifically: what's preserved (geographic routes, ecological knowledge, ritual sequences) vs. what varies (narrative elaboration, mythic details)?, (4) Difference between preserving spatial/ecological information (landmark navigation) vs. preserving specific narrative content (plot, characterization, theological meaning)?, (5) Is 10,000+ year narrative stability plausible or is framework romanticizing oral tradition?, (6) How does framework's Ancient Word hypothesis differ from universal cognitive archetypes (Jung) or convergent mythmaking (natural, not influx-driven)?

**Expected Impact**:
Critical for Ancient Word hypothesis. If oral traditions show substantial narrative drift, claim of 10,000-year stable correspondence system weakens dramatically. If spatial memory differs from narrative memory, framework must distinguish claims.

**Notes**:
Already in research question log but worth expanding. This is empirical test of unfalsifiable theological claim (Ancient Word). Research determines plausibility.

### [MYTH] Göbekli Tepe Astronomical Interpretation: Archaeological Consensus

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: MYTH-008, SWED-004

**Context**:
Framework cites Göbekli Tepe (11,600 BP) as potential astronomical observatory encoding Younger Dryas cataclysm, supporting Ancient Word hypothesis. This comes from Martin Sweatman's work. Need scholarly assessment—is this mainstream archaeology or fringe theory?

**Research Question**:
What is archaeological consensus on Göbekli Tepe's function and symbolism? Specifically: (1) Is Martin Sweatman's astronomical interpretation (Pillar 43 as star map, Younger Dryas comet) accepted by mainstream archaeologists or considered speculative?, (2) What do excavators (Klaus Schmidt, Lee Clare) say about site's purpose?, (3) Alternative interpretations of the iconography that don't require astronomical knowledge?, (4) If astronomical, does this prove transmission of specific narrative content or just observation of celestial events?, (5) How does this compare to other Neolithic sites—is Göbekli Tepe unique or part of broader pattern?, (6) What is scholarly assessment of "lost advanced civilization" theories that use Göbekli Tepe as evidence?

**Expected Impact**:
If mainstream archaeology skeptical of astronomical interpretation, framework must present more tentatively. If accepted, strengthens Ancient Word plausibility.

**Notes**:
MYTH-008 cites this as evidence. Göbekli Tepe is often used by alternative history proponents (Graham Hancock)—framework must distinguish legitimate scholarship from fringe.

### [MYTH] Proto-Myth Divergence: Traceable Evidence vs. Theoretical Construct

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: MYTH-002, MYTH-005, MYTH-006

**Context**:
Framework proposes proto-myths diverged into opposing trajectories ("Heart of Division" vs. "Heart of Unity") driven by consciousness evolution. This is elegant theoretical model—but is there empirical way to trace actual historical divergence, or is this unfalsifiable interpretive framework?

**Research Question**:
How do comparative mythologists trace genetic relationships between myths? Investigate: (1) Linguistic methods for reconstructing proto-myths (parallel to proto-Indo-European language reconstruction), (2) Can we date divergences—when did Genesis creation narrative branch from Enuma Elish traditions?, (3) What is scholarly assessment of "binary divergence" model—do myths split into opposing pairs or show more complex diffusion patterns?, (4) Evidence for borrowing/influence vs. common ancestry—how do scholars distinguish?, (5) Could similar mythic patterns result from universal human cognition (cognitive science of religion) rather than historical divergence from common source?, (6) What would constitute evidence for vs. against framework's CDE-driven divergence?

**Expected Impact**:
Determines whether proto-myth analysis is empirically grounded or theologically imposed pattern. If methods exist for tracing divergence, framework on solid ground. If unfalsifiable, mark as interpretive.

**Notes**:
MYTH-002, MYTH-005 (Enuma Elish), MYTH-006 (Genesis) develop this extensively. Research determines scholarly support.

## DOMAIN 7: CROSS-DOMAIN & METHODOLOGICAL — FUNDAMENTAL GAPS

### [CROSS] CDE vs. Dual Inheritance Theory: Comparative Predictions

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-001, CROSS-003

**Context**:
Critical analysis Section 2B identifies simpler alternative explanations for cultural evolution patterns: Boyd & Richerson's Dual Inheritance Theory, Wilson's Cultural Group Selection. These explain cooperation/conflict without metaphysical "consciousness as causal force." Framework needs to show CDE adds unique explanatory/predictive power vs. these simpler theories.

**Research Question**:
How do Dual Inheritance Theory and Cultural Group Selection explain cultural evolution? Specifically: (1) What predictions do Boyd & Richerson's DIT make about when cooperative vs. competitive strategies dominate?, (2) How does CGS explain prosocial norm emergence without invoking consciousness-as-fundamental?, (3) Do these theories require consciousness as causal driver or treat it as epiphenomenal correlate?, (4) What testable predictions does CDE make that DIT/CGS cannot explain?, (5) If framework's "ruling love polarity" is reframed as "cooperation/defection strategies," does CDE add anything beyond standard evolutionary game theory?, (6) Can ANY cultural trajectory falsify CDE, or does it explain all outcomes post-hoc?

**Expected Impact**:
This is Occam's Razor test. If simpler theories explain same data, burden is on framework to show why metaphysical addition is necessary. If CDE makes unique testable predictions, it's legitimate competing hypothesis. If not, it's theological interpretation of naturalist explanations.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis Section 2B and already in research question log. Central epistemological issue. Requires sophisticated analysis—use GDR extended context.

### [CROSS] Dying Brain Hypothesis: Strongest Current Evidence

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-004

**Context**:
Framework interprets NDEs as evidence for post-mortem consciousness. Critical analysis Section 7A: framework doesn't adequately engage strongest neuroscientific alternatives. Must address dying brain explanations seriously, not dismissively, to maintain intellectual credibility.

**Research Question**:
What is current state of neuroscientific explanations for NDE phenomenology? Specifically: (1) Borjigin et al. (2013) findings on surge of gamma brain activity at death in rats—implications for human consciousness?, (2) DMT hypothesis (Strassman)—is endogenous DMT released at death? What's evidence?, (3) Temporal lobe models for life review (memory cascade during oxygen deprivation), (4) Visual cortex anoxia explanations for tunnel/light perception, (5) How do neuroscientists explain veridical perception cases—information leakage? Prior knowledge? Statistical artifacts?, (6) What are strongest counterarguments neuroscientists offer to "consciousness survives death" interpretation?, (7) Has anyone proposed naturalist explanation for empathetic life review component?

**Expected Impact**:
Framework strengthened by engaging best alternatives seriously. If dying brain models are weak, shows why post-materialist interpretation needed. If strong, framework must articulate why insufficient despite plausibility.

**Notes**:
Already in research question log. Critical analysis emphasizes this as intellectual honesty requirement. Framework can maintain post-materialist position while acknowledging strength of alternatives.

### [CROSS] Falsification Criteria for Correspondence Doctrine

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-001, CROSS-001

**Context**:
Critical analysis Section 1B: correspondence doctrine is unfalsifiable by design. Framework acknowledges this in knowledge graph but still claims "epistemological integration." Need clear answer: what would falsify Swedenborgian correspondences? If nothing, this is faith commitment, not validated knowledge.

**Research Question**:
Can correspondence doctrine be falsified? Investigate: (1) What would Swedenborg himself say constitutes false vs. true correspondence?, (2) Historical cases where correspondence interpretations were abandoned as incorrect, (3) Do different Swedenborgian scholars disagree on specific correspondences—if so, how is disagreement resolved?, (4) Could historical-critical findings ever force revision of correspondence (e.g., if source criticism shows text composite, does this affect spiritual sense?)?, (5) If answer is "correspondences cannot be falsified," how does framework defend calling this epistemology rather than hermeneutics?, (6) Is framework willing to acknowledge correspondence doctrine as faith commitment rather than validated claim?

**Expected Impact**:
Central epistemological question. If falsification criteria exist, framework on stronger ground. If admitted as unfalsifiable, requires reframing entire epistemological stance per critical analysis recommendations.

**Notes**:
THE crucial question for framework's intellectual honesty. See critical analysis Section 1, critical issues summary, falsifiability analysis action plan. This research determines whether fundamental reframing necessary.

### [CROSS] Historical-Critical Method Applied to Swedenborg: Feasibility

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CROSS-001, SWED-001

**Context**:
Critical analysis Section 1C identifies methodological asymmetry: HCM applied to Bible but not Swedenborg. Framework improvement plan Action 1.3 offers two options: (A) apply HCM to Swedenborg, or (B) acknowledge asymmetry as theological stance. Need research to determine if Option A is feasible.

**Research Question**:
Has anyone attempted historical-critical analysis of Swedenborg's theological writings? Investigate: (1) Scholarly work on Swedenborg's biography, spiritual crisis (1740s), vision experiences, (2) Analysis of Swedenborg's theological development across works (evolution of doctrines), (3) Identification of Swedenborg's sources (which earlier mystics, philosophers, theologians influenced him?), (4) Psychological explanations for visions (neurological, psychiatric, genuine mystical?), (5) How do New Church scholars handle contradictions or problematic passages in Swedenborg?, (6) Would critical analysis of Swedenborg necessarily undermine framework, or can it show how revelation works THROUGH cultural context (parallel to biblical inspiration)?

**Expected Impact**:
If scholarship exists, framework can engage it honestly. Option A (apply HCM to Swedenborg) becomes feasible and strengthens methodological consistency. If scholarship thin or would require original research beyond framework scope, Option B (acknowledge asymmetry) more practical.

**Notes**:
High priority for epistemological integrity. See critical analysis Section 1C and Action 1.3. Sensitive topic but necessary for intellectual honesty.

## DOMAIN 8: EVIDENCE PRESENTATION — CHERRY-PICKING & BALANCE GAPS

### [EARLY] Paul's Humility vs. Authority: Balanced Scholarly Assessment

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-003, SWED-005, GNOS-003

**Context**:
Already in research question log. Critical analysis Sections 5A and 9 note framework selectively emphasizes confrontational Paul (authority claims, confronting Peter) while downplaying humble Paul ("slave of Christ," "least of apostles," weakness boasting). How do scholars interpret this?

**Research Question**:
How do Pauline scholars interpret passages where Paul describes himself with extreme humility? Examples: (1) "Slave of Christ" (δοῦλος Χριστοῦ), (2) "Least of the apostles" (1 Cor 15:9), (3) Weakness boasting (2 Cor 11-12), (4) Suffering catalogues (2 Cor 6:4-10). Do scholars see these as: (a) Authentic humility (Paul's genuine self-perception), (b) Rhetorical strategy (establishing authority paradoxically through humility), (c) Mixed: Sincere humility alongside prophetic zeal? How does this complicate framework's "proprium" diagnosis?

**Expected Impact**:
Framework must engage full Paul, not just confirming passages. If scholars see authentic humility, "proprium" interpretation requires nuancing or revision.

**Notes**:
Already logged. Including here for completeness. NotebookLM query—needs concise formulation.

### [CONSC] NDE Cultural Variation: Being of Light Identification

**Target**: `[NDE]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CONSC-004

**Context**:
Already in research question log. Critical analysis Section 7B challenges framework's "pure identification" claim (atheists identifying being as Jesus based on personality match). Selection bias: most studies in Christian-majority cultures. Expectation effects.

**Research Question**:
In NDEs from Hindu-majority, Buddhist-majority, and Islamic-majority populations, what percentage of experiencers identify the "Being of Light" encountered as: (1) Jesus Christ, (2) Deities from their cultural tradition (Krishna, Yamaraj, Buddha, etc.), (3) Generic "deceased relatives" or unnamed beings, (4) No being encountered. Does personality-based identification transcend cultural conditioning, or do experiencers interpret the encounter through pre-existing religious frameworks?

**Expected Impact**:
If Hindu NDErs predominantly report Hindu deities rather than Jesus, framework's "pure identification" claim requires revision. If Jesus appears cross-culturally, remarkable evidence for framework.

**Notes**:
Already logged. Critical for framework's NDE interpretation. Statistical repository should have cross-cultural data.

## DOMAIN 9: UNDERREPRESENTED DOMAINS — EXPANSION NEEDS

### [BIBL] Synoptic Problem Solutions: Current Scholarly Distribution

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: BIBL-001, BIBL-002

**Context**:
Framework relies on Markan priority and Q hypothesis for source analysis. Knowledge graph shows Biblical Scholarship domain is underrepresented (13 nodes, 12%) compared to Swedenborgian Theology (33 nodes, 29%). Need current scholarly consensus on Synoptic Problem to ensure framework uses mainstream solutions.

**Research Question**:
What percentage of NT scholars accept: (1) Markan priority (Mark written first), (2) Q hypothesis (sayings source used by Matthew/Luke), (3) Farrer hypothesis (Luke used Matthew, no Q needed), (4) Griesbach hypothesis (Matthew first, Mark conflation), (5) Other solutions? Has consensus shifted in recent decades? What are strongest arguments for/against Q? Does framework's source analysis depend critically on Q existing, or can it work with alternative solutions?

**Expected Impact**:
Ensures framework uses current scholarly consensus. If Q is contested, source analysis requiring Q should be marked tentative.

**Notes**:
Biblical Scholarship domain underrepresented per prompt statistics. This question expands BIBL nodes with fundamental source-critical information.

### [BIBL] Gospel Genre and Historiographical Standards

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: BIBL-002

**Context**:
Framework references Richard Burridge's work identifying Gospels as *bioi* (ancient biography). This affects historical expectations—ancient biography allowed theological shaping, not modern journalistic accuracy. Need clarity on what this means for historicity claims.

**Research Question**:
How do scholars define Gospel genre as ancient biography (*bioi*)? What historiographical standards did ancient *bioi* follow—verbatim accuracy, thematic accuracy, theological shaping? How does this affect assessment of Gospel historical reliability? Specifically: if Gospels are *bioi*, does this validate or challenge framework's use of embarrassment criterion and source criticism to reconstruct "authentic Jesus"?

**Expected Impact**:
Affects confidence in historical reconstructions. If *bioi* genre allowed substantial creative shaping, historical Jesus reconstruction becomes more uncertain.

**Notes**:
Biblical Scholarship expansion. Framework references Burridge but implications for historicity need clarity.

### [GNOS] Desert Fathers' Philautia vs. Swedenborg's Proprium

**Target**: `[NLM]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Low  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-005, GNOS-001

**Context**:
Knowledge graph SWED-005 evidence includes "Desert Fathers identified philautia as root of passions." Framework equates this with Swedenborg's proprium. Need verification and analysis of relationship.

**Research Question**:
What did Desert Fathers (Evagrius, Cassian) teach about *philautia* (self-love)? How does it relate to their teaching on passions (*logismoi*)? What's the relationship to pride (*hyperēphania*) vs. self-love specifically? How similar/different is this to Swedenborg's proprium doctrine?

**Expected Impact**:
Minor—validates connection or shows framework is overstating patristic parallel. Strengthens historical grounding of proprium concept.

**Notes**:
Gnostic Analysis domain underrepresented (9 nodes, 8%). This expands with patristic connection validation.

### [GNOS] "I AM God" Mechanic in Modern Spirituality: Empirical Survey

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: GNOS-004, GNOS-006

**Context**:
Framework identifies "I AM God" mechanic in modern SBNR movements, New Age, channeled systems. Claims this is proprium self-deification. Need empirical data on prevalence of this belief in contemporary spirituality.

**Research Question**:
What percentage of SBNR-identified individuals hold beliefs matching "gnostic impulse" pattern: (1) "I am divine/God," (2) "Material world is illusion/prison," (3) "Salvation through gnosis/awakening," (4) "Reject external moral authority"? Are these beliefs statistically clustered (one dimensional trait) or independent? How do sociologists of religion classify contemporary spirituality—do they recognize "gnostic" pattern or see more heterogeneity? What are demographic predictors of these beliefs?

**Expected Impact**:
If "gnostic impulse" is empirically identifiable pattern in modern spirituality, validates framework's category. If beliefs show no clustering, framework may be imposing pattern on diverse phenomena.

**Notes**:
Strengthens Gnostic Analysis domain with empirical data. Addresses critical analysis Section 8 concern about category overreach.

### [CROSS] Two-Tiered Epistemology: Philosophical Assessment

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CROSS-001

**Context**:
Critical analysis Section 1A: framework conflates hermeneutic interpretation with epistemological integration. "This is hermeneutics, not epistemology." Framework claims "two-tiered epistemology" but operates as theological overlay on accepted scientific findings. Need philosophical analysis.

**Research Question**:
How do philosophers of science and epistemologists assess "dual epistemology" or "complementary ways of knowing" claims? Investigate: (1) Stephen Jay Gould's "Non-Overlapping Magisteria" (NOMA)—scholarly reception and critiques, (2) Critical realist philosophy (Roy Bhaskar, Alister McGrath)—stratified ontology with multiple levels, (3) What distinguishes epistemology (method of knowledge justification) from hermeneutics (method of interpretation)?, (4) Can theological interpretation of scientific findings constitute epistemology, or is it fundamentally hermeneutic?, (5) What would framework need to demonstrate to claim genuine "epistemological integration" rather than "interpretive overlay"?, (6) Are there successful models of faith-reason integration that avoid unfalsifiability trap?

**Expected Impact**:
Central to framework's self-understanding. If philosophical analysis shows framework is hermeneutic stance (not epistemology), requires fundamental reframing per critical analysis recommendations.

**Notes**:
THE key philosophical question. Cross-domain expansion addressing core framework claim. See critical analysis Section 1, falsifiability analysis.

## DOMAIN 10: COMPARATIVE & VALIDATION — EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE GAPS

### [MYTH] Memory Code Hypothesis: Scholarly Reception

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: MYTH-003, MYTH-008, SWED-006

**Context**:
Framework cites Lynne Kelly's "Memory Code" hypothesis linking monuments to mnemonic technology. MYTH-008 and SWED-006 reference this as parallel to Swedenborg's Most Ancient Church cognitive state. Need scholarly assessment of Kelly's work.

**Research Question**:
What is academic reception of Lynne Kelly's Memory Code hypothesis? Investigate: (1) Has her work been peer-reviewed in archaeological/anthropological journals?, (2) Do mainstream archaeologists accept monuments-as-mnemonic-devices interpretation for Stonehenge, Göbekli Tepe, etc.?, (3) What evidence supports vs. challenges the hypothesis?, (4) How does Memory Code differ from or relate to "oral tradition" stability research?, (5) If mnemonic monuments did encode information, what types (genealogy, ritual sequences, astronomical observations) vs. theological narratives?, (6) Does Memory Code support Ancient Word hypothesis or offer naturalist alternative?

**Expected Impact**:
If Kelly's work is mainstream, strengthens framework's cognitive technology claims. If fringe or contested, framework must present more tentatively.

**Notes**:
Mythological Studies domain at 16 nodes (14%)—good coverage. This validates existing node MYTH-003.

### [MYTH] Enuma Elish and Genesis: Direction of Influence

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: MYTH-005, MYTH-006

**Context**:
Framework extensively analyzes Genesis/Enuma Elish parallels, proposing proto-myth divergence into "Heart of Division" vs. "Heart of Unity." Need scholarly consensus on historical relationship—borrowing, common source, or independent development?

**Research Question**:
What is scholarly consensus on relationship between Genesis creation accounts and Enuma Elish? Specifically: (1) Dating: Is Enuma Elish older than Genesis 1-11 (usually dated to exilic/post-exilic period)?, (2) Did Israelite authors know Babylonian myths during exile?, (3) Is relationship borrowing-and-subversion (Genesis deliberately countering Babylonian cosmology) or common ancient Near Eastern worldview?, (4) What about Genesis 1 vs. Genesis 2-3—different relationships to ANE myths?, (5) How do scholars explain parallels (flood, creation by divine word, separation of waters)—genetic relationship or cognitive universals?, (6) Is framework's "proto-myth divergence" model supported or is simpler explanation sufficient?

**Expected Impact**:
Determines whether proto-myth theory is necessary or framework is over-interpreting natural parallels. If scholars see borrowing-and-subversion, framework's "Heart of Unity" interpretation validated. If independent development, CDE-driven divergence unnecessary.

**Notes**:
Mythological Studies validation. MYTH-005 and MYTH-006 develop this extensively—need external scholarly check.

### [EARLY] Jesus vs. Paul Incompatibility: Scholarly Consensus

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-003, EARLY-001

**Context**:
Framework presents "foundational divergence" between Jesus's teaching and Paul's theology as historical fact. Critical analysis Section 9 notes this reads as polemic—framework selectively emphasizes discontinuity while downplaying continuity. Need balanced scholarly assessment.

**Research Question**:
What is range of scholarly opinion on Jesus-Paul continuity vs. discontinuity? Investigate: (1) Scholars who emphasize continuity (Paul preserves Jesus's message)—main arguments, (2) Scholars who emphasize discontinuity (Paul invents Christianity)—main arguments, (3) How do scholars handle apparent differences (Kingdom of God vs. Christ-centered theology, Torah observance, justification by faith)?, (4) Is "incompatibility" framework's theological judgment or widely recognized historical problem?, (5) Alternative explanations: Paul adapting Jesus for Gentile context (contextual, not ideological difference)?, (6) How do scholars assess Epistle of James as potential critique of Pauline theology?, (7) Do scholars see Jamesian vs. Pauline movements as irreconcilable or as spectrum within early diversity?

**Expected Impact**:
If scholarly consensus sees continuity, framework's "foundational divergence" thesis is theological interpretation, not historical consensus. If debate exists, framework position is legitimate but must acknowledge alternative views.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis Section 9 and Action 2.4. Early Christian History domain adequately represented (17 nodes, 15%) but this validates core framework claim.

### [EARLY] Talpiot Tomb Statistical Analysis: Current Assessment

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Low  
**Related Nodes**: EARLY-011, BIBL-008

**Context**:
Framework references Talpiot tomb identification (Jesus, Mariamene, DNA evidence). Knowledge graph EARLY-011 acknowledges "highly contested." Need current scholarly assessment of Feuerverger's statistical methods and tomb identification claims.

**Research Question**:
What is scholarly consensus on Talpiot tomb identification? Investigate: (1) Andrey Feuerverger's statistical analysis claiming 600:1 odds favoring Jesus family tomb—critiques?, (2) How do archaeologists assess name commonality arguments (Yeshua, Mariamene, Yosef were common names)?, (3) What's the status of DNA evidence (non-maternal relationship between "Yeshua" and "Mariamene" ossuaries)?, (4) Why do most scholars reject tomb identification despite statistical/DNA claims?, (5) Is framework treating this as validated evidence or speculative possibility?, (6) If speculative, does framework acknowledge appropriate uncertainty?

**Expected Impact**:
Low impact—peripheral to core framework. But if framework overstates Talpiot evidence, marks need for confidence revision.

**Notes**:
EARLY-011 caveats show awareness of controversy. Research confirms framework presentation is appropriately tentative.

### [MYTH] Proto-Indo-European Reconstruction: Methodology as Model

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Low  
**Related Nodes**: MYTH-002, MYTH-008

**Context**:
Framework proposes tracing proto-myths through comparative analysis. Historical linguistics successfully reconstructs proto-languages (PIE) through systematic sound correspondences. Could similar methodology validate proto-myth hypothesis?

**Research Question**:
How do historical linguists reconstruct proto-languages, and can these methods apply to mythology? Investigate: (1) What are rigorous methods for PIE reconstruction (comparative method, regular sound correspondences, exclusion of borrowings)?, (2) Have scholars attempted parallel "comparative mythology" using linguistic methods?, (3) Georges Dumézil's comparative Indo-European mythology—scholarly reception and critiques, (4) Difference between linguistic reconstruction (systematic rules) and mythological comparison (thematic parallels)—can mythology be reconstructed with same rigor?, (5) What would constitute evidence for common proto-myth vs. independent development from cognitive universals?, (6) How could framework's proto-myth claims be tested?

**Expected Impact**:
If rigorous methods exist for mythological reconstruction, framework could adopt them. If mythology resists linguistic-style reconstruction, proto-myth claims remain speculative interpretive framework.

## DOMAIN 11: CRITICAL SELF-EXAMINATION — FRAMEWORK VULNERABILITIES

### [CROSS] Confirmation Bias Safeguards: How Framework Self-Corrects

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CROSS-001, CONSC-001

**Context**:
Critical analysis throughout identifies confirmation bias risks: framework finds what it looks for (correspondences in texts, ruling love in history, gnostic impulse in opponents). Knowledge graph acknowledges CONSC-001 "unfalsifiable as currently formulated—any outcome can be retroactively explained." How can framework avoid bias trap?

**Research Question**:
What methods exist in theology, philosophy, and history of ideas to avoid confirmation bias in interpretive frameworks? Investigate: (1) Falsificationism in philosophy of science (Popper)—can it apply to hermeneutic frameworks?, (2) How do theologians distinguish legitimate typology from eisegesis (reading meaning into text)?, (3) Biblical scholars' methods for distinguishing authorial intent from interpreter's projection, (4) Social science methods for avoiding selective evidence (systematic sampling, blinding, preregistration)—any applicable to historical/theological research?, (5) Case studies where interpretive frameworks corrected themselves based on contradictory evidence, (6) What institutional practices (peer review, devil's advocacy, adversarial collaboration) could framework adopt?

**Expected Impact**:
Critical for framework's intellectual integrity. If safeguards exist and framework adopts them, demonstrates commitment to truth over confirmation. If none exist for hermeneutic frameworks, must acknowledge inherent limitation.

**Notes**:
Meta-methodological question. Addresses critical analysis concern that framework is confirmation-bias-prone by design.

### [CROSS] Parsimony Test: What Does Framework Explain That Simpler Theories Cannot?

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CROSS-001, CONSC-001, CROSS-002

**Context**:
Critical analysis repeatedly invokes Occam's Razor: simpler explanations should be preferred unless complex theory adds unique explanatory power. Framework adds metaphysical layer (correspondences, influx, ruling love, consciousness-as-causal) to naturalist explanations. What does this addition accomplish?

**Research Question**:
Conduct systematic parsimony analysis: For each major framework claim, identify simplest alternative explanation and articulate what framework's metaphysical addition provides. Examples: (1) NDE phenomenology: dying brain (simpler) vs. afterlife evidence (framework)—what does afterlife interpretation explain that dying brain cannot?, (2) Cultural evolution: dual inheritance theory (simpler) vs. CDE (framework)—unique predictions?, (3) Mythic parallels: cognitive universals + diffusion (simpler) vs. Ancient Word divergence (framework)—testable differences?, (4) Paul's theology: Jewish apocalypticism (simpler) vs. gnostic proprium (framework)—explanatory advantage?, (5) Gospel formation: natural bricolage (simpler) vs. divine influx (framework)—observable distinction? For each: Does framework make novel predictions, explain anomalies, or provide existential meaning (not explanatory power)?

**Expected Impact**:
Honest assessment of what framework provides. If it explains phenomena simpler theories cannot, justifies metaphysical addition. If it provides meaning but not explanation, should be framed as existential/theological framework, not superior epistemology.

**Notes**:
Core philosophical assessment. Addresses Occam's Razor challenges throughout critical analysis. Extended research question requiring systematic comparison.

### [CROSS] Framework Success Criteria: What Would Change Framework's Mind?

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: CROSS-001

**Context**:
Critical analysis questions whether framework can be challenged by evidence. If unfalsifiable claims dominate and all outcomes confirm ruling love polarity, framework becomes closed system. Intellectual integrity requires specifying conditions that would force revision.

**Research Question**:
What empirical findings or theoretical developments would require framework revision or abandonment? Systematically identify: (1) NDE research: What patterns would disconfirm post-mortem consciousness interpretation?, (2) DOPS research: What failure rate would undermine reincarnation evidence?, (3) Cross-cultural NDE studies: What distribution of being identification would challenge framework?, (4) Cultural evolution: What historical trajectories cannot be explained by ruling love polarity?, (5) Textual criticism: What source findings would challenge correspondence interpretations?, (6) Neurological: What findings would make consciousness-as-fundamental untenable?, (7) Philosophical: What demonstration would prove framework is unfalsifiable and therefore not genuine knowledge claim?

**Expected Impact**:
Demonstrates intellectual honesty and openness to revision. If framework can specify disconfirming conditions, shows it's empirically engaged. If cannot, confirms critical analysis: this is closed theological system, not open epistemology.

**Notes**:
Most important meta-question. See critical issues summary "Key Questions Framework Must Answer." This addresses all 15 questions systematically.

## DOMAIN 12: INTEGRATION & SYNTHESIS — CROSS-DOMAIN CONNECTION GAPS

### [CROSS] Correspondence Principle Applied Across Domains: Consistency Check

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-001, CROSS-002, MYTH-001, BIBL-003

**Context**:
Framework applies Swedenborgian correspondences to biblical texts, myths, and historical events. Cross-Domain nodes are underrepresented (5 nodes, 4%). Need systematic analysis: are correspondence interpretations consistent across domains, or does framework apply them selectively?

**Research Question**:
Conduct cross-domain correspondence consistency analysis: (1) Does "water" correspond to same spiritual reality in Genesis, Exodus, Gospels, and NDE reports?, (2) Do "mountain," "journey," "battle," "marriage" correspondences remain stable across textual domains?, (3) Where correspondences shift meaning, what's the principle governing variation?, (4) How does framework distinguish legitimate correspondence from allegorical reading that could fit any text?, (5) Are there domains where correspondence doctrine works better (myth, sacred texts) vs. worse (history, scientific findings)?, (6) Does framework apply correspondences to ALL events/texts or only those fitting theology?, (7) Statistical: What percentage of framework's textual analyses use correspondence interpretation vs. other methods?

**Expected Impact**:
If correspondences are systematically applied with internal consistency, strengthens doctrine. If applied selectively or inconsistently, confirms circular reasoning concern.

**Notes**:
Cross-Domain expansion (currently 4%). Addresses critical analysis falsifiability and consistency concerns.

### [CROSS] Divine Influx vs. Human Creativity: Observational Distinction

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Nodes**: SWED-002, CROSS-002, MYTH-001

**Context**:
Framework claims Gospel writers, myth-makers, and scribes were guided by divine influx operating through natural bricolage process. Critical issues summary Key Questions #7: "What's the difference between 'influx' and 'human creativity' observationally?" This is unfalsifiability problem—same outcome (coherent narrative) explained by influx or by human skill.

**Research Question**:
Can divine influx be distinguished from human creativity by any observable criteria? Investigate: (1) What does Swedenborg say about how influx operates—conscious, unconscious, deterministic, probabilistic?, (2) Would authors know they were receiving influx or would it feel like their own thoughts?, (3) Comparison: inspired Scripture vs. uninspired religious texts—what observable differences validate inspiration claims?, (4) Could brilliant natural creativity (Shakespeare, Homer) produce texts indistinguishable from influx-guided ones?, (5) Does framework predict any signatures of influx (internal coherence, prophetic accuracy, cross-generational consistency) testable against non-influx texts?, (6) If influx is indistinguishable from creativity, is this distinction meaningful or theological projection?

**Expected Impact**:
Central unfalsifiability problem. If no observational distinction exists, "influx" is theological interpretation imposed on natural creativity, not empirical claim. Framework must acknowledge this or provide testable criteria.

**Notes**:
Critical issues summary Key Question #7. Addresses whether theological layer adds explanatory power or just religious language to natural phenomena.

### [CROSS] Ruling Love Polarity: Mixed Motivations and Developmental Change

**Target**: `[GDR]`  
**Status**: Open  
**Date Added**: 2025-12-27  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Related Nodes**: CROSS-003, SWED-008

**Context**:
Critical analysis Section 3: ruling love polarity is reductive binary model (self-love vs. neighbor-love). Human motivation is multidimensional. Framework needs to address: (1) How does it handle mixed motivations?, (2) Can ruling love change over lifetime (regeneration), and if so, how is binary maintained?, (3) What about stages of moral development (Kohlberg)?

**Research Question**:
How does framework's ruling love binary relate to contemporary moral psychology? Investigate: (1) Kohlberg's stages of moral development (progression from self-interest to principled ethics)—compatible with ruling love or contradictory?, (2) Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory (multiple independent values)—can this be mapped to binary or does it refute reductive model?, (3) Developmental psychology: do people shift orientations over lifespan, and if so, what does this mean for "ruling love" as fixed pole?, (4) How does Swedenborg handle ambiguous cases—people with mixed motivations?, (5) Does regeneration (SWED-008) mean ruling love CAN change, and if yes, is binary about current state vs. ultimate trajectory?, (6) Can framework distinguish temporary self-interest (biological drives, survival) from proprium (spiritual self-glorification)?

**Expected Impact**:
Framework must show ruling love model handles real human complexity. If cannot, model is oversimplified theological construct useful for interpretation but not descriptive of psychology.

**Notes**:
Critical analysis Section 3 and critical issues #11. Moderate priority—framework can survive this challenge but needs nuancing.
