# **The Inverted Influx: The Profanation of Correspondence and the Deification of Self in Disney's *Wish***

## **I. Introduction: The Metaphysical Trajectory of the Disney Studio**

The historiography of the Walt Disney Studio has traditionally been framed through the lenses of technological innovation, commercial expansion, and artistic evolution. However, a deeper, more rigorous analysis reveals that the studio’s output during its "Golden Age" was underpinned by a sophisticated metaphysical architecture. As outlined in the foundational document *The Invisible Influx*, the studio operated upon an "Active Substrate" of Swedenborgian thought—a specific theological framework derived from the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772).1 This substrate provided the studio with a "physics of the soul," enabling animators to solve the "Crisis of Ensoulment" by adhering to the Doctrine of Influx, where "inner force drives outer form".3 For nearly a century, this correspondence between spiritual causes and natural effects allowed Disney films to serve as secular parables of regeneration, where the natural world acted as a theater representing the spiritual state of its inhabitants.

The release of the studio’s centennial film, *Wish* (2023), marks a critical and catastrophic rupture in this lineage. While the film explicitly positions itself as a tribute to the studio's legacy—serving as an origin story for the iconic "wishing star"—it functionally operates as a dismantling of the very spiritual logic that built that legacy.4 The user’s hypothesis suggests that *Wish* is not merely a deviation but the "culmination" of a shift toward the polarization of the self as the sole subject of celebration. It posits that while the film retains the *visual language* of correspondence—glowing orbs, responsive nature, anthropomorphic guides—it is "hollow inside," having severed the connection to the Divine Influx in favor of a closed loop of self-reference \[User Query\].

This report undertakes an exhaustive theological and semiotic audit of *Wish* to validate this hypothesis. By applying the rigorous definitions of Swedenborgian theology—specifically the concepts of **Proprium** (selfhood), **Profanation** (the mixing of holy and profane), and **Ruling Love**—we demonstrate that *Wish* represents a theological inversion. Where earlier films like *Pinocchio* (1940) and *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* (1948) depicted the "Divine Influx" descending from a transcendent source to vivify the humble recipient, *Wish* depicts the "Divine Spark" as inherent in the material self ("stardust"), requiring no external authority and answering to no moral law beyond "authenticity".6

This shift is not merely a change in narrative fashion; it is a structural dismantling of the "Secular New Jerusalem" that Walt Disney inadvertently constructed. In *Wish*, the "Kingdom of Uses"—where art serves to evoke charity and faith—has been conquered by the "Kingdom of Self," where the universe exists to validate the desires of the ego. The analysis reveals that while the *physics* of the Disney universe remain Swedenborgian, its *theology* has become Gnostic, celebrating the liberation of the divine self from the tyranny of the Creator-King. This report argues that this transition constitutes a "profanation" of the studio's core ethos, marking the age in which Disney has "served its purpose" and fallen into spiritual ruin.

## **II. The Theoretical Framework: Swedenborg’s Architecture of Being**

To understand the magnitude of the shift represented by *Wish*, one must first establish the theological baseline against which the film is being measured. The "Active Substrate" of the Disney Studio was built upon a specific understanding of how life moves into form—an understanding rooted in the Neoplatonic and Christian mysticism systematized by Emanuel Swedenborg.

### **2.1 The Doctrine of Influx: Vertical Causality**

Swedenborg’s cosmology is strictly hierarchical. It posits that reality is composed of discrete degrees: the Celestial (Love), the Spiritual (Wisdom), and the Natural (Action). Crucially, life is not inherent in the natural world; it flows *into* it from the spiritual world. This is the **Doctrine of Influx**.

* **Source:** All life originates from the Lord, who is the "Spiritual Sun".8  
* **Transmission:** This life flows down through the heavens (the spiritual world) and terminates in the natural world.  
* **Reception:** Natural forms (humans, animals, trees) are "receptacles." They do not generate life; they receive it.3

In the Golden Age of Disney animation, this doctrine was secularized as the principle of "Inner Force driving Outer Form".1 When an animator drew a character, the movement (the natural effect) had to be driven by an emotion or intent (the spiritual cause). The arrow of causality pointed down: Spirit moves Matter. This was not a stylistic choice but an ontological assertion that the material world is dead until animated by spiritual influx.

### **2.2 The Proprium: The Danger of the Self**

The central antagonist in Swedenborgian theology is not a devil with a pitchfork, but the **Proprium** (Latin for "one's own"). The proprium refers to the human sense of selfhood—the vivid sensation that we live, think, and act from ourselves.

* **The Illusion:** The proprium is an illusion granted by God so that humans can have agency and reciprocate love. We *feel* like life is ours, but in reality, it is God’s life flowing through us.9  
* **The Fall:** Evil arises when humans believe the illusion is the reality. When a person confirms that they are the source of their own life, wisdom, and power, the proprium becomes "nothing but evil".11 It becomes the "Love of Self" (Amor Sui), which seeks to dominate others and be worshipped as a god.13  
* **Male vs. Female Proprium:** Swedenborg distinguishes between the "male proprium" (intellectual pride, love of one’s own wisdom) and the "female proprium" (love of one’s own beauty/affection). Regeneration requires the submission of this selfhood to the Divine Truth.15

### **2.3 Profanation: The Mixing of Holy and Profane**

**Profanation** is the most dangerous spiritual state in Swedenborg’s system. It is not simple ignorance or sin; it is the act of acknowledging spiritual truth and then twisting it to serve the love of self.9

* **Mechanism:** A profaner takes "holy things" (truths, rituals, the Word) and "mixes them with clay" (self-interest). This creates a spiritual hybrid that cannot be separated after death, leading to a state of "total vastation" where the human quality perishes.13  
* **The Babylon Archetype:** Swedenborg identifies "Babylon" as the ultimate form of profanation—specifically the use of religion to acquire dominion. The profaner appears pious and uses the language of heaven, but the internal end is power.9 The user’s query explicitly invokes this concept, arguing that *Wish* "profaned everything inside to celebrate the self."

### **2.4 The Ruling Love**

Every being is defined by a **Ruling Love** (or Dominant Love). This is the gravitational center of the soul. All thoughts, actions, and memories organize themselves around this core desire. If the ruling love is removed, the person effectively ceases to exist or becomes a "spiritual zombie" until it is restored.8

This theological vocabulary—Influx, Proprium, Profanation, and Ruling Love—provides the forensic tools necessary to dismantle the structure of *Wish*.

## **III. The Mechanics of Rosas: A Structural Analysis of the Wish**

The film *Wish* is explicit in its metaphysics. It establishes a world governed by precise rules regarding the nature of the soul, the storage of memory, and the source of magic. By analyzing these mechanics, we can see how the studio has retained the *structure* of Swedenborgian correspondence while inverting its *orientation*.

### **3.1 The Wish Orb as the Externalized Ruling Love**

In the film, a "wish" is not merely a passing thought; it is a tangible, glowing blue orb extracted from the chest of the wisher. This visual effect is a direct application of the Swedenborgian concept that spiritual things have substantial form in the spiritual world.1

* **The Extraction:** When a citizen of Rosas turns 18, they voluntarily surrender this orb to King Magnifico.  
* **The Consequence:** The extraction results in immediate memory loss. The person forgets their "greatest desire" and becomes docile, content, but spiritually incomplete.20  
* **The Analysis:** The "Wish Orb" corresponds perfectly to Swedenborg’s **Ruling Love**. It is the core of the person’s identity. By extracting it, Magnifico is not just taking a "dream"; he is performing a spiritual lobotomy. He is separating the person from their "vital heat" or spiritual life.1  
* **The Inversion:** In the Golden Age films (e.g., *Pinocchio*), the "wish" was an internal prayer directed upward to the Divine (the Star/Blue Fairy). It was an act of *connecting* the internal will with a higher power. In *Wish*, the "wish" is an external commodity that can be traded, hoarded, and shattered. The spiritual reality has been reified into a magical object, shifting the focus from *becoming* (regeneration) to *having* (possession).

The film presents the "Wish Orb" as something that belongs to the self ("my wish"). In Swedenborgian theology, a "good wish" (inspiration) comes from the Lord and flows *through* the person. To claim ownership of it ("It's mine") is the first step of the Proprium. The film validates this claim of ownership, framing the tragedy not as the *loss of connection to the Divine*, but as the *loss of property*.4

### **3.2 King Magnifico: The Love of Dominion and the False God**

King Magnifico is the most explicitly theological villain in the Disney canon since Judge Frollo. He is not merely a tyrant; he is a usurper of the Divine role.

* **The Monopoly on Providence:** Magnifico claims the sole right to decide which wishes are granted and when. He tells his subjects, "I decide what everyone deserves".22 This mimics the role of Divine Providence, but with a crucial flaw: Providence looks to the eternal welfare of the soul, while Magnifico looks to the temporal stability of his regime.  
* **The Fear of the New:** Magnifico refuses to grant wishes that are "vague" or "inspiring" (like Sabino’s wish) because they are dangerous to the status quo.20 This represents the **Proprium’s fear of Influx**. The Proprium wants a closed system where it is the master; it fears the "newness" of Divine Influx because that influx disrupts the ego’s control.  
* **The Mirror and the Self:** Magnifico is constantly shown gazing into mirrors.24 In Swedenborgian symbolism, the mirror represents the self-reflection of the proprium. The Proprium loves its own image. Magnifico’s magic turns green (the color of sensory/corporeal love in some symbolic systems, or "venom") when he taps into the "forbidden magic," which is explicitly described as "corrupting".22  
* **The Profanation:** Magnifico fits Swedenborg’s definition of the **Profaner of the Fifth Kind**: "those who attribute to themselves what is Divine".9 He uses the "holy things" (the wishes/souls of the people) to build his own power. He literally consumes the wishes to fuel his dark magic, a graphic depiction of the "adulteration of good".20

### **3.3 The Star: Stardust and the Immanent Divine**

If Magnifico represents the False God (The Proprium claiming Divinity), then the character **Star** represents the film’s proposed "True God." However, this "God" is radically different from the transcendent "Blue Fairy" of *Pinocchio*.

* **The Nature of Star:** Star is a "little ball of boundless energy" that descends from the sky.26 It is mute, childlike, and chaotic. It does not issue commands or demand moral regeneration; it simply "activates" things.  
* **The Theology of Stardust:** The central theological revelation of the film is delivered by the animals animated by Star: "We are all made of stardust".6  
* **The Immanent Frame:** This is the crux of the shift. The film argues that the "magic" is not something you receive from above (Influx); it is something you *are* physically composed of. The lyrics of "I'm a Star" state: "When it comes to the universe, we're all shareholders / We are our own origin story".7  
* **The Anti-Influx:** This creates a closed loop. If "we are our own origin story," there is no Creator, no influx from a spiritual world, and no need for regeneration. There is only the "remembering" of one’s inherent divinity. This is the definition of **Naturalism** or **Pantheism**, which Swedenborg spent volumes refuting. Swedenborg argued that nature is "dead" and only appears alive because of the influx of the spiritual.1 *Wish* argues that nature is inherently alive because it is made of "star stuff."

## **IV. The Profanation of the Substrate: A Forensic Comparison**

To validate the user’s claim that *Wish* is "hollow" and "profanes" the earlier tradition, we must compare the semiotic structure of *Wish* with the Golden Age films that established the "Active Substrate."

### **4.1 Pinocchio vs. Wish: The Source of Life**

* **Pinocchio (1940):**  
  * **The Wish:** Geppetto wishes for the puppet to be a real boy. He prays *up* to the Star (Divine Truth).  
  * **The Agency:** The Blue Fairy descends. She grants "life" (movement) but not "humanity" (soul). She tells Pinocchio he must *earn* his soul by proving himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish".30  
  * **The Logic:** Salvation/Ensoulment is a process of **Regeneration**. It requires obedience to Conscience (Jiminy Cricket) and the rejection of the Proprium (Pleasure Island/donkey transformation). The source of life is Transcendent (The Fairy/God).  
* **Wish (2023):**  
  * **The Wish:** Asha wishes for the liberation of the wishes. She wishes *at* the Star.  
  * **The Agency:** Star descends. It grants *power* immediately. It tells the characters "You’re a star".7  
  * **The Logic:** Salvation is a process of **Self-Realization**. There is no moral test. There is no demand to be "brave or unselfish" in a regenerative sense; the demand is to be "authentic" and to "take back your power." The source of life is Immanent (Stardust/Self).

**The Inversion:** *Pinocchio* teaches that the Self is a construct of wood that must be vivified by Divine Grace through moral effort. *Wish* teaches that the Self is a star that has been repressed by an external authority. *Pinocchio* is about **Kenosis** (emptying of self); *Wish* is about **Pleroma** (filling of self).

### **4.2 The Lion King vs. Wish: The Nature of Kingship**

* **The Lion King (1994):**  
  * **The King (Mufasa):** Represents **Divine Order/Truth**. He obeys the "Circle of Life" (a cosmic law greater than himself). He tells Simba, "There is more to being King than getting your way."  
  * **The Land:** The health of the land corresponds to the moral state of the King (Swedenborg’s *Maximus Homo*). When the rightful King rules, it rains. When the usurper (Scar) rules, there is drought.2  
  * **The Conflict:** The struggle is to restore Divine Order.  
* **Wish (2023):**  
  * **The King (Magnifico):** Represents **Patriarchal Control/The Demiurge**. He claims to protect the people but actually feeds on them.  
  * **The Land (Rosas):** The land is an artificial construct, a "utopia" built on a lie. It does not reflect the moral state of the King in a correspondent way; it reflects his *power*.  
  * **The Conflict:** The struggle is to **overthrow the concept of Kingship**. The film ends not with a "Good King" replacing the "Bad King," but with Queen Amaya (a peer) and Asha (a Fairy Godmother) establishing a more democratic/egalitarian distribution of magic.34 The hierarchical correspondence (God \-\> King \-\> People) is dismantled in favor of a horizontal network (Stardust \<-\> People).

**The Profanation:** Swedenborgian political theology is monarchical (representing the sovereignty of the Lord). *Wish* essentially argues that the "King" archetype itself is the problem. By creating a villain who explicitly mimics God (granting wishes, demanding worship, claiming omnipotence) and then having the "stardust" people overthrow him, the film acts out a **Gnostic Myth**: the rebellion of the divine sparks against the evil Demiurge.24

## **V. The Lyricism of Self-Worship: Deconstructing "I'm a Star"**

The song "I'm a Star" acts as the doctrinal creed of the film. It is here that the shift from Swedenborgian correspondence to modern "Expressive Individualism" is most chemically pure.

### **5.1 "We Are Our Own Origin Story"**

This line is the smoking gun of the user’s argument.6

* **Theological Implication:** In Swedenborgian thought, the "origin story" of every human is the Lord. We are created vessels. To say "we are our own origin story" is, in Swedenborgian terms, the definition of **Hell**. The fundamental delusion of the infernal spirits is the belief that they are self-created and self-sustaining.8  
* **The Vacuum:** If we are our own origin, there is no Influx. There is no vertical dimension. There is only the horizontal expansion of the self. The film presents this as a liberation ("That gets me excitatory"), but structurally, it cuts the lifeline to the Spiritual Cause. It traps the characters in the Natural World, which, without the Spiritual, is dead.

### **5.2 "When it comes to the universe, we're all shareholders"**

This lyric commercializes the cosmos.7

* **Swedenborgian View:** We are not shareholders; we are **stewards** (or "husbandmen"). The universe belongs to the Lord. We manage it for the sake of "Uses" (service to the neighbor).  
* **Wish View:** The universe is a joint-stock company of egos. "Shareholder" implies ownership, rights, and dividends. It validates the **Proprium’s** desire to possess the world. It reinforces the entitlement of the self to demand its wish be granted.

### **5.3 The Elimination of the Mediator**

In *Johnny Appleseed* (1948), the protagonist relies on his Bible and his Angel. He is humble. He knows he is small. "The Lord is good to me." In *Wish*, Asha does not pray to the Star for help; she summons it. And when the Star arrives, it does not solve the problem; it empowers *her* to realize she had the power all along. The lyrics "You're a star\!" act as a liturgy of self-congratulation. The external mediator (Star) dissolves into the internal reality (Self). This collapses the "Discrete Degrees" (God/Man) into a single "Continuous Degree" (Energy/Stardust), effectively erasing the distinction between Creator and Creature—a classic definition of Pantheism and, in Swedenborg’s view, a form of spiritual insanity.37

## **VI. King Magnifico: The Tragedy of the God-King**

The character of King Magnifico serves as a complex focal point for this theological inversion. The user argues that the film *profanes* the spiritual structure. Magnifico is the primary vehicle for this because he is built on the chassis of a Swedenborgian archetype but fueled by the modern critique of power.

### **6.1 Magnifico as the "Male Proprium"**

Magnifico fits the profile of the **Male Proprium** perfectly. He loves his own intelligence. He built the kingdom. He studied the magic. He believes he knows best.

* **The Sorcerer:** In Swedenborg, "magic" is often associated with the abuse of correspondences—using spiritual knowledge for selfish ends. Magnifico is a sorcerer who hoards the "remains" (wishes) of the people to build his tower (Babel archetype).17  
* **The Mirror:** His obsession with mirrors reflects the Proprium’s inability to see anything but itself.

### **6.2 The Mimicry of God**

Critically, Magnifico mimics the attributes of the Biblical God 24:

* He requires sacrifice (the giving up of the wish).  
* He demands faith ("trust me").  
* He is "benevolent" but "mysterious" (granting wishes, or not, in his own time).  
* He lives in the "high place" (the tower).

By making this God-figure the villain, and revealing that his "protection" is actually "theft," the film engages in a **Gnostic critique of Theism**. It suggests that the entity playing the role of God is actually a jealous hoarder who wants to keep humanity ignorant (forgetful) and powerless.

* **The Profanation:** This is where the user’s argument of "profanation" hits hardest. The film takes the structure of Divine Providence (trusting God with your desires) and reframes it as **abuse**. It suggests that "trusting the King" is a form of slavery. Therefore, the only path to salvation is to reject the King and reclaim the wish for oneself.  
* **Swedenborgian Rebuttal:** A Swedenborgian analysis would argue that giving up the "proprial wish" (the selfish desire) to the Lord is exactly how one finds happiness. Magnifico is a *parody* of this. He takes the *good* wishes (inspiration) and crushes them. He is the **Devil posing as God**. But the film’s solution—"We are our own origin"—is to become **Little Gods** ourselves. It rejects the False God (Magnifico) but replaces him with the Self (Asha/Stardust), rather than the True God (The Lord). It trades a Tyrant for a Narcissist.

## **VII. The Hollow Core: Why Wish "Fails" the Substrate**

The user argues that *Wish* "looks like a framework of correspondence but is hollow inside." This hollowness can be located in the film’s failure to distinguish between **Vertical** and **Horizontal** power.

### **7.1 The Loss of "Uses"**

In the Golden Age (e.g., *Johnny Appleseed*), the goal of life was **Use**. Johnny didn't want apples for himself; he wanted to plant them for others. "The Lord is good to me... so I thank the Lord."

In *Wish*, the goal of life is the **Wish** itself. The wish is treated as an end, not a means. Sabino wants to "inspire," which is a use, but the film treats the *possession* of the wish as the primary good. The tragedy is that Sabino *forgot* the wish, not that he couldn't *perform* it.

This shifts the focus from **Action/Charity** (Swedenborgian Use) to **Identity/Desire** (Modern Expressive Individualism). The "orb" is a commodity of self-identity. To be without it is to be "hollow." But in Swedenborgian thought, we *should* be hollow of our proprium so the Lord can fill us. *Wish* argues we must fill ourselves with our own dreams.

### **7.2 The Democratization of Magic**

In *Cinderella* or *Sleeping Beauty*, magic was rare and providential. It came when needed, often as a reward for virtue (kindness, humility).

In *Wish*, magic is democratized. Asha gets a wand. The people have stardust. This reflects the modern democratic ethos, but it destroys the spiritual hierarchy of Correspondence. If *everyone* is a star, and *everyone* is a source of magic, then there is no Influx. There is just a flat plane of competing energies. The "Vertical Line" (God to Man) has been collapsed into a "Horizontal Web" (Man to Man).

This results in a narrative that feels "hollow" because there is no *mystery*. Everything is explicable as "physics" (stardust). The "Holy" has been removed, leaving only the "Magical."

### **7.3 The Failure of the Villain’s Redemption**

Disney villains used to be destroyed by their own evils (Scar eaten by hyenas, Frollo falling into fire). Magnifico is trapped in a mirror. This is poetic (he is trapped in his own self-reflection), but the film offers no counter-force of **Redemptive Love**.

In *Beauty and the Beast*, the Beast (a potential Magnifico) is saved by Belle’s love. In *Frozen*, Elsa is saved by Anna’s love. In *Wish*, Magnifico is simply overpowered by the collective will of the people chanting "I’m a Star." It is a victory of **Force**, not **Love**. It is a revolution, not a regeneration. This betrays the deepest core of the Swedenborgian substrate: that evil can only be conquered by Good, not by a stronger/better Self.

## **VIII. Conclusion: The Age of the Profane**

The investigation confirms the user’s thesis with high fidelity. *Wish* is the culmination of a trajectory that began with the "Active Seeking" of spiritual truth in the 1930s but has ended in the "Active Celebration" of the self in the 2020s.

**1\. The Persistence of Mechanics:** The film proves that the *mechanics* of the Swedenborgian substrate—the visualization of internal states (orbs), the correspondence of nature (talking animals), the personification of light (Star)—are structurally embedded in the studio’s DNA. They cannot make a film without them.

**2\. The Inversion of Orientation:** However, the *orientation* of these mechanics has been rotated 180 degrees.

* **Golden Age:** Influx is **Vertical** (God \-\> Man). The Hero is Humble. The Villain is the Ego.  
* **Wish:** Influx is **Internal/Immanent** (Stardust \-\> Man). The Hero is Self-Actualized. The Villain is the Authority Figure who blocks Self-Actualization.

**3\. The Definition of Profanation:** By Swedenborg’s definition, *Wish* is a profanation. It takes the "holy truths" of the substrate—that we are connected, that the inner world drives the outer, that love is the substance of life—and "mixes them" with the clay of the Proprium ("We are our own origin," "I'm a star"). It uses the language of Heaven to preach the gospel of the Self.

**4\. The "Ruin" of the Studio:** The user’s sentiment that the studio has "fell into ruin" finds support in this analysis. If the "Disney Magic" was originally a secularized form of "Divine Influx"—a way of reminding audiences of a transcendent reality—then *Wish* represents the moment the studio stopped pointing at the Moon and started worshiping the Finger. By collapsing the Divine into the Human, they have drained the "reservoir of mystery" that sustained them for a century. They have replaced the "Invisible Influx" with a "Visible Feedback Loop" of the ego staring into a mirror and singing its own praises.

The studio has indeed served its purpose. It built a cathedral of correspondence, but in *Wish*, it has removed the altar to the Lord and installed a mirror in its place.

## **Summary Table: The Inversion of Correspondence in *Wish***

| Element | Swedenborgian / Golden Age Meaning | Interpretation in Wish (2023) | Theological Implication (Profanation) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Star** | **Divine Truth/Providence.** A transcendent guide to be prayed *up* to (*Pinocchio*). | **Stardust/Self.** An immanent energy source that confirms "You are a star." | **Pantheism:** Replaces the Creator with the created matter. |
| **The Wish** | **Prayer/Intent.** A spiritual desire connecting the Will to the Divine. | **Ruling Love (Objectified).** A commodity of identity extracted and hoarded. | **Materialism:** Turns spiritual life into a tangible object of ownership. |
| **The King** | **Divine Order/Wisdom.** The conduit of Influx for the land (*The Lion King*). | **The Demiurge/Tyrant.** A false god who hoards power and must be overthrown. | **Gnosticism:** Authority is inherently evil; salvation comes from rebellion. |
| **The Origin** | **The Lord.** "In Him we live and move and have our being." | **The Self.** "We are our own origin story." | **Auto-soterism:** The Proprium claims self-creation (the primal sin). |
| **Magic** | **Influx.** The life force flowing from the spiritual to the natural. | **Technology/Biology.** "All life is made of stardust." | **Naturalism:** Reduces spiritual mystery to physical/biological fact. |
| **Salvation** | **Regeneration.** Submission of the Proprium to the Lord. | **Self-Actualization.** Reclaiming the Proprium from the King. | **Narcissism:** Salvation is the unrestricted expression of the self. |

*Wish* effectively closes the circle. The studio that began by animating the "Soul" as a gift from the Divine has ended by animating the "Ego" as the only divinity that matters. The "Active Substrate" remains, but it is now powering a machine designed to celebrate the very force—the Proprium—that Swedenborg warned was the source of all evil.
