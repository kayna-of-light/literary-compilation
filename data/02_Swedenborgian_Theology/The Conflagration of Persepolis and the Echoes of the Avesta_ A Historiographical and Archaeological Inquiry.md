# **The Conflagration of Persepolis and the Echoes of the Avesta: A Historiographical and Archaeological Inquiry**

## **1\. Introduction: The Intersection of Myth, Memory, and Materiality**

The destruction of Persepolis in the spring of 330 BCE by the forces of Alexander III of Macedon constitutes one of the most defining ruptures in the history of the ancient Near East. It was an event of singular violence that signaled the irrevocable collapse of the Achaemenid Empire, the first "world empire" that had spanned from the Indus to the Aegean. Yet, beyond the immediate geopolitical transfer of power from the House of Achaemenes to the Macedonian conqueror, the sack of Persepolis has engendered a profound and enduring historiographical controversy regarding the preservation of knowledge.  
Central to this controversy is the persistence of a Zoroastrian hagiographic tradition which asserts that Alexander—vilified in Middle Persian texts as *Guzastag*, or "The Accursed"—did not merely burn a palace, but deliberately destroyed the sacred scriptures of the Zoroastrian faith, the *Avesta*. According to these accounts, a complete written archetype of the holy texts, inscribed in gold upon twelve thousand prepared ox-hides, was housed in the royal archives of Persepolis and was consumed by the flames of the Macedonian conquest. This narrative posits Alexander not merely as a military adversary, but as a theological cataclysm, an agent of the Evil Spirit (*Angra Mainyu*) sent to obliterate the divine word of Ahura Mazda.  
However, this tradition stands in stark tension with the silence of contemporary Hellenistic historiography and the findings of modern philology. Greek and Roman historians, while detailing the looting of the treasury and the drunken revelry that allegedly precipitated the fire, make no mention of a sacred library. Furthermore, the prevailing consensus among Iranologists and philologists suggests that the *Avesta* was, during the Achaemenid period, a fundamentally oral corpus, transmitted through the mnemonic rigors of the Magian priesthood rather than through written codices.  
This report seeks to adjudicate this dispute through a rigorous synthesis of Classical historiography, Sasanian religious literature, and the archaeological data derived from the ruins of Persepolis itself. By triangulating the literary silence of the West, the lamentations of the East, and the physical evidence of clay and ash, we aim to construct a neutral historiographical assessment of what was truly lost in 330 BCE. The inquiry is guided by the need to distinguish between the legendary expansions of a traumatized community and the historical realities of ancient record-keeping.  
To understand the fate of the Achaemenid archives, one must navigate three distinct epistemological landscapes: the political narratives of the Greek conquerors, who sought to frame the destruction as either policy or accident; the theological narratives of the Zoroastrian priesthood, who sought to explain the fragmentation of their canon; and the material reality of the Persepolis Fortification Archive, which survived the fire precisely because of the nature of its medium.

## **2\. The Classical Historiography of the Sack: Vengeance, Policy, and Silence**

The primary contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of Alexander’s campaigns derive from Greek and Roman authors writing centuries after the events, yet basing their narratives on the lost journals of Alexander’s companions (Ptolemy, Aristobulus, Nearchus, and Callisthenes). These sources—Arrian, Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and Quintus Curtius Rufus—provide the foundational Western understanding of the events at Persepolis. Their accounts are rich in military and political detail but notably deficient in references to Iranian religious literature.

### **2.1 The Narrative of Retribution**

The dominant theme in the Classical sources regarding the destruction of Persepolis is retribution. The war against Persia was ideologically framed by the League of Corinth as a pan-Hellenic crusade to avenge the invasion of Greece by Xerxes I in 480 BCE, particularly the burning of the Acropolis and the destruction of the Temple of Athena.  
**Arrian’s Political Pragmatism:** Flavius Arrianus (Arrian), writing in the 2nd century CE but relying heavily on the eyewitness accounts of Ptolemy and Aristobulus, presents the destruction of the palace as a calculated act of statecraft. In his *Anabasis of Alexander*, Arrian reports that Alexander resolved to burn the royal palace contrary to the advice of Parmenion, who argued that it was unwise to destroy what was now Alexander's own property and that it would signal to the Asians that he intended merely to conquer and depart rather than to rule. Arrian states:  
"Alexander described it to the Macedonians as their worst enemy among the cities of Asia... but the great royal palace, famed throughout the inhabited world, had been condemned to the indignity of total destruction."  
For Arrian, the fire was a symbolic termination of the Achaemenid dynasty. It was a message of finality. Crucially, Arrian’s account is devoid of the romantic or chaotic elements found in other sources. There is no mention of a drunken party, no mention of Thaïs, and absolutely no mention of a library or religious archives. The silence of Arrian is significant because his sources were military men (Ptolemy later became King of Egypt) who would have been concerned with the inventory of the palace. They cataloged the vast treasures—thousands of talents of bullion—but noted no books.

### **2.2 The Narrative of Drunken Revelry: Thaïs and the Torches**

In contrast to Arrian’s sober assessment, the "Vulgate" tradition—represented by Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and Quintus Curtius Rufus—ascribes the conflagration to a spontaneous, alcohol-fueled impulse instigated by an Athenian courtesan.  
**Diodorus Siculus (1st Century BCE):** Diodorus describes a scene of debauchery following the seizure of the city’s immense wealth. He writes that Alexander held a victory banquet where Thaïs, an Athenian mistress of Ptolemy, declared that it would be Alexander's "greatest achievement in Asia" to join in the Bacchic procession and set fire to the palace, allowing "women's hands to destroy in an instant what had been the pride of the Persians". Diodorus explicitly links this to the destruction of Athens. The narrative describes a chaotic procession of drunken revelers, with Alexander throwing the first torch, followed by Thaïs. The fire, fed by the cedar beams of the palace, spread rapidly.  
**Plutarch (1st–2nd Century CE):** Plutarch’s *Life of Alexander* echoes Diodorus, adding the detail that Alexander arguably regretted the act almost immediately and ordered the fire extinguished, though it was too late. Plutarch emphasizes the immense loot taken from the city, noting that the treasury contained 2,500 tons of gold and silver, which required thousands of mules and camels to transport.  
**Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st Century CE):** Curtius Rufus provides the most vivid description of the physical destruction. He notes that the palace’s extensive use of cedar wood made it a tinderbox. He writes:  
"Large sections of the palace had been made of cedar, so they quickly took flame and spread the conflagration over a large area... Such was the end of the palace that had ruled all the East."

### **2.3 The Historiographical Anomaly: The Missing Library**

A critical analysis of these texts reveals a glaring omission relevant to the Zoroastrian claim. The Greeks were not unfamiliar with the concept of libraries or archives. They knew of the libraries of Egypt and Mesopotamia. If Alexander had encountered a massive repository of "12,000 ox-hides" written in gold ink—an object of immense material value and curiosity—it is highly probable that it would have been recorded, if only as an item of plunder.

* **Valuation of Plunder:** The Classical sources are meticulous in their accounting of the plunder: gold, silver, purple dyes, furniture, and textiles are all listed. The absence of "books" or "scrolls" in these inventories suggests that either they were not present in a form recognizable to the Greeks as a valuable library, or they were considered administrative detritus unworthy of specific mention.  
* **The "Barbarian" Religion:** While Herodotus had earlier described the customs of the Persians (noting they had no statues, temples, or altars), the Alexander historians show little interest in Persian theology or liturgy. Their focus is on the *political* entity of the Persian Empire. The destruction is framed as the end of a *regime*, not a *religion*.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Classical Sources on Persepolis**

| Source | Date | Motivation for Fire | Key Protagonist | Mention of Archives/Books | Mention of Magi |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Diodorus Siculus** | 1st c. BCE | Revenge for Athens (480 BCE) | Thaïs (Athenian) | None | None |
| **Quintus Curtius** | 1st c. CE | Drunken impulse / Revenge | Thaïs | None | None |
| **Plutarch** | 1st-2nd c. CE | Drunken impulse / Revenge | Thaïs | None | None |
| **Arrian** | 2nd c. CE | Political Policy (Calculated) | Alexander | None | None |

The consensus of the "Western" historiography is clear: The destruction was physical and political. There is no record in the Greco-Roman tradition of a deliberate campaign to erase Zoroastrian scriptures during the sack of Persepolis.

## **3\. The Zoroastrian Hagiographic Tradition: The Myth of the "Two Copies"**

When we cross the cultural divide to the Iranian sources, the narrative shifts dramatically. For the Zoroastrians, the burning of Persepolis was not merely the end of a dynasty but the catastrophic rupture of their spiritual heritage. The sources for this tradition are primarily Middle Persian (Pahlavi) texts composed or redacted in the Sasanian (224–651 CE) and early Islamic periods (9th–10th centuries CE). These texts, written by the priesthood, view history through a theological lens.

### **3.1 The Narrative of the *Denkard* and *Arda Viraf Namag***

The core of the Zoroastrian claim is preserved in the *Denkard* (Acts of the Religion) and the *Arda Viraf Namag* (Book of the Righteous Viraf). These texts present a coherent, albeit legendary, history of the transmission of the *Avesta*.  
**The *Denkard* Account:** The *Denkard*, an encyclopedic compendium of Zoroastrian knowledge, asserts that the Achaemenid King Darius (identified as *Dara son of Dara* in the conflated Kayanian/Achaemenid chronology) ordered the preservation of the entire religious corpus.  
"Darius son of Darius ordered the preservation of two written copies of the whole Avesta and its commentary (Zand) according as it was accepted by Zarathustra from Ahuramazda, one in the *Ganj-i Shapigan* (Royal Treasury) and the other in the *Diz-i Nipisht* (Fortress of Archives)."  
This passage is critical because it explicitly claims the existence of a *written* archetype (*nipišt*) during the Achaemenid era. The text continues to describe the fate of these copies:  
"The Ashkanian \[Arsacid/Parthian\] government got the Avesta and its commentary—which from its original pure and sound condition had been (owing to the devastation and harm inflicted by Alexander...) separated into parts and scattered about—to be copied out."  
**The *Arda Viraf Namag* Account:** This text, which frames a visionary journey to the afterlife, opens with a historical prologue explaining why the journey was necessary: the religion was in doubt because of the destruction wrought by Alexander.  
"The accursed Alexander the Roman... came to the land of Iran with great destruction... And this religious tradition (dēn), the entire Avesta and Zand as it was written on adorned ox-hides in golden ink, had been placed in Pābak’s city of Istaxr in the Fortress of Archives. That ill-omened adversary... carried them off and burnt them."  
Here, the text adds the specific detail of the medium: "adorned ox-hides in golden ink." This description evokes a document of immense value and durability, fitting for a royal archive.

### **3.2 The Demonization of Alexander (*Guzastag*)**

In these texts, Alexander is stripped of his "Greatness" and given the epithet *Guzastag* ("The Accursed"). He is portrayed not just as a conqueror but as an instrument of *Ahriman* (the Evil Spirit). The *Greater Bundahishn* elaborates that Alexander "extinguished an immense number of sacred fires" and "killed the rulers and priests (*mōbeds*), judges (*dasturs*), and wise men of Iran".  
This demonization serves a theological purpose. In Zoroastrian dualism, history is a battle between Order (*Asha*) and Chaos (*Drug*). The Achaemenid period is reimagined as a Golden Age of perfect religious observance, and Alexander represents the intrusion of Chaos that shattered this perfection.

### **3.3 The "Fortress of Archives" (*Diz-i Nipisht*)**

The location of the *Diz-i Nipisht* has been a subject of intense speculation. The *Arda Viraf Namag* places it in "Pābak’s city of Istaxr". Istakhr was a major city near Persepolis that served as the religious center of the Sasanian dynasty (the House of Sasan were guardians of the Anahita fire temple at Istakhr before they became kings).

* **Historical Geography:** Most scholars identify the "Fortress of Archives" either with a specific building on the Persepolis terrace (possibly the "Harem" or the "Treasury") or with the **Ka'ba-ye Zartosht**, a mysterious stone tower at the nearby necropolis of Naqsh-e Rustam.  
* **Sasanian Projection:** It is crucial to note that the term *Diz-i Nipisht* appears in Sasanian texts. It is likely that the Sasanians, looking at the impressive ruins of Persepolis and Naqsh-e Rustam, projected their own archival practices backward onto the Achaemenids. They assumed that a great empire *must* have had a great central library for its holy books.

### **3.4 The "12,000 Ox-Hides": Myth or Memory?**

The recurring detail of "12,000 ox-hides" is particularly contested.

* **The Skeptical View:** Scholars like Mary Boyce and Philip Kreyenbroek suggest this number is symbolic, representing a vast, complete corpus that contrasts with the fragmented texts of the Sasanian era. It emphasizes the magnitude of the loss.  
* **The Materialist View:** However, the mention of "ox-hides" (parchment/leather) is significant because it correctly identifies the medium used for Achaemenid royal records (Aramaic on leather), as opposed to the clay tablets used for regional administration or the oral transmission used for liturgy. This suggests the legend contains a "kernel of truth"—a memory of a large leather archive that *did* exist and *was* burned (discussed in Section 4).

**Table 2: The Two Copies Tradition**

| Copy Location | Fate According to Zoroastrian Tradition | Modern Scholarly Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ganj-i Shapigan (Royal Treasury)** | Seized by Greeks; scientific parts translated, rest destroyed/dispersed. | Likely contained Aramaic administrative records or tribute lists; possible source of "Pseudepigrapha." |
| **Diz-i Nipisht (Fortress of Archives)** | Burned by Alexander. | Refers to the destruction of the Persepolis archives; conflation of administrative and religious texts. |

## **4\. Archaeological Evidence: The Fire and the Fortification Archive**

To ground the literary debate in material reality, we must turn to the excavations of Persepolis. Conducted primarily by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago under Ernst Herzfeld (1931–1934) and later Erich Schmidt (1934–1939), these excavations provided definitive evidence regarding the nature of the fire and the archives.

### **4.1 The Discovery of the Persepolis Fortification Archive (PFA)**

In 1933, Herzfeld discovered a massive cache of clay tablets in the hollow fortifications at the northeast corner of the Persepolis terrace. This find, known as the **Persepolis Fortification Archive (PFA)**, contained tens of thousands of tablets dating from the 13th to the 28th year of Darius I (509–493 BCE). A second, smaller archive, the **Persepolis Treasury Archive (PTA)**, was found in the Treasury building.  
**The Irony of the Fire:** The preservation of these tablets is due to a supreme historical irony: **Alexander’s fire saved them.** The tablets were originally unbaked, sun-dried clay. Had the palace simply been abandoned, they would have turned to mud and disintegrated over centuries of rain and snow. However, the intense heat of the conflagration—fueled by the cedar beams and tapestries of the palace—baked the tablets into ceramic, hardening them and ensuring their survival for two and a half millennia.

### **4.2 The "Lost" Archive: Evidence of Parchment**

While the clay tablets survived, they provide undeniable evidence that they were merely one part of a larger bureaucratic system that included documents on perishable materials (leather or parchment).

1. **The Bullae Evidence:** Among the tablets, archaeologists found thousands of **bullae** (clay sealings). These are lumps of clay that were pressed over the knots of cords used to tie rolled documents. The reverse sides of these bullae often show the distinct impressions of leather or parchment grain and the texture of the cords.  
   * **Implication:** These bullae are the "ghosts" of the lost archive. They prove that thousands of parchment scrolls existed in the archives at the time of the fire. Unlike the clay, the parchment was incinerated instantly.  
2. **Textual References:** The Elamite texts themselves refer to scribes who wrote on skins. The term *kuš* (hide/skin) appears in the tablets, distinguishing these scribes from those who wrote on clay.  
3. **Ash Layers:** Excavations in the Treasury and Harem revealed thick layers of ash and debris. In some rooms, the ash was found to be the residue of burnt textiles, wood, and presumably, manuscripts.

### **4.3 Reconciling Archaeology with the "Ox-Hide" Legend**

The archaeological evidence creates a compelling convergence with the "12,000 ox-hides" legend.

* **Material Convergence:** The Zoroastrian tradition claims the texts were on "ox-hides." Archaeology confirms that the Achaemenid royal chancellery used animal skins for high-level records (Aramaic).  
* **Location Convergence:** The tradition places the texts in the "Fortress of Archives" and the "Treasury." Archaeology found the clay tablets (and the evidence of lost parchments) in the *Fortification* walls and the *Treasury* building.

**The Crucial Distinction:** However, the content of the surviving tablets is exclusively **administrative**. They record rations of wine, grain, and sheep; travel authorizations for satraps; and payments to workers. There is **no archaeological evidence** that these archives contained religious literature, hymns, or the *Avesta*. The "lost" parchment archive was almost certainly the Aramaic translation of these administrative records, or royal chronicles and diplomatic correspondence, rather than a theological library. The Sasanian priests likely conflated the memory of the *burnt royal archives* with the loss of their *religious tradition*.

## **5\. The Philological Debate: Orality vs. Literacy and the Existence of the Avesta**

Having established that an archive was burned, we must determine if the *Avesta* was inside it. This question divides Iranologists into two camps: the "Orality School," which dominates the consensus, and the "Historical School" associated with Mary Boyce.

### **5.1 The Consensus: The Paradigm of Orality**

The majority of scholars (including Jean Kellens, Prods Oktor Skjærvø, and Karl Hoffmann) argue that the *Avesta* was strictly an oral corpus during the Achaemenid period and was not committed to writing until the Sasanian era (4th–6th centuries CE).  
**Arguments for Orality:**

1. **Absence of Script:** The Achaemenids used Cuneiform (for monumental inscriptions) and the Aramaic alphabet (for administration). Neither script is capable of capturing the rich phonetic complexity of the Avestan language (e.g., its diverse range of vowels and sibilants). The "Avestan script" found in surviving manuscripts was invented in the Sasanian period specifically for the purpose of recording the oral liturgy.  
2. **Religious Orthopraxy:** In the Indo-Iranian religious tradition (shared with Vedic India), the *manthra* (holy word) is efficacious only when spoken aloud with precise intonation. Writing was often viewed as a pollution or a constraint on the divine word. The priest (*zaotar*) was a "living book".  
3. **Mnemonic Structure:** The Avestan texts, particularly the *Gathas* and *Yashts*, display the structural hallmarks of oral composition: metrical patterns, formulaic repetitions, and ring composition, all designed to aid memorization.

**Conclusion of the Consensus:** Alexander could not have burned the *Avesta* because it did not exist as a physical object. The "12,000 ox-hides" are a myth projected backward by a literate Sasanian society that could not conceive of a purely oral empire.

### **5.2 The Minority View: Mary Boyce and the "Living Books"**

Mary Boyce, a titan of Zoroastrian studies, offered a nuanced defense of the tradition. While acknowledging the primacy of oral transmission, she argued that the "burning" narrative was a metaphor for a very real destruction.  
**The Slaughter of the Magi:** Boyce argued that the "books" Alexander destroyed were the **Magi** themselves. The Avesta was distributed across the collective memory of the priesthood. Different priestly lineages were responsible for memorizing different *Nasks* (books) of the canon.  
"The hostility of the evil-destined... Alexander... killed several high priests and judges and priests and the masters of the Magians and upholders of the religion."  
When Alexander’s forces sacked the cities and temples, they massacred the priests who guarded these oral texts. If all the priests who knew a specific Nask were killed, that "book" was effectively "burned" and lost forever. Thus, the destruction was real, but the medium was flesh, not parchment.  
**The Possibility of a Written Aid:** Boyce also conceded that a *written reference copy* might have existed. She noted the Sasanian reference to "ox-hides" and "gold ink" aligns with Achaemenid royal display. It is plausible that a prestige copy of the texts existed in the Royal Treasury, written in Aramaic script (however imperfectly), as a symbol of royal piety. If such a singular object existed, its burning would have been a potent symbol of the religion's degradation.

### **5.3 The Hermippus Problem: "2 Million Verses"**

A frequent counter-argument against the "Orality" theory cites Pliny the Elder (1st Century CE), who mentions Hermippus of Smyrna (3rd Century BCE). Pliny writes:  
"Hermippus, a most studious writer about every aspect of magic, and an exponent of two million verses composed by Zoroaster, added summaries to his rolls...".  
Does this prove a massive written Zoroastrian canon existed in the Hellenistic period?

* **Analysis:** Most scholars identify these "two million verses" not as the liturgical *Avesta*, but as **Zoroastrian Pseudepigrapha**. In the Hellenistic world, "Zoroaster" became a magnet for works on magic, astrology, botany, and alchemy. Greek authors wrote treatises on these subjects and attributed them to the Persian sage to give them ancient authority.  
* **Conclusion:** The existence of these Greek texts in the Library of Alexandria proves that the *name* of Zoroaster was associated with books, but it does not prove the existence of the genuine Avestan canon in written form. In fact, the bizarre content of these pseudepigrapha (often contradicting Zoroastrian dualism) suggests they were forgeries.

## **6\. Alternative Explanations: How Was the Text Actually Lost?**

If Alexander did not burn a comprehensive library of Avestan texts, how do we explain the fragmentary state of the surviving corpus (which is estimated to be only a quarter of the original Sasanian canon)?

### **6.1 The Disruption of State Patronage**

The most immediate effect of Alexander’s conquest was the decapitation of the state support system. The Zoroastrian priesthood relied on royal patronage for their livelihood and for the maintenance of the fire temples. The Achaemenid kings provided vast resources for sacrifices and rituals.

* **Impact:** When the Macedonians took over, this funding dried up. The Magi were forced to retreat to the provinces (like Atropatene). Without the leisure and resources to train new generations of priests in the rigorous memorization of the *entire* canon, the more obscure or "scientific" portions of the oral tradition (law, medicine, geography) were gradually forgotten, leaving only the essential liturgy (*Yasna*).

### **6.2 The Neglect of the Parthians**

The Parthian (Arsacid) era (247 BCE – 224 CE) is often viewed by Sasanian sources as a period of religious decay. While the Parthians were Zoroastrians, they were also highly Hellenized. The *Denkard* claims that an Arsacid king (likely Vologases/Valakhsh) attempted to collect the scattered fragments of the oral tradition, suggesting that by the 1st century CE, the canon was already in disarray.

### **6.3 The Islamic Conquest and the "Real" Destruction**

It is essential to recognize that the surviving Avestan manuscripts are all derived from a single "base manuscript" dating to the 9th or 10th century CE—well *after* the Islamic conquest.

* **The Second Loss:** The Sasanians *did* write down the Avesta in the 4th–6th centuries. This written Sasanian Avesta was massive (21 Nasks). The vast majority of *this* written canon was destroyed or lost during the Islamic conquest of Persia (7th century) and the subsequent centuries of marginalization. The library of the Sasanians was indeed dispersed, and the texts that survive today are merely the liturgical manuals that were in constant daily use by the priests who fled to India (the Parsis).

**Historiographical Insight:** The Zoroastrian tradition likely *telescoped* these two traumas. The destruction wrought by the Arabs in the 7th century CE (who destroyed the Sasanian state and its written archives) was projected backward onto Alexander, the first "Alien Conqueror," creating a unified narrative of persecution.

## **7\. Dating the Avesta: What Existed in 330 BCE?**

To understand the magnitude of the loss, we must delineate the stratification of the Avestan texts. What parts of the canon definitely existed (in oral form) when Alexander stood before Persepolis?

### **7.1 The Old Avesta (c. 1500–1000 BCE)**

These are the most archaic texts, composed in a dialect close to Rigvedic Sanskrit. They were undoubtedly fixed and memorized centuries before Alexander.

* **The Gathas:** The 17 hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself.  
* **Yasna Haptanghaiti:** The "Liturgy of the Seven Chapters."  
* **Status in 330 BCE:** These were the core of the liturgy. It is virtually certain that the Magi at Persepolis recited these texts exactly as they are preserved today.

### **7.2 The Young Avesta (c. 900–400 BCE)**

These texts show a later stage of the language and often contain grammatical errors suggesting they were composed when Avestan was no longer a living mother tongue.

* **The Yashts:** Hymns to deities (Mithra, Anahita, Tishtrya). These contain pre-Zoroastrian mythological elements re-integrated into the faith.  
* **The Videvdad:** The "Law Against Demons," a code of purity and ritual law.  
* **Status in 330 BCE:** These texts were likely fully formed or "crystallized" by the Achaemenid period. The *Yashts* in particular reflect the imperial theology of the Achaemenids (e.g., the elevation of Mithra and Anahita under Artaxerxes II).

**Conclusion on Dating:** The "Great Avesta" (the 21 Nasks) likely existed as a stable oral corpus in 330 BCE. Alexander’s conquest did not destroy the *Gathas* or the core *Yashts* (which survive), but it likely led to the loss of the "encyclopedic" commentaries and legal texts that were not reinforced by daily ritual use.

## **8\. Historiographical Synthesis: The Function of the Myth**

Why did the Sasanians construct the specific narrative of the "Burned Book"? Albert de Jong argues that this was a necessary component of the "Sasanian Restoration" ideology.

1. **Legitimacy:** The Sasanians needed to present themselves as the restorers of a broken heritage to legitimize their overthrow of the Parthians. By claiming Alexander destroyed the text, they explained why the Parthians didn't have it, and why the Sasanians had to "re-assemble" it.  
2. **Competition with "Peoples of the Book":** In the 3rd and 4th centuries, Zoroastrianism faced competition from Christianity and Manichaeism—religions centered on written scriptures. To compete, the Zoroastrian priesthood needed a "Book." By claiming that the *Avesta* was *originally* a book (on ox-hides) that was lost, they could justify writing it down in the 4th century without appearing to innovate (which was considered heretical).

## **9\. Conclusion**

The burning of Persepolis in 330 BCE was a historical fact, confirmed by the charred ruins and the accidental firing of the clay tablets in the Fortification Archive. However, the specific claim that Alexander the Great destroyed the *Avesta* is a complex amalgam of history, memory, and myth.  
**Key Findings:**

1. **No Written Avesta:** The scholarly consensus maintains that the *Avesta* was an oral corpus in the Achaemenid period. Therefore, Alexander did not burn a "Zoroastrian Bible" because no such physical object existed.  
2. **Destruction of Archives:** Alexander *did* burn the royal administrative archives of Persepolis. Archaeological evidence (bullae) confirms that thousands of parchment or leather documents were incinerated. The Zoroastrian legend of the "12,000 ox-hides" likely preserves a historical memory of this administrative loss, conflated over time with religious loss.  
3. **The Slaughter of the Living Books:** As Mary Boyce argues, the "burning" of the Avesta is a metaphor for the slaughter of the Magi. The disruption of the oral transmission chain caused by the conquest was the true mechanism of the text's fragmentation.  
4. **Historiographical Construction:** The narrative of the "Burned Book" was crystallized by the Sasanian priesthood to explain the gaps in their tradition and to legitimize the creation of a written canon in the face of rival scriptural religions.

In the final analysis, Alexander the Great was indeed the destroyer of the Achaemenid textual heritage—not by burning a single library of gold-inked skins, but by shattering the imperial and priestly infrastructure that sustained the oral memory of Iran.
