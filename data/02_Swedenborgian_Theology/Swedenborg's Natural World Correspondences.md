# **The Universal Mirror: An Exhaustive Cartography of Natural Correspondences in the Theology of Emanuel Swedenborg**

## **1\. Introduction: The Physics of Spiritual Causality**

The natural world, in its vast and intricate complexity, is not merely a stage upon which human history unfolds, nor is it a random aggregation of matter governed by blind mechanical forces. In the theological physics of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), the physical universe is a "theatre representative" of the Lord’s kingdom. It is a mirror—a "speculum"—reflecting the infinite nuances of Divine Love and Wisdom through the finite forms of matter. This worldview is predicated on the "Doctrine of Correspondences," a hermeneutic and metaphysical framework asserting that every physical object, elemental force, and biological organism is an "ultimate" effect caused and sustained by a specific spiritual reality.  
To understand the Swedenborgian map of the cosmos is to understand a universe of "influx." The spiritual world, which is the realm of causes, flows continuously into the natural world, which is the realm of effects. Without this sustaining influx, the natural world would cease to exist, just as speech would cease without the thought that generates it. Consequently, the study of nature is, in its essence, the study of the spiritual topography of the human mind and the Divine nature. Every ecosystem, from the arid silence of the desert to the teeming biodiversity of the ocean, corresponds to a specific state of affection (love) and understanding (truth).  
This report presents a comprehensive cartography of these correspondences. Relying exclusively on Swedenborg’s theological writings—principally *Arcana Coelestia*, *Apocalypse Explained*, *Heaven and Hell*, and *The Spiritual Diary*—we map the external physical world. We exclude the correspondence of the human anatomy to focus entirely on the macrocosm: the elemental substrate, the mineral foundations, the hydrological cycles, the botanical landscape, and the zoological kingdom. This analysis reveals a dynamic, living symbolism where "Gold" is not merely a metal but the heavy, malleable substance of Celestial Love; where a "Lion" is not merely a predator but the roaring power of Divine Truth; and where the "Sun" is the primary icon of the Lord Himself.

### **1.1 The Principle of Discrete Degrees and Influx**

The architecture of this correspondence is hierarchical. Swedenborg distinguishes between the "Natural," "Spiritual," and "Celestial" degrees of reality. These are not continuous degrees—like the shading of light into dark—but "discrete" degrees, like the relationship between an end, a cause, and an effect.

* **The Celestial Degree:** Corresponds to the highest heaven, the "Will" faculty, and the motive of Love.  
* **The Spiritual Degree:** Corresponds to the middle heaven, the "Understanding" faculty, and the motive of Wisdom or Truth.  
* **The Natural Degree:** Corresponds to the physical world (and the lowest heaven), the realm of Action and Effect.

Everything in nature exists as a vessel for these higher degrees. A tree, for instance, has a natural form, but its growth corresponds to the spiritual progression of the intellect, and its fruit corresponds to the celestial good of practical use.

### **1.2 The Duality of Meaning: Genuine and Opposite**

A critical feature of Swedenborgian cartography is the "Principle of Opposites." Because humanity possesses free will and has, historically, turned away from the Divine flow (the "Fall"), the natural world acts as a vocabulary that can describe both heaven and hell. Every correspondence has a **Genuine Sense** (relating to the Lord, heaven, and regeneration) and an **Opposite Sense** (relating to the selfhood or "proprium," hell, and degeneration).

* **The Sun:** In the genuine sense, it is Divine Love. In the opposite sense, it is the burning fire of self-love.  
* **The Lion:** In the genuine sense, it is the power of Truth (The Lion of Judah). In the opposite sense, it is the ferocity of falsity destroying the church.

This report will systematically explore both poles of these correspondences, providing a complete map of the spiritual moral landscape overlaid upon the physical world.

## **2\. The Primal Forces: Heat, Light, and Atmospheres**

The genesis of all correspondence lies in the physics of light and heat. In Swedenborg’s system, these are not secondary byproducts of chemical combustion but the primary "substances" of the universe, emanating directly from the interaction between the Spiritual Sun and the Natural Sun.

### **2.1 The Two Suns and the Origin of Energy**

The cosmos is binary. There is a sun of the spiritual world and a sun of the natural world. This distinction is the pivot upon which all life turns.

* **The Spiritual Sun:** This is the first emanation of the Divine. It is not God Himself in His essence (which is infinite and unapproachable), but the sphere of His encompassing presence. To the angels, the Lord appears as this Sun.  
  * **Correspondence:** The Lord.  
  * **Heat:** Corresponds to **Divine Love**. Just as physical heat warms, expands, and sustains biological life, Divine Love warms the human will, expands the affections, and constitutes the vital "heat" of life.  
  * **Light:** Corresponds to **Divine Wisdom**. Just as physical light illuminates the eye and enables navigation, Divine Wisdom illuminates the understanding and enables spiritual perception.  
* **The Natural Sun:** This is pure fire and is described by Swedenborg as "dead." However, it was created to be a "recipient vessel" for the Spiritual Sun. Its function is to clothe spiritual forces in material substances so they can exist in time and space.  
  * **Genuine Sense:** The service of the natural to the spiritual; the auxiliary forces of nature supporting the growth of the mind.  
  * **Opposite Sense:** **Self-Love.** When worship is directed to nature or the natural sun, it corresponds to the worship of self. The "scorching heat" of the sun in the book of Revelation corresponds to the torments of lust and the hatred of truth.

### **2.2 The Atmospheres: The Medium of Transmission**

Energy requires a medium. Swedenborg details a physics of "atmospheres" that descend from the Spiritual Sun down to the earth. These distinct layers of gaseous or ethereal substances correspond to the levels of the human mind and the heavens.

| Atmosphere | Spiritual Correspondence | Associated Heaven | Faculty of Mind |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Aura** | Divine Love, Inmost Peace | Celestial (Third) | The Will (Inmost Affection) |
| **Ether** | Divine Wisdom, Spiritual Truth | Spiritual (Second) | The Understanding (Intellect) |
| **Air** | Thought, Perception, Action | Natural (First) | The Natural Mind/Sensory |

* **Aura:** The highest, most subtle atmosphere. It is the immediate vessel of Divine Love and corresponds to the celestial sphere of the mind—the unconscious or super-conscious level where love is felt as a state of peace and innocence.  
* **Ether:** The middle atmosphere, associated with the transmission of light (optics). It corresponds to the rational or spiritual mind, where truths are seen and understood. The "light of the mind" is not a metaphor but a reception of spiritual ether.  
* **Air:** The lowest atmosphere, associated with sound (acoustics) and respiration.  
  * **Sound:** Corresponds to the affection of thought. Speech is thought taking form in air.  
  * **Respiration (Breath):** Corresponds to the life of the **Understanding** (Truth/Faith). Just as the lungs purify the blood, the understanding purifies the will (heart) by teaching truth. Swedenborg asserts that in the "Most Ancient Church," humanity possessed "internal respiration," breathing with the spirit (Aura). The "Fall" necessitated the shift to external respiration (Air), signifying a separation of the will from the understanding to prevent total spiritual death.

### **2.3 Atmospheric Phenomena and Weather**

The variation of the atmosphere corresponds to the fluctuating states of the human spirit. The "weather of the soul" is a literal correspondence to the weather of the earth.

* **Wind:** Corresponds to the **influx of spiritual influence**.  
  * *Mechanism:* Just as wind is air in motion, spiritual influx is thought in activity.  
  * *The Four Winds:* Signify the influx of the heavens from all quarters (Good and Truth).  
  * *Storms/Tempests:* Correspond to **Temptation**. A storm is a disturbance in the atmosphere; temptation is a disturbance in the mind caused by the influx of falsities attacking truths. To "hold back the winds" (Rev 7:1) is to moderate the influx of truth so that those in a weak state are not destroyed by judgment before they are ready.  
* **Mist:** Corresponds to the **falsities of evil** or the obscurity of the natural mind. Mist rises from the ground (the sensory self) and obscures the sun (the Lord). It signifies the "fallacies of the senses"—beliefs based solely on physical appearance that cloud spiritual reality.  
* **Clouds:** Correspond to the **Literal Sense of the Word**.  
  * *Mechanism:* Clouds temper the heat and light of the sun, making it endurable. Similarly, the literal stories of the Bible (the cloud) veil the intense brilliance of the internal spiritual sense (the sun) so that man is not blinded or overwhelmed. The "Son of Man coming in the clouds" signifies the revelation of the internal sense through the literal text\].  
* **Rainbows:** While implied through the interaction of light and water, rainbows correspond to the **regeneration of the spiritual man**. They represent the modification of Divine Truth (light) through the truths of the literal sense (water), creating a beautiful covenant of conjunction.

## **3\. The Lithosphere: The Mineral Foundations**

Descending from the active atmospheres, we reach the passive, fixed matter of the earth. The mineral kingdom corresponds to the "Ultimate" or "Natural" degree—the hard, enduring facts and loves that form the foundation of existence.

### **3.1 Geology and the Structure of Truth**

The earth itself corresponds to the **Church** or the **External Man**. It is the container for the biological life (spiritual growth) that takes root within it.

* **Rock:** Corresponds to **The Lord as to Divine Truth** (specifically the truth of faith).  
  * *The Rock of Ages:* Represents the unshakeable nature of Divine Truth.  
  * *Clefts in the Rock:* Correspond to the obscure truths of faith where one may hide during temptation.  
  * *Opposite Sense:* The "hard heart" or the stubbornness of falsity that cannot be penetrated by good. In the spiritual world, those in "faith alone" without charity often dwell on rocky, barren plateaus.  
* **Stone:** Corresponds to **Natural Truth** or "Scientifics" (facts).  
  * *Mechanism:* Stones are used to build. Facts are the stones with which the mind builds its system of doctrines.  
  * *Hewn Stone vs. Unhewn Stone:* Unhewn stones (altars) represent truths from the Divine that are not altered by self-intelligence. Hewn stones represent doctrines fashioned by human reasoning (falsity).  
* **Dust:** Corresponds to the **lowest natural**, the corporeal, and the damned.  
  * *Meaning:* Dust is earth that has no cohesion and no life. It corresponds to the state of the "damned" or the "proprium" (selfhood) which is dry and disconnected from heaven. "To shake the dust off one’s feet" corresponds to rejecting the vile evils associated with a specific state or place.  
* **Sand:** Corresponds to **Scientifics (knowledge) without life**.  
  * *Meaning:* Sand is stone broken into tiny, incoherent particles. It corresponds to knowledge stored in the memory that is not organized into a life of use. The "sand of the sea" signifies the vast, innumerable quantity of natural facts that form the boundary of the intellect but are not spiritual in themselves. A house built on sand is a life built on memory-knowledge without the cohesion of love.  
* **Salt:** Corresponds to the **desire for conjunction** between Truth and Good.  
  * *Mechanism:* Salt gives flavor and preserves. Spiritually, truth without love is insipid and decays. The desire to unite truth with love is the "salt" of the earth. "Salt losing its savor" is truth that has lost its affection for good.

### **3.2 The Deep History of Metals: The Four Ages**

Swedenborg explicitly links the hierarchy of metals to the spiritual history of humanity, referenced as the Four Ages (Golden, Silver, Copper, Iron) and depicted in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (Daniel 2). This is not merely archaeological but ontological—it describes the descending quality of the human mind.

#### **3.2.1 Gold (The Celestial Degree)**

* **Core Correspondence:** **Celestial Good**; the Good of Love to the Lord.  
* **Properties:** Gold is the most heavy, precious, and ductile of metals. Its weight corresponds to the "gravitas" or importance of love. Its color corresponds to fire (love).  
* **Context:** The "Golden Age" (Most Ancient Church) was a state of innocence where humans were led directly by love. The Ark of the Covenant was overlaid with gold to signify that the inmost of the church is Love.  
* **Opposite Sense:** **The Evil of Self-Love**. Babylon is described as having a "golden cup," symbolizing the profanation of the highest good for the lowest end (dominion). The love of self is the "gold" of hell—highly valued by the ego but spiritually corrupt.

#### **3.2.2 Silver (The Spiritual Degree)**

* **Core Correspondence:** **Spiritual Truth**; the Truth derived from Good.  
* **Properties:** Silver is white and reflective, corresponding to the nature of truth which reflects the light of Divine Wisdom.  
* **Context:** The "Silver Age" (Ancient Church) was a state where direct perception of love was lost, and humanity began to be led by conscience and the precepts of faith (Truth).  
* **Opposite Sense:** **Falsity** that appears like truth. Spiritual counterfeiting.

#### **3.2.3 Copper/Brass (The Natural-Celestial Degree)**

* **Core Correspondence:** **Natural Good**; the Good of Charity and external kindness.  
* **Properties:** A base metal, reddish in color (linking it to fire/love), used for tools and vessels. It corresponds to the "neighborly love" of the natural man—kindness, morality, and good works that are external but genuine.  
* **Context:** The "Copper Age" corresponds to a state of natural goodness and simple obedience.

#### **3.2.4 Iron (The Natural-Spiritual Degree)**

* **Core Correspondence:** **Natural Truth**; Truth in its ultimate form; Scientific or Literal Truth.  
* **Properties:** Hard, rigid, brittle, used for weapons and strong structures. It corresponds to the strict adherence to rules, laws, and facts without the softening influence of high charity.  
* **Context:** The "Iron Age" is the lowest state of the church, where spiritual perception is lost, and only the hard, literal truth remains. The "legs of iron" in Daniel represent a church that stands on mere doctrine and authority.  
* **Opposite Sense:** **Hard Falsity**. The "rod of iron" with which the nations are ruled can signify the power of literal truth, but in the opposite sense, it is the harsh, crushing power of falsity used to dominate others.

### **3.3 Topography: The Moral Elevation**

In Swedenborg’s physics, "altitude" corresponds to "degree of state." High places correspond to internal/spiritual states; low places to external/natural states.

* **Mountains:** Correspond to **Celestial Love** (Love to the Lord).  
  * *Mechanism:* Mountains are elevated above the earth and are the first to catch the light of the sun. They correspond to the "highest" state of the mind which is nearest to the Lord.  
  * *The Seven Mountains (Rev 17):* In the opposite sense, these signify the **Profanation of Love**. When the love of self (Babylon) exalts itself to the height of heaven, it becomes a profane mountain.  
* **Hills:** Correspond to **Spiritual Love** (Charity toward the neighbor). They are lower than mountains, corresponding to the "lesser" but still elevated good of charity.  
* **Valleys:** Correspond to the **Natural Mind** or the "External Man."  
  * *Mechanism:* Valleys receive the runoff from the mountains. The natural mind is the vessel that receives the influx of good and truth from the internal spiritual mind. A "fruitful valley" is a natural mind rich in good works. A "dark valley" is a natural mind devoid of spiritual light.  
* **Caves/Caverns:** Correspond to **Obscurity** and the **Sensual Mind**.  
  * *Context:* In the spiritual world, the entrances to the hells often appear as dark caves or clefts in the rock. This corresponds to the desire of evil spirits (and the sensual mind) to hide from the Divine Light and dwell in the darkness of their own falsities. To "hide in the caves" (Rev 6\) corresponds to the terror of the evil when the light of truth reveals their internal state.

## **4\. The Hydrosphere: The Fluidity of Truth**

If the earth is the will/good, then water is the understanding/truth. Water cleanses, quenches thirst, and acts as a medium for transport—exact analogies for the functions of truth in the human spirit.

### **4.1 Bodies of Water and Intelligence**

* **The Ocean/Sea:** Corresponds to the **General Collection of Scientifics** (External Truths) and the **Literal Sense of the Word**.  
  * *Mechanism:* The sea is the gathering place of all waters. It corresponds to the memory, which is the gathering place of all knowledge. It is the boundary of the land (church).  
  * *Opposite Sense:* **Hell.** The sea can represent a chaotic abyss of falsities and lusts. The "beast rising out of the sea" (Rev 13\) represents false reasonings arising from the scientific memory to attack spiritual truth.  
* **Rivers:** Correspond to **Intelligence** and the **Flow of Wisdom**.  
  * *Mechanism:* A river flowing through a land corresponds to the influx of truth organizing and enlivening the mind.  
  * *River Euphrates:* Corresponds to the **Rational Mind**. It is the boundary of the land of Canaan (the spiritual church). When it flows gently, it is the reasoning of truth. When it floods, it signifies **False Reasoning** and the destruction of the church by sophistry.  
* **Fountains/Springs:** Correspond to the **Word** and the **Lord** as the Source of Truth.  
  * *Meaning:* A spring is the origin of the river. It represents the Lord as the source of all "Living Water" (Internal Truth).  
* **Wells:** Correspond to the **Literal Sense of the Word**.  
  * *Mechanism:* Water in a well is deep and must be drawn up with effort. This corresponds to the study required to extract doctrine from the literal text of the Bible.  
* **Pools:** Correspond to **Intelligence** derived from knowledges.  
  * *Context:* A "pool" is collected water (knowledge) available for use. The "Pool of Siloam" represents the truths of the Word that heal mental blindness.  
* **Marshes/Miry Places:** Correspond to **Profanation** and **Falsities**.  
  * *Mechanism:* Stagnant water breeds disease. Knowledge that is not used for life, or truth mixed with evil, becomes a "spiritual marsh"—a state of profanation where truth is suffocated by lust.

### **4.2 Hydrological Cycles and Instruction**

* **Rain:** Corresponds to **Divine Truth descending from Heaven**.  
  * *Meaning:* Just as rain waters the earth to produce crops, Divine Truth flows into the mind to produce the "fruit" of good works.  
  * *Early and Latter Rain:* Correspond to the instruction of truth in the beginning of regeneration and towards its completion.  
* **Flood/Inundation:** Corresponds to **Temptation** and **Suffocation**.  
  * *Mechanism:* A flood destroys boundaries and drowns life. Spiritually, a flood is an overwhelming influx of falsities and lusts that drown the perception of truth. Swedenborg interprets the Great Flood (Genesis) not as a physical deluge, but as the spiritual suffocation of the "Most Ancient Church" by monstrous falsities.  
* **Dew:** Corresponds to the **Truth of Peace** and **Innocence**.  
  * *Context:* Dew forms in the quiet of the morning. It represents the gentle, almost imperceptible influx of celestial truth that prepares the mind for the "heat" of the day (love/temptation). It is the instruction of the innocent.  
* **Snow:** Corresponds to **Natural Truth** that is cold.  
  * *Meaning:* Snow is frozen water (truth without love). It represents truth that is recognized as fact or duty but lacks the warmth of charity. However, because it is white, it signifies the **purity** of truth. "White as snow" signifies a state of truth purified from falsity, even if it is not yet fully warm with love.  
* **Hail:** Corresponds to **Falsity from Evil** destroying the church.  
  * *Mechanism:* Hail is ice that destroys crops. It represents falsified truths (hard, cold dogmas) used to attack the good of the church. "Great hail" (Rev 16\) signifies the terrible destruction of good by the falsities of the "faith alone" doctrine.

## **5\. The Biosphere: The Vegetable Kingdom**

In Swedenborg’s taxonomy, the vegetable kingdom corresponds to the **Understanding** and its growth. Plants are rooted in the earth (the mind), drink water (truth), and grow towards the sun (love).

### **5.1 The Sacred Triad: Olive, Vine, Fig**

Swedenborg identifies a specific correspondence for the three primary agricultural trees of the Bible, representing the three discrete degrees of the church and the human mind.

| Tree | Degree | Correspondence | Fruit/Product |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Olive Tree** | Celestial | **The Good of Love** (to the Lord) | Oil (The holiness of Love) |
| **Vine** | Spiritual | **The Truth of Faith** (Charity) | Wine (Spiritual Truth) |
| **Fig Tree** | Natural | **Natural Good** (Moral Life) | Figs (Good Works) |

* **The Olive:** Corresponds to the **Celestial Church**. The oil signifies the essence of love (Charity) which heals, softens, and burns as fuel for light.  
* **The Vine:** Corresponds to the **Spiritual Church**. It represents the intellectual side of faith. "I am the Vine" (John 15\) signifies the Lord as the source of all spiritual truth. The branches are individual minds receiving that truth.  
* **The Fig:** Corresponds to the **Natural Church**. It represents the external life of obedience and kindness.  
  * *The Barren Fig Tree:* Corresponds to a state of **Hypocrisy**—having leaves (knowledge/profession of faith) but no fruit (actual good works). This state is "cursed" because faith without works is dead.

### **5.2 Trees of Structure and Perception**

* **Cedar (of Lebanon):** Corresponds to **Rational Truth** of a high order.  
  * *Context:* The cedar is tall, majestic, and enduring. It corresponds to the rational mind that organizes truths into a coherent, protective system. It represents the "intellectual" spiritual man.  
* **Oak:** Corresponds to **Sensual or Natural Truth**.  
  * *Context:* The oak is strong, knotty, and has low-hanging branches. It corresponds to the perception of the natural mind—strong and enduring, but grounded in the senses rather than high spiritual insight. To be "buried under an oak" signifies a state of natural obscurity.  
* **Trees in General:** Correspond to **Perceptions** and **Knowledges**. The root is the knowledge embedded in the memory; the trunk is the disposition of the mind; the branches are the reach of reasoning; the leaves are the specific truths; the fruit is the good of life.

### **5.3 Grasses, Grains, and Thorns**

* **Wheat:** Corresponds to the **Good of Love** in the internal will. It is the "staff of life," representing the essential nourishment of the soul (Celestial Good).  
* **Barley:** Corresponds to **Neighborly Love** (Charity). It is a grain of significant value but "lighter" than wheat, corresponding to the spiritual degree of good.  
* **Grass:** Corresponds to **Scientifics** (Knowledge) and the **Intelligence of the Natural Man**.  
  * *Green Grass:* Living knowledge that serves a use.  
  * *Burnt Grass:* Scientific truth destroyed by falsity (Rev 8).  
* **Thorns and Briers:** Correspond to **Falsities of Evil**.  
  * *Mechanism:* Thorns are defensive outgrowths that choke the plant. They correspond to the lusts of self-love and the false rationalizations that spring up to choke the "Word" (the seed) in the mind. The "Crown of Thorns" signifies the mockery and falsification of Divine Truth by the Jewish Church.  
* **Wormwood:** Corresponds to the **Profanation of Truth**. It makes the water bitter, signifying the falsification of truth until it becomes repulsive and spiritually poisonous.

### **5.4 Gardens vs. Forests**

* **The Garden (Eden):** Corresponds to **Intelligence and Wisdom**.  
  * *Meaning:* A garden is nature ordered by human (or Divine) intent. It corresponds to the mind cultivated by Divine Truths. "Eden" represents the wisdom of the Most Ancient Church where love and wisdom were perfectly united.  
* **The Forest:** Corresponds to the **Natural Man** and its dense perceptions.  
  * *Meaning:* A forest is wild and uncultivated. It represents the natural mind before regeneration—full of knowledge (trees) but disordered and potentially dark. "The beast of the forest" corresponds to the affections of the unregenerate natural man.

## **6\. The Biosphere: The Zoological Kingdom**

Animals correspond to **Affections** (feelings/emotions). While plants represent the *growth* of thought, animals represent the *life* of the will. A gentle animal corresponds to a good affection; a fierce animal to an evil lust. Swedenborg asserts that in the spiritual world, a person's affections often project themselves visibly as animals.

### **6.1 Beasts of the Field: The Good Affections**

* **The Lamb:** Corresponds to **Innocence**.  
  * *Context:* The lamb is the central symbol of the Celestial Heaven. It signifies the "Good of Innocence"—the state of trusting entirely in the Lord, like a child. The "Lamb of God" signifies the Lord’s Divine Human in its supreme innocence and mercy.  
* **The Sheep:** Correspond to **Charity** (Mutual Love). "My sheep hear my voice" signifies those who are in the good of charity and thus perceive truth.  
* **The Cow/Ox:** Corresponds to **Natural Good**.  
  * *Context:* These are beasts of burden and labor. They correspond to the affections of the natural man—duty, obedience, and the good of usefulness in the external world.  
* **The Horse:** Corresponds to the **Intellect** or **Understanding of the Word**.  
  * *Mechanism:* The horse carries the rider, just as the understanding carries the spirit.  
  * *White Horse:* Pure understanding of truth from the Word (Rev 19).  
  * *Red Horse:* Understanding destroyed by evil (violence to the good).  
  * *Black Horse:* Understanding destroyed by falsity (darkness).  
  * *Pale Horse:* Spiritual death (total destruction of good and truth).  
  * *Pegasus:* An ancient correspondence for the understanding elevating toward spiritual truths.

### **6.2 Beasts of the Forest: The Ambivalent and Evil**

* **The Lion:** Corresponds to the **Power of Truth**.  
  * *Genuine Sense:* The "Lion of the Tribe of Judah." This represents the Lord in His omnipotence of Divine Truth fighting against the hells. The lion’s roar corresponds to the power of divine revelation.  
  * *Opposite Sense:* The **Power of Falsity**. The "roaring lion" seeking to devour corresponds to the lust of self-love destroying the truths of the church.  
* **The Bear:** Corresponds to the **Natural Man** and the **Literal Sense of the Word**.  
  * *Genuine Sense:* Power in the ultimate/literal sense. The bear is strong and shaggy.  
  * *Opposite Sense:* Those who read the Word only literally, without understanding its spirit. This leads to fallacies and "bear-like" clumsiness in spiritual matters. The bear in Rev 13 signifies the power of falsity drawn from the literal sense of the Word separated from doctrine \[, S\_W73, S\_W120\].  
* **The Wolf:** Corresponds to **Avarice** and the **Lust of Destroying Truths**.  
  * *Meaning:* The wolf is a predator of sheep (charity). It signifies those who are inwardly deceitful, appearing innocent (sheep's clothing) but harboring hatred for the good of the church.  
* **The Leopard:** Corresponds to **Reasoning from Falsities** that appear like Truth.  
  * *Mechanism:* The leopard has beautiful spots (truths) but is a ferocious beast. This corresponds to the doctrine of "Faith Alone," which uses scattered truths from the Bible to construct a system that destroys the life of charity. It represents a "patchwork" of heresy that looks intellectually impressive but is internally predatory \[, S\_W73, S\_W120\].

### **6.3 Birds of the Air: Thoughts and Rationality**

Birds fly in the air (the atmosphere of thought). They correspond to **Rational Concepts**, **Intellectual Ideas**, and **Reasonings**.

* **The Eagle:** Corresponds to **Rational Intelligence** and **Acute Perception**.  
  * *Context:* The eagle flies highest and has the keenest sight. It corresponds to the rational mind’s ability to see truths from a universal perspective. In a negative sense, it can represent the "pride of own intelligence".  
* *The Dove:* Corresponds to the **Goods and Truths of Faith** and **Regeneration**.  
  * *Context:* The dove is associated with the Holy Spirit. It signifies the gentle, purifying thoughts associated with regeneration and the innocence of faith.  
* *Birds of Night (Owls, Bats):* Correspond to **Falsities** and the darkness of the mind.  
  * *Context:* These creatures see in the dark (falsity) and are blinded by the light (truth). They correspond to the state of those in "self-intelligence" who reject Divine Truth and prefer the darkness of their own conceits.

### **6.4 Entomology and Reptiles: The Sensual Degree**

These creatures correspond to the **Sensual Degree** of the mind—the lowest level that interacts with the physical senses.

* **The Serpent:** Corresponds to the **Sensual Man**.  
  * *Genuine Sense:* **Prudence** and Circumspection. The sensual degree is necessary for life in the world ("Be ye wise as serpents").  
  * *Opposite Sense:* **Deceit** and reasoning from the senses. The serpent in Eden represents the "fallacy of the senses" which seduces the rational mind (Eve) into believing that life comes from nature, not God. The serpent crawling on the dust signifies the sensual mind groveling in corporeal things.  
* **The Dragon:** Corresponds to the **Profanation of Truth** and the **Separation of Faith from Charity**.  
  * *Context:* The Dragon (a great serpent) represents the intellectual monster created when knowledge of God is used to justify evil. It specifically signifies the theology of "Faith Alone" which persecutes the "Woman" (the True Church) \[, S\_W85, S\_W120\].  
* **The Locust:** Corresponds to **Sensual Falsity** in the extremes.  
  * *Mechanism:* Locusts consume the green things (living truths) of the mind. They represent the appetite of the sensual man that consumes all spiritual understanding, leaving the mind barren (a spiritual famine).  
* **The Bee:** Corresponds to **Rational Truths** gathering Good.  
  * *Context:* The bee collects nectar from flowers to make honey. This corresponds to the rational mind gathering truths from the Word to create the "honey" of spiritual delight and use.  
* **The Spider:** Corresponds to **Cunning and Deceit**.  
  * *Mechanism:* The spider weaves a web to entrap. This corresponds to the false doctrines spun from self-intelligence to trap others. The spider sits in the center of its web, just as the evil love of self sits in the center of its false reasonings.  
* **The Worm:** Corresponds to **Infernal Torment** and the **Corporeal Sensual**.  
  * *Context:* The "worm that does not die" is the gnawing of the conscience (or the lack thereof) and the filth of the lowest desires. It represents the state of the damned who are consumed by their own vile lusts.

## **7\. The Chronosphere: Time, Space, and State**

In Swedenborgian physics, the "dimensions" of the natural world correspond to the "states" of the spiritual world. Time corresponds to **State of Life**, and Space corresponds to **State of Love**.

### **7.1 The Quarters of the Compass**

Directions are determined by the presence of the Lord (the Spiritual Sun).

* **East:** Corresponds to **Love to the Lord** (Celestial Love). The Lord is always in the East in the spiritual world.  
* **West:** Corresponds to a **declining state of love** (toward self) or the natural state.  
* **South:** Corresponds to **Wisdom and Intelligence** (Light).  
* **North:** Corresponds to **Ignorance** or the obscurity of truth (Cold/Darkness).

### **7.2 The Seasonal Cycle**

The progression of the seasons corresponds to the progression of regeneration in the individual and the cycles of the Church in history.

| Season | Spiritual Correspondence | State of the Church/Mind |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Spring** | New Birth / Peace | The first state of a new Church; Infancy; The beginning of regeneration where truth is first received with joy. |
| **Summer** | Fullness / Wisdom | The state of greatest light (wisdom) and heat (love); Mature Faith and Charity. |
| **Autumn** | Decline / Obscurity | The waning of love and faith; reliance on external memory; the "Evening" of the church. |
| **Winter** | End / Consummation | The total absence of love and truth; spiritual death; the state of "Proprium" (selfhood) without the Lord. |

### **7.3 The Colors of Creation**

Colors are the "modifications" of light and heat, corresponding to the variations of wisdom and love.

* **White:** Corresponds to **Truth** (reflecting light). It represents the purity of the spiritual degree.  
* **Red:** Corresponds to **Good** (reflecting fire/love). It represents the Celestial degree.  
* **Blue:** Corresponds to **Spiritual Truth**.  
* **Green:** Corresponds to **Scientifics** (living facts) and the Natural degree.  
* **Purple:** Corresponds to the **Celestial Love of Good**. It is the royal union of Red (Love) and Blue (Truth), signifying the Lord’s sovereignty through Love \[, S\_W124\].

## **8\. Conclusion: The Living Mirror**

The cartography presented here reveals that, in the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg, the natural world is a language. It is not a mute collection of atoms but a "living mirror" where the spiritual drama of the universe is played out in fixed forms.

* The **Mineral Kingdom** provides the foundation, corresponding to the fixed truths and loves that ground our existence.  
* The **Vegetable Kingdom** displays the growth of the mind, from the first "grass" of scientific fact to the majestic "cedar" of rational understanding and the fruit-bearing "olive" of celestial love.  
* The **Animal Kingdom** reveals the spectrum of the heart, from the innocent "lamb" of charity to the devouring "wolf" of avarice and the "dragon" of profaned religion.  
* The **Elements** themselves—sun, wind, and water—narrate the physics of the Divine presence, describing how Love (heat) and Wisdom (light) flow through the atmospheres to sustain creation.

This map demonstrates that there is no separation between the physical and the spiritual. The "World of Effects" is the "World of Causes" made visible. To walk through the natural world, in this view, is to walk through a library of Divine Wisdom, where every stone, leaf, and cloud invites the human mind to look inward and upward toward its Source.
