# **The Architecture of Hidden Divinity: A Comprehensive Profile of the Gnostic Impulse and Its Historical Mechanics**

## **Introduction: The Dual Currents of Western Spirituality**

The history of Western religious thought is frequently constructed as a linear narrative of orthodox development, a monolithic stream of institutional consolidation that defines the spiritual landscape of the last two millennia. However, running parallel to this visible history—and often intersecting with it in moments of profound cultural tension—is a persistent, counter-structural current. This alternative tradition, while diverse in its myriad cultural expressions ranging from the dusty papyri of Late Antiquity to the digital forums of 21st-century spirituality, shares a singular, cohesive architectural logic. It is a logic that fundamentally reimagines the relationship between the human, the divine, and the material world. This report provides an exhaustive profile of this phenomenon, broadly categorized as "Gnosticism" and its subsequent historical iterations.

The objective of this analysis is to isolate the "Gnostic Impulse" as a recurring mechanical system of thought.1 This system is defined not by the specific cultural trappings of any one era, but by a set of immutable structural characteristics: the rigorous depersonalization of the Divine into an abstract principle; the strategic bifurcation of the historical "human" Jesus from a cosmic "Christ" entity; the identification of material existence as a state of captivity orchestrated by a lower, often ignorant creator; and the pursuit of salvation through *gnosis*—a revelatory, intellectual self-realization of one's own innate divinity.1

By synthesizing critical historical analyses, comparative Christologies, and socio-political frameworks, we can delineate the specific "mechanics" of this worldview. It contrasts the Gnostic trajectory—which seeks to dismantle the specific identification of the Divine with the historical—against the "Incarnational" trajectory, which seeks to affirm the union of the divine and the material.2 Through this lens, we observe that the struggle between these two currents is not merely a debate over ancient dogma, but a fundamental conflict over the nature of reality, the definition of the self, and the location of spiritual authority.

Whether manifesting in the 2nd-century Valentinian schools that challenged the early Church Fathers, the 19th-century Theosophical salons that sought to synthesize science and mysticism, or the 21st-century "Spiritual But Not Religious" (SBNR) movements that prioritize self-actualization over community, the underlying mechanism remains strikingly consistent. It is a strategy of "self-glorification" cloaked in the language of enlightenment, a systematic dismantling of the external, personal God in favor of an internal, depersonalized, and self-actualized divinity.23

**Section I: The Cosmology of Captivity**

To understand the resilience and mechanics of the Gnostic worldview, one must first deconstruct its foundational cosmology. Unlike the worldview that undergirds the Judeo-Christian tradition—which posits creation as the intentional and benevolent act of a Supreme Father—the Gnostic universe proceeds from a premise of cosmic tragedy. The existence of the material world is not a blessing to be stewarded, but a mistake to be corrected.

### **1.1 Radical Dualism and the Ontological Rejection of Matter**

The bedrock of Gnostic thought is **radical dualism**.1 This is not merely a moral dualism of good versus evil choices, but a structural, ontological dualism between the realm of spirit and the realm of matter. In this framework, the spiritual world—often termed the *Pleroma* or "Fullness"—is the locus of perfection, light, and ultimate reality. It is the domain of the True God, who is described as unknowable, alien, and utterly removed from the grit of physical existence.1

In sharp contrast, the material cosmos—including the galaxies, the earth, and crucially, the human body—is viewed as a flawed, darkened, and fundamentally illegitimate existence. This view identifies the world as a "prison".1 This dualism necessitates a complete rejection of the material world's inherent value. Where other traditions might view the world as "fallen" but redeemable, or as a "theophany" (a manifestation of God), the Gnostic impulse views the world as structurally irredeemable. It is a trap, a labyrinth, or a dungeon.

Consequently, the objective of human existence within this system is not the sanctification of the body, the restoration of the earth, or the "repair of the world" (*tikkun olam*). Instead, the goal is **escape**. This premise dictates every other theological and psychological move within the system: if matter is evil, the Supreme God could not have created it; if the body is a prison, the Savior could not have truly inhabited one; if the world is a mistake, then the "God" of this world must be an impostor.1 This cosmology creates a profound sense of alienation, where the spiritual seeker feels like a stranger in a strange land, trapped in a biological machine that is fundamentally hostile to their true nature.

### **1.2 The Architecture of the Captor: The Demiurge**

The Gnostic cosmology requires a specific antagonist to explain the existence of the material prison. If the Supreme God is infinite light and goodness, He would not create a world of suffering, decay, and death. Therefore, the architect of the physical universe must be a lesser being. This figure is known as the **Demiurge** (from the Greek *demiourgos*, meaning "craftsman" or "public worker").1

The profile of the Demiurge is central to the Gnostic mechanic of "Captivity." In Gnostic systems, the Demiurge is a subordinate deity who creates the material world, often out of ignorance or arrogance, independent of the Supreme God's will. He is the "bungler," the "blind god" (*Samael*), or the "fool" (*Saklas*). Crucially, this figure is frequently identified by Gnostic systems with the **God of the Old Testament (Yahweh)**.1

Gnostic exegetes argued that a God who is jealous, wrathful, obsessed with legalistic obedience, and who declares, "I am the Lord, and there is no other," must be ignorant of the *Pleroma* above him. His declaration of supremacy is not truth, but a symptom of his blindness to the higher reality. He frames himself as the Creator and Father, but in the Gnostic view, he is the **Jailer**.1

The function of the Demiurge is to keep humanity in a state of **ignorance**. By binding human spirits to the cycle of matter, time, and law, the Demiurge prevents them from realizing their true origin in the high spiritual realms. This creates a cosmology of **captivity**, where the antagonist is not a moral tempter who incites sin (like the traditional Satan), but the very creator of the ecosystem in which humanity lives. The laws of nature, the biological drives of the body, and especially the structures of religious orthodoxy and moral law are all viewed as mechanisms of this captivity.4

### **1.3 The Mechanics of Ignorance and the Archons**

The captivity orchestrated by the Demiurge is maintained through a complex machinery of spiritual oppression. The Demiurge is often depicted as being served by a host of lesser powers known as **Archons** (Rulers). These beings correspond to the planetary spheres or cosmic forces that govern fate (*heimarmene*) and block the soul's ascent to the *Pleroma*.1

In the ancient context, the Archons were the gatekeepers of the celestial spheres, demanding passwords and secret knowledge from ascending souls. In modern iterations of the Gnostic impulse, this mechanism of control is often psychologized or sociologized. The "Archons" become the forces of "social conditioning," "religious dogma," or the "Matrix" of cultural consensus reality.3

The primary weapon of the Captor is **ignorance**. This mechanism can be understood as the "Antagonist Proprium" (selfhood) seeking to "suffocate all else".4 By enforcing a reality where the material world is the only reality, or where the external law is the only path to God, the Captor keeps the "Divine Spark" asleep. The Captor requires **mediated truth**—institutions, priests, and external books—because direct, unmediated access to the Divine would shatter the illusion of his supremacy. Thus, the Gnostic narrative is fundamentally a story of a prisoner realizing they are in a cell, and that the warden (the god of this world) has lied to them about their crime and their sentence.4

**Section II: The Anthropology of Self-Divinity**

If the cosmos is a prison and the Creator is a jailer, the Gnostic definition of the human being is the prisoner. However, unlike the orthodox Christian view, which sees humanity as a created being distinct from the Creator (a creature), Gnostic anthropology asserts that the human being—or at least the "spiritual" core of the human—is consubstantial with the Divine.

### **2.1 The Doctrine of the Divine Spark**

Central to this anthropological profile is the concept of the **Divine Spark** (*pneuma*). This teaching posits that human beings contain a fragment of the high Divine substance trapped within the gross matter of the body. This spark is not a creation *of* God; it is a *piece* of God. It has "fallen" from the *Pleroma* into the world of the Demiurge.1

This doctrine fundamentally alters the ontological status of the human being. The human soul is not a servant or a child of God in a relational sense; it is a deity in amnesia. The body is merely the "tomb" (*soma/sema*) or the "garment" that weighs down this spark. This creates a sharp distinction within the human person: the body and the psyche (soul/mind) may belong to the Demiurge and are subject to his laws, but the Spirit (*pneuma*) belongs to the Alien God and is free from the moral and physical constraints of the lower world.1

This anthropology is often elitist. Ancient Gnostic systems frequently categorized humanity into three classes:

1. **Hylics** (Material ones): Those devoid of the spark, doomed to perish with the material world.  
2. **Psychics** (Soul ones): Ordinary believers who live by faith and works (orthodox Christians), who might achieve a lesser form of salvation.  
3. **Pneumatics** (Spiritual ones): The Gnostics themselves, possessors of the spark and the saving knowledge, destined for the *Pleroma*.1

### **2.2 Salvation as Self-Realization**

Because the core of the human is already divine, salvation is not a transaction (atonement) or a transformation (sanctification) initiated by an external God. Instead, salvation is **self-realization**. It is the process of the spark becoming aware of itself.

In Gnostic texts like the *Gospel of Thomas*, salvation is framed as a turning inward. Jesus says, "When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father".1 This "knowing" is not meeting a stranger; it is remembering one's own forgotten identity.

In modern "Spiritual But Not Religious" (SBNR) movements, this anthropology is secularized but mechanically identical. Sociological analysis identifies the core motive of SBNR as "being connected with my true self".3 The "True Self" is sacralized; it is viewed as the source of wisdom and authority. The life purpose of the modern Gnostic is to "realize" this authentic self, effectively operationalizing the doctrine of the Divine Spark without the mythological trappings of Aeons and Archons. This focus on "self-realization" is a form of the "Intellectual Proprium"—a mechanism of self-glorification where the ego defines itself as God.3

### **2.3 The "I Am God" Mechanic and Narcissism**

The logical endpoint of the Divine Spark doctrine is the assertion "I am God." While often framed as a mystical liberation, critical analysis connects this mechanic to the concept of **Proprium** (Self-Love) or **Philautia**.3

The "Intellectual Proprium" operates by "elevating themselves," "glorifying themselves," and "defining... them as being God Himself".23 By erasing the distinction between the Creator and the creature, the Gnostic impulse removes the need for humility, obedience, or gratitude toward an external Other. The Self becomes the arbiter of truth, the source of morality, and the goal of existence. This correlates with the "self-focused practice" and modern psychological concepts of **narcissism**, viewing the SBNR movement as a "textbook 21st-century example" of this dynamic.3 In this state, the individual is not liberated from the self, but locked within it, interpreting their own subjective impulses as divine revelation.

## ---

**Section III: The Epistemology of Secrets (Gnosis vs. Revelation)**

The operational engine of the Gnostic worldview is *gnosis*. This term refers to a specific mode of knowing that stands in direct opposition to the "faith" (*pistis*) of the orthodox communities.

### **3.1 The Nature of Secret Knowledge**

*Gnosis* is not intellectual data acquired through study, nor is it empirical knowledge of the natural world. It is described as a **"special, esoteric knowledge"** that functions as a **"revelatory, intuitive insight"**.1 It is a suprarational encounter with the truth of one's origin.

Crucially, this knowledge is **secret**. It is not accessible to the general public or the uninitiated. Gnostic texts often employ the literary device of the "secret sayings" or the "post-resurrection dialogue," claiming that Jesus taught public parables to the masses but gave the "real" truth in secret to a select few (like Thomas, Mary Magdalene, or Judas).1 This device serves to invalidate the public teachings of the church (the New Testament) by framing them as elementary or incomplete, while establishing the Gnostic teachings as "advanced" and "full."

### **3.2 The Privatization of Truth vs. The Threefold Cord**

This emphasis on secret, internal knowledge necessitates a redefinition of truth itself. The emerging orthodox tradition of the 2nd century defined truth as **public** and **historical**. It established the "Threefold Cord" of authority to combat Gnosticism:

1. **Apostolic Scripture:** A fixed public canon (the Gospels, Paul).  
2. **Rule of Faith:** A public creed taught universally in all churches.  
3. **Apostolic Succession:** A public line of bishops tracing back to the apostles.1

The Gnostic impulse, conversely, located truth in the **private** and the **subjective**. Truth was found in the internal experience of the individual, bypassing external validation. This privatization is a strategic mechanism: it renders the individual autonomous from the community and its ethical constraints. By claiming a direct, private pipeline to the Divine, the Gnostic can dismiss the "mediated truth" of the institution as a tool of the Demiurge.1

### **3.3 Salvation by Intellect (The Intellectual Proprium)**

The shift from "salvation by grace" to "salvation by gnosis" represents a shift to **"Salvation by Intellect"**.3 In this framework, the fundamental problem of humanity is not moral failure (sin) but cognitive failure (ignorance). Therefore, the solution is not a moral act (repentance) but an intellectual act (awakening).

This creates a system of "salvation by intellect" that is classified as the **"Intellectual Form of the Proprium"**.4 It is a system of self-elevation where the "knower" is saved by their own mental capacity to grasp esoteric truths. This contrasts with the "Path of Influx," which is described as "kenotic" (self-emptying) and accessible to the simple and unlearned through charity.4 The Gnostic path is inherently aristocratic; it is for the "spiritual" few who can understand the deep things, not for the "psychic" many who rely on simple faith.

**Section IV: The Christology of Separation (Dismantling the Divine Human)**

Perhaps the most distinct—and historically consistent—feature of the Gnostic profile is its treatment of Jesus Christ. Because of their commitment to radical dualism (matter is evil) and the depersonalization of the Divine, Gnostic systems cannot accept the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation (that God became a literal, physical human being). To solve this, they employ a mechanism described as **"Splitting the Identity"**.2

### **4.1 The Tactic of Splitting: The Human Vessel and the Water Metaphor**

The "Splitting" tactic involves severing the historical person **Jesus** from the divine principle **Christ**. This acts as the primary strategy for "dismantling the 'Divine Human' correspondence".2

In this framework, the identity is bifurcated:

1. **Jesus (The Vessel):** Jesus is viewed as a man—a human vessel, an adept, a "philosopher and moral reformer," or a "saved savior." He is the container or the microphone.  
2. **Christ (The Principle):** The "Christ" (or "Christos") is viewed as an impersonal cosmic force, an "aeon," or a universal divine principle that is *not* exclusive to Jesus.2

The Water Metaphor:  
This split allows for a specific mechanical understanding of divinity. In this view, Jesus is not the source of the Light, but merely a prophet who held the Light. The Light is like water—a fluid, impersonal substance stripped of its own personality. Jesus, as a vessel, was able to hold this water perfectly, but he is distinct from the water itself.

* **Implication:** Because the Light is an impersonal substance (water) rather than a Person, it is not unique to Jesus. We, as the "true conscious beings," are equally capable of wielding this water. This reduces Jesus to a prototype or a "carrier" of the same potential that resides in every Gnostic. The divinity is in the *substance* (the water/light), not in the *person* of Jesus, effectively democratizing the status of "Christ" to include the self.

Case Study: Ancient Gnosticism (Valentinianism)  
In the Valentinian systems, this separation was explicit. The "Christ Aeon" (the Savior) descended upon the human Jesus at his baptism in the form of a dove. This Christ principle used Jesus as a vehicle for his ministry but withdrew from him before the crucifixion. This allowed Gnostics to claim that the Divine did not suffer or die. The man Jesus suffered on the cross; the divine Christ remained untouched and impassible.2 This view, known as Docetism (from the Greek dokein, "to seem"), posits that the incarnation was an illusion or a temporary occupation, not a permanent union.  
Case Study: Theosophy  
Modern Theosophy, founded by Helena Blavatsky, replicated this split. It taught that Jesus was a great initiate or "Master," but distinct from the "Christos," which is the divine principle indwelling all humans. Later Theosophists, like Alice Bailey, further formalized this by identifying the "Christ" as a separate entity, the Lord Maitreya, who merely "overshadowed" the disciple Jesus to inaugurate the Piscean Age.2  
Case Study: The Urantia Book  
This 20th-century text performs a cosmological split. It claims that Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of "Michael of Nebadon," a "Creator Son." However, it explicitly states that Michael is only one of 700,000 such Creator Sons and is not the "Eternal Son" (the Second Person of the Trinity). This effectively demotes Jesus from the unique "Lord in Ultimates" to a high-ranking departmental manager of a local universe, reinforcing the Gnostic strategy of denying the absolute identification of the Supreme God with the historical man.2  
Case Study: A Course in Miracles (ACIM)  
While purporting to be dictated by Jesus himself, ACIM utilizes the split to deliver a message of collective divinity. It teaches that "Christ" is not Jesus alone, but the "shared identity of the entire Sonship" (all of creation). The specific person of Jesus is relativized; he is merely the "first" to realize what we all are. The text uses the authority of the name "Jesus" to dismantle the exclusive status of Jesus, teaching that "God is in everyone" in the exact same way He was in Jesus.2

### **4.2 The Tactic of Renaming: Sananda and Jmmanuel**

A secondary tactic identified in the research is **"Changing the Name."** This strategy seeks to break the psychological link to the historical "Lord in Ultimates" while retaining the figure's cultural authority.2

Case Study: UFO Religions and Ascended Masters  
In the "Ascended Master" teachings and UFO religions (like the Ashtar Command), the figure of Jesus is explicitly rebranded as "Sananda." He is stripped of his Jewish context and his role as the Suffering Servant. Instead, he is recast as a "Galactic Commander" or the "Commander-in-Chief" of a flying saucer fleet. He serves within a hierarchy (the "Great White Brotherhood") often subordinate to other cosmic intelligences. This rebranding allows the movement to claim continuity with Christianity ("We love Jesus\!") while preaching a technological and hierarchical gospel that is alien to the biblical narrative.2  
Case Study: Billy Meier  
Similarly, the contact notes of Billy Meier claim that the true prophet's name was "Jmmanuel," and that "Jesus Christ" is a false name imposed by later corrupters. This narrative constructs a pseudo-history that disconnects the believer from the historical Gospels entirely, redirecting devotion to the new, "revealed" identity.2  
In all these iterations, the mechanic is consistent: the specific, historical, and unique "Divine Human" is dismantled. He is replaced by a modular component—a "Master," a "Principle," or a "Commander"—that fits into a Gnostic cosmology of self-realization and impersonal forces.

**Section V: The Two Paths of the Antagonist (The Downward Spiral)**

The research frames the "Antagonist" or "Proprium" not merely as a single external enemy, but as a root mechanism of **Self-Love** that manifests in two distinct directions. These paths are not conscious choices to "refuse freedom" or "refuse obedience," but are the **natural, ingrained results** of specific ruling loves. As complex environments form around these loves, they inevitably structure reality in their own image, creating a downward spiral away from the Love for the Lord and the Neighbor.

### **5.1 The Path of Worldly Power (The Natural Hierarchy)**

The first manifestation is driven by a **Love for the World**. When this love becomes the ruling principle, it naturally resolves into hierarchical structures where the most powerful rule over those of less power.

* **Mechanism:** This path does not necessarily choose slavery; rather, it loves dominion. It seeks to control the environment and others, leading inevitably to **external coercion** and the building of rigid institutions.  
* **The Result:** In this dynamic, **external power defines truth**. The "truth" is whatever the strongest power says it is. This creates a "slave-like hierarchy" where the individual looks outward for authority—to priests, kings, or laws—rather than inward to the Lord.  
* **The Trap:** By prioritizing the external shell, this path naturally suppresses the internal spirit. It becomes the "Institutional Antagonist" that persecutes dissent not out of simple malice, but because dissent threatens the external order that this love holds dear.4

### **5.2 The Path of Self-Love (The Gnostic Impulse)**

The second manifestation is driven by a **Love for the Self**. When this love becomes the ruling principle, it naturally resolves into internal self-glorification.

* **Mechanism:** This path does not consciously choose pride as a vice; rather, it loves the self's own vision. It positions the individual as the center of the universe, leading inevitably to the conclusion that **"I am God"** or at least the arbiter of reality.  
* **The Result:** In this dynamic, **the Self defines truth**. When we recognize ourselves as the ultimate power, we recognize our own vision of good as the only truth. This creates a spiritual aristocracy of the "knowing ones" who view their own subjective experience as superior to external revelation.  
* **The Trap:** By turning the mirror inward, this path naturally severs the connection to any external Divine Being. It results in a "hall of mirrors" where the self is worshipped as the source, isolating the individual from the genuine good that flows from the Lord.4

### **5.3 The Common Root and the Spiral**

While one path is obsessed with external law and the other with internal knowledge, they are not mutually exclusive. They exist in gradations and often mix within complex human environments. However, they share a **common root**: the **Proprium** (Selfhood) that turns away from the Lord.

* Both loves naturally lead to a **downward spiral**.  
* The **Love for the World** spirals into bondage to external things.  
* The **Love for the Self** spirals into isolation within the ego.

Neither path can coexist with the **Love for the Lord** (which acknowledges a Divine Source above the self) or the **Love for the Neighbor** (which sees the good in others). These higher loves require a fundamental turning away from the Proprium, a move that the natural gravity of self-love and worldly love consistently resists.

## ---

**Section VI: Sociological and Psychological Consequences**

The endurance of Gnosticism is not due to its complex mythology, but to its psychological appeal and its sociological utility in the modern world.

### **6.1 The Depersonalization of the Divine: Safety in Abstraction**

A central tenet of modern Gnostic-like movements is the shift from a **Personal God** to an **Impersonal Force**.2 In the "Incarnational" theology, God is a "Person" (The Divine Human) with whom one relates, debates, and loves. In Gnostic systems, God is "Source," "Energy," "Light," or "Consciousness".2

This depersonalization serves a specific psychological function: it removes the possibility of **judgment**. An impersonal energy force does not have a moral will; it does not command; it merely *is*. One aligns with energy; one obeys a Person. By converting God into a principle, the Gnostic practitioner retains the feeling of connection ("I am spiritual") without the obligation of submission ("I obey"). This aligns with the strategy of "dismantling" the "Lord in Ultimates"—removing the concrete, ruling authority to clear the way for the self's autonomy.2

### **6.2 Narcissism and the "God-Self"**

A direct link is drawn between the "Intellectual Proprium" of modern Gnostic movements (SBNR) and **narcissism**.3 If the "True Self" is God, then every impulse, intuition, or desire of the self can be sacralized as a "divine movement."

This creates a closed loop of validation. In the SBNR worldview, "sin" is reinterpreted as "forgetting how great you are." Repentance is reinterpreted as "remembering your divinity." This theology offers a powerful narcotic for the ego, validating the modern obsession with self-identity and self-expression as the highest spiritual goods. It effectively operationalizes the "Antagonist Proprium" at a mass scale, creating a culture of "self-glorification" disguised as spiritual awakening.3

### **6.3 Social Fragmentation and the Loss of Shared Reality**

Because the Gnostic truth is subjective, private, and internal, there is no mechanism for shared reality. "Clay and iron cannot mingle".2 If my truth is my secret gnosis, and your truth is yours, there is no common ground for community.

This leads to the **"Social Fragmentation"** observed in the 21st century.5 The "Trajectory of Gnostic Separation" constructs a niche of "ideological uniformity" within small cliques (the "knowing ones") while viewing the rest of the world as part of the Matrix/System (the "ignorant"). This rejection of the "external" (history, institutions, objective facts) traps individuals in the "mirrored walls" of their own psyche. The Gnostic pursuit of liberation from the "false" world ultimately contributes to the breakdown of social cohesion, as the shared "body" of culture is rejected in favor of the private "spirit" of the individual.5

**Conclusion**

The profile of Gnosticism that emerges from this deep analysis is not merely a catalogue of ancient heresies or modern eccentricities. It is a map of a recurring structural mechanic in the human spirit—a "Gnostic Impulse" that consistently repurposes the language of faith to serve the architecture of the self.

This impulse is defined by a coherent set of operations:

1. **Cosmologically**, it rejects the material world as a prison created by an ignorant Captor (Demiurge), framing existence as a trap rather than a gift.  
2. **Anthropologically**, it defines the human as a trapped "Divine Spark," collapsing the distinction between Creator and creature and establishing the Self as the ultimate reality.  
3. **Epistemologically**, it privileges "Secret Knowledge" (*gnosis*) over public history, privatizing truth and establishing an aristocracy of the enlightened.  
4. **Christologically**, it systematically dismantles the "Divine Human" by splitting Jesus from Christ, reducing the historical Savior to a vessel for an impersonal, fluid "water" of light that the human self can also wield.  
5. **Psychologically**, it serves the "Proprium" (Self-Love). Whether manifested as the **Love of the World** (leading naturally to hierarchy) or the **Love of the Self** (leading naturally to self-glorification), it creates a downward spiral that is fundamentally opposed to the Love for the Lord and the Neighbor.

From the codices of Nag Hammadi to the channelings of the Ascended Masters and the "self-realization" of the SBNR movement, this profile reveals a singular, continuous effort. It is the effort to bypass the "Lord in Ultimates"—the concrete, historical, and external reality of God—in favor of a hidden, manageable, and self-reflecting abstraction. It is the ancient promise of the Serpent in the Garden, repurposed for every age: "Your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil".6
