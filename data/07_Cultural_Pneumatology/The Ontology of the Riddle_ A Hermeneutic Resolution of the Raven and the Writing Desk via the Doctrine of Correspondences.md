# **The Ontology of the Riddle: A Hermeneutic Resolution of the Raven and the Writing Desk via the Doctrine of Correspondences**

## **I. Introduction: The Epistemological Fracture and the Riddle of Existence**

The enigmatic query posed by the Mad Hatter in Lewis Carroll’s *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*—"Why is a raven like a writing desk?"—has long been relegated to the realm of literary nonsense, a whimsical product of Victorian surrealism intended to have no answer. However, when interrogated through the rigorous metaphysical framework of the **Doctrine of Correspondences**, this riddle ceases to be a non-sequitur and reveals itself as a profound theological diagnostic. It serves as a precise analogical description of a specific spiritual state: the **Natural Unregenerate Mind**.

This report undertakes an exhaustive analysis of this riddle using the "Science of Correspondences," a worldview recovered and systematized by Emanuel Swedenborg and traced back to the "Magian Science" of the Ancient Near East.1 Within this ontology, the physical universe is not a closed system of material interactions but a "theatre representative" where every object—whether a bird of the air or an artifact of wood—functions as a "letter" in a divine alphabet, articulating invisible spiritual realities.1

The hypothesis presented here, derived from a synthesis of ancient "nature wisdom" and Swedenborgian theological physics, posits that the Raven and the Writing Desk are ontologically identical in their correspondence to the **Natural Unregenerate Mind**. Both entities, in their specific correspondential functions, exhibit the defining characteristics of this state: they are **"flat"** (operating solely on the horizontal plane of effects) and **"without life of their own"** (derivative, necrotic containers devoid of independent spiritual vitality). By mapping the "topography of the void" inherent in both the scavenger bird and the inanimate object, we unveil the "flatness" of the unregenerate state—a condition where the human intellect, severed from the "vertical" influx of the Divine, becomes a "dead" mirror reflecting only its own darkness.

To fully resolve this riddle, we must first reconstruct the cognitive architecture of the "Science of Correspondences" itself, tracing its lineage from the "Bicameral Mind" of the Paleolithic to the "Scribal" codifications of the Iron Age.3 We will then perform a forensic spiritual autopsy on the "Natural Mind," defining its parameters of "flatness" and "death". Finally, we will apply these definitions to the Raven (the animate symbol of dark thought) and the Writing Desk (the inanimate symbol of the dead letter), demonstrating their convergence in the "Science of the Proprium."

**II. The Architecture of Reality: The Science of Correspondences**

To understand why a bird might be like a piece of furniture, one must first dismantle the modern bifurcation between "subject" and "object," or "mind" and "matter." In the epistemological landscape of the Ancient Near East—and specifically within the Swedenborgian system—these categories are fluid. The "Science of Correspondences" posits a causal, immutable relationship between the spiritual realm (*causa*) and the natural world (*effectus*).1 This relationship is not metaphorical but ontological; the natural object is the physical termination of a spiritual cause.

### **2.1 The Magian Paradigm: Mēnōg and Gētīg**

The intellectual bedrock of this worldview is found in the Zoroastrian (Magian) concepts of *mēnōg* and *gētīg*, which dominated the Jewish scribal interface during the Babylonian Exile.1 The *mēnōg* represents the mental or spiritual realm—the seed, the root, and the archetype. It is invisible, intangible, yet fully real, representing the potentiality and the spiritual "cause" of all things. Conversely, the *gētīg* is the material or physical realm—the fruit, the manifestation, and the tangible. It is not a "fallen" world in the Gnostic sense but the *mēnōg* made visible and dense.

In this paradigm, a physical object does not exist independently. It is the "crystallization" of a spiritual force. A lion is not merely a biological predator; it is the *gētīg* manifestation of the *mēnōg* principle of "Power" or "Truth".4 Similarly, a raven or a desk exists only because a specific spiritual affection flows into the natural degree and clothes itself in that form. The "Science of Correspondences" is the operational logic connecting these two states, allowing the initiate to read the "Book of Nature" as a coherent text.1 This creates a "resonant universe" where the physical and spiritual are linked by vertical causality. Jewish scribes living in the Persian Empire, such as Ezra or Nehemiah, would have been immersed in this administrative and scientific ontology, viewing the world as a structured list of correspondences where specific physical signs correlated with specific spiritual outcomes.

### **2.2 Vertical Causality and the Law of Influx**

The mechanism driving correspondence is **Influx**. Swedenborg argues that the natural world is the "realm of effects" caused and sustained by the spiritual world. "Without this sustaining influx, the natural world would cease to exist, just as speech would cease without the thought that generates it".2 This establishes the primary attribute of all natural objects: **Dependency**. No natural object has "life of its own." Its "life" is entirely borrowed from the spiritual cause it containers.

When that connection is acknowledged and ordered, the object is "alive" or "significative." When that connection is denied or disordered—as in the case of the **Natural Unregenerate Mind**—the object becomes "dead" or "flat," a mere shell disconnected from its source. The "Natural Unregenerate Mind" is defined by its confinement to this **flat**, horizontal plane. It is "constitutionally blind" to the vertical dimension. It sees the *writing desk* as wood and the *raven* as a bird, failing to perceive the spiritual affections they embody. Thus, the state of "unregeneracy" is literally a state of **flatness**—a two-dimensional existence in a three-dimensional spiritual cosmos.

### **2.3 The "Flatness" of the Natural Degree**

The "Natural Degree" of reality corresponds to the physical world and the "External Man".2 Unlike the "Spiritual Degree" (which involves the "Understanding") or the "Celestial Degree" (which involves the "Will"), the Natural Degree is the plane of **Action and Effect**. Recent re-evaluations of Swedenborgian thought through the lens of modern consciousness studies have introduced the concept of **"Flat" correspondence**.

This refers to the limitations of the natural mind when it operates solely on the "horizontal plane" of sensory data and historical analogy. The natural mind compares past natural events to present ones (Analogy of History), looking "across" time and space but cannot look "up" to causes. In contrast, the spiritual mind operates on the vertical axis (Analogy of Correspondence), perceiving the spiritual cause within the natural effect. The "Natural Unregenerate Mind" is defined by its confinement to this **flat**, horizontal plane. It is "constitutionally blind" to the vertical dimension. It sees the *writing desk* as wood and the *raven* as a bird, failing to perceive the spiritual affections they embody. Thus, the state of "unregeneracy" is literally a state of **flatness**—a two-dimensional existence in a three-dimensional spiritual cosmos.

**III. The Topography of the Void: Defining the Natural Unregenerate Mind**

To solve the riddle, we must rigorously define the *tertiary* term: the **Natural Unregenerate Mind**. The research materials provide a detailed "cartography" of this state, describing it not as a neutral vacuum but as a reactive, "dead" landscape.

### **3.1 The "Dead" Sun and the Absence of Life**

The most fundamental characteristic of the natural world in Swedenborgian physics is that it is **dead**. Swedenborg explicitly describes the **Natural Sun**—the source of all physical energy—as "pure fire" that is **"dead"**.2 Its function is merely to serve as a "recipient vessel" to clothe spiritual forces in material substances. Consequently, the **Natural Mind**, which is formed from the materials and images of this dead world, is also **"without life of its own"**. It possesses no independent vitality.

* **Genuine Life:** Life, in the proper sense, corresponds to **Love** and **Wisdom** flowing from the Divine.  
* **Apparent Life:** The natural mind appears alive because it is animated by "lusts" (evil loves) or "scientifics" (facts), but without the connection to Divine Love, this activity is merely the "galvanization of a corpse."

The "Natural Unregenerate Mind" is the mind that has confirmed itself in this state of death. It rejects the Influx of the Spiritual Sun and lives solely by the light of the "dead" Natural Sun (self-love and nature-worship). It is a "vessel" that refuses to be filled, remaining a **"dark valley"** or a **"dry wilderness"**.2 This is the mind that lacks spiritual "knowledge" (Hosea 4:6), resulting in a "flat" existence where the individual is "without life of their own" because they are submerged in group identity or material concerns.

### **3.2 The Cartography of Flatness: Valleys and Plains**

Topographically, the Natural Mind corresponds to **Valleys** and lowlands.2 Mountains correspond to **Celestial Love** (High, Vertical, Near the Sun), while Hills correspond to **Spiritual Charity**. Valleys and Plains correspond to the **Natural Mind** (Low, Flat, Receptive). A "regenerate" natural mind is a "fruitful valley"—flat, yes, but irrigated by the "rivers" of truth flowing from the mountains. However, the **Unregenerate Natural Mind** is a **"dark valley"** or a "rocky plateau".2 It is **flat** not in the sense of being level, but in the sense of being **depressed**, **horizontal**, and **cut off**. It is the "Earth" without the "Heavens."

This "flatness" is further elucidated in the description of the **"modern mind"** (Historical Critical Method) as "constitutionally blind" to the soul of the text, seeing only the "flat" literal sense. It is a vision capable of analyzing the surface (the desk) but incapable of reading the message.

### **3.3 The Proprium: The Trajectory into Nothingness**

The core of the Unregenerate Mind is the **Proprium** (Selfhood). The research explicitly states that "falsity has no life of its own" and "borrows apparent existence from the truth it distorts".5 The trajectory of the Proprium—the self-centered will—is a trajectory toward **nothingness**. If one follows the Proprium to its completion, "what remains? Nothing." It is the "repetition of a void".5

This void is the habitat of the Raven, the bird of the wasteland, and the nature of the Desk, the inanimate object. Thus, the "Natural Unregenerate Mind" is defined by two primary ontological deficits:

1. **Flatness:** A confinement to the horizontal/material plane.  
2. **Lifelessness:** A lack of independent being; a reliance on borrowed or distorted energy (Proprium).

With this definition established, we can now turn to the two terms of the riddle—the Raven and the Writing Desk—and demonstrate how they are perfect correspondential embodiments of this state.

## ---

**IV. The Semiotics of the Raven: The Animate Shadow**

In the "Zoology of Affection" cataloged by Swedenborg and the Magian priests, animals are not biological accidents but "affections made articulate".6 The bird, with its capacity for flight, generally corresponds to the **Intellect** or **Rational Thought**.6 However, the specific species determines the *quality* of that thought.

### **4.1 The Raven as Dark Rationality**

The Raven (*Corvus corax*) acts as the correspondential inverse of the Eagle or the Dove. While the Eagle represents "Rational Thought and Higher Understanding" capable of gazing at the Sun (Divine Truth) 5, and the Dove represents the "Goods and Truths of Faith" 5, the Raven corresponds to **"Dark Thoughts," "Falsities," and "Destroyed Truths"**.

* **Blackness:** Its color corresponds to the absence of spiritual light (Truth). In the Swedenborgian spectrum, blackness signifies the **"darkness of the mind"** or the "obscurity of the natural mind".2  
* **Carrion Diet:** The raven is a scavenger. It feeds on the dead. This corresponds to the **Natural Unregenerate Mind** feeding on "dead" scientifics, "corporeal lusts," and the "fallacies of the senses" (the carcasses of truth). The pig, another scavenger, was taboo for the Shasu nomads because it "ate death" 3; the raven functions similarly in the aviary realm.  
* **The "Spy" of the Mind:** Swedenborg links the raven to "secret falsities" or "spying thoughts" that seek out the innocent to destroy them. This is the **rational faculty** turned against the **spiritual will**. It is the intellect used to rationalize evil—the "cunning" of the natural man.

### **4.2 The Raven of Noah: The Unregenerate Scout**

The correspondential function of the raven is most explicitly diagrammed in the narrative of Noah's Ark (Genesis 8), a text central to Swedenborg’s analysis of the "Ancient Church." The Flood represents a "suffocation" by falsities.2 The Ark represents the "container" of the Church (the regenerate state) floating on these waters. Noah first sends out a raven. It flies "to and fro" (Genesis 8:7) and does not return.

The raven represents the **falsities of the natural mind**. It flies "to and fro" because it is at home in the desolation. It feeds on the floating carrion of the flood. It finds *no rest* because it belongs to the restless, "flat" expanse of the unregenerate waters. In contrast, the dove (spiritual truth) finds no rest and returns to the Ark. Here, the raven is the **avatar of the unregenerate mind**. It is the bird that thrives in the "vastation," the bird that exists in the "void."

### **4.3 The "Flat" Note of the Raven**

Lewis Carroll’s own answer to the riddle—"Because it can produce a few notes, though they are **very flat**" 7—is an accidental intuition of a deep correspondential truth. In music, a "flat" note is one that is lowered, depressed from its natural pitch. The "Natural Unregenerate Mind" is the "flat note" of the cosmic symphony. It is the intellect **depressed** from the spiritual to the natural degree. It vibrates at a lower frequency—the frequency of the *gētīg* without the *mēnōg*.

The raven’s call is a harsh, monotonic croak. It lacks the melodic range (spiritual variation) of the songbird. This corresponds to the **"Monotony of the Proprium"**—the "repetition of a void".5 The unregenerate mind has only one song: "I, I, I." It is "flat" in its lack of dimension, "flat" in its sound, and "flat" in its topography. Thus, the Raven is **like** the writing desk because it is the **animate embodiment** of the **flat, dead, natural mind**.

## ---

**V. The Theology of the Writing Desk: The Inanimate Container**

If the Raven is the *active* principle of the unregenerate mind (Falsity), the Writing Desk is the *passive* principle (The Dead Letter). While "writing desk" does not appear in Swedenborg’s standard lists 2, its components—**Wood**, **Writing**, and **Flat Surface**—are rich in correspondential meaning.

### **5.1 The Desk as the "Dead" Container**

The writing desk is an artifact of the **Mineral** and **Vegetable** kingdoms, fashioned by human hands. Wood corresponds to "Natural Good" in a positive sense, but in the context of the unregenerate mind, it often corresponds to **"wood"** or **"stone"** idols—the work of men's hands.3 It is "dead" matter. Swedenborg emphasizes that the mineral kingdom (dust, sand, stone) corresponds to the **"Ultimate"** degree—the lowest, most fixed, and **"lifeless"** level of reality.2

* **Sand:** "Scientifics without life".2  
* **Dust:** "No cohesion and no life".5

A desk is a surface for holding **Writing**. In the Swedenborgian view, the "Literal Sense of the Word" (the text itself) is a **"Container"**.3 It is the "body" without the "soul." Without the spiritual sense, the literal text is **dead**. "The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life" (2 Cor 3:6). The "Writing Desk" is the altar of the Letter. It supports the "dead" correspondence of ink on paper.

### **5.2 The "Flatness" of the Literal Surface**

The desk is defined by its **Flatness**. It provides a horizontal plane for the act of writing. As established in Section 2.3, the "Natural Unregenerate Mind" operates on the **Horizontal Plane** ("Flat Correspondence"). It cannot see "up" (Vertical Causality); it can only see "across" (Horizontal Analogy). The desk presents a **surface** to the writer. The unregenerate mind is obsessed with **surfaces**—appearances, skin, literal meanings, physical phenomena. It is "flat" because it lacks the **depth** of the spiritual degree. The "Historical Critical Method" (HCM) is described as the ultimate manifestation of this "flatness"—meticulously mapping the "surface" of the text (the desk) while denying the "depth" of the revelation (the spirit).

### **5.3 Writing as the "Fall" from Perception**

The very existence of the "Writing Desk" is a testament to the **Unregenerate State**. According to 3, early humanity (Paleolithic/Shasu) possessed **"Internal Respiration"** and direct **Perception**. They had no need for books or desks because "the world itself was their book".3 They lived in direct correspondence. The "Fall" was the loss of this direct perception (the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind). This necessitated the invention of **Writing** and **Doctrine**—external, "dead" codes to preserve the fading wisdom.3

The Writing Desk is the **prosthetic** of the fallen mind. It is the tool we use because we can no longer *hear* the voice of God in the wind. It is the symbol of the **mediated**, **externalized**, and **flat** mode of cognition that defines the "Ancient Church" (Silver Age) and the subsequent "Jewish Church".3 Thus, the Writing Desk is **like** the Raven because it is the **inanimate embodiment** of the **flat, dead, externalized mind**.

**VI. Synthesis: The Solution to the Riddle**

We are now equipped to answer the Mad Hatter’s riddle with theological precision. The Raven and the Writing Desk are not merely "alike" in some trivial, linguistic sense (e.g., "both have a/in/e"). They are **ontologically identical** in their correspondence to the **Natural Unregenerate Mind**.

### **6.1 The Shared Attribute of "Flatness"**

* **The Raven:** Represents the **Intellect flattened** into Falsity. Its "flat notes" 7 are the monotonous frequency of the Proprium, vibrating only on the natural plane, unable to sing the "harmonies" of the spiritual heavens. It flies "to and fro" over the **flat** waters of the Flood/Vastation.  
* **The Desk:** Represents the **Cognition flattened** into Literalism. Its physical form is a **flat plane**, corresponding to the "horizontal" worldview of the natural man who sees only surfaces, effects, and containers, blind to the vertical causes.

### **6.2 The Shared Attribute of "Lifelessness"**

* **The Raven:** As a bird of prey/carrion, it represents the mind that **feeds on death** (falsities, lusts). It has **"no life of its own"** because falsity is merely the distortion of truth; it is a parasite on reality. It is the "shadow" that mimics the eagle.  
* **The Desk:** As an object of wood and joinery, it represents the **"dead" container** of the Letter.3 It holds knowledge (scientifics) which, like sand or dust, has **"no cohesion and no life"** until ordered by Love.5 It is the "corpse" of wisdom, preserved in ink.

### **6.3 The "Natural Unregenerate Mind"**

Therefore, the Raven and the Writing Desk are the **Twin Totems of the Unregenerate State**.

* The **Raven** is the **Active Void**: The mind *thinking* falsely.  
* The **Desk** is the **Passive Void**: The mind *storing* dead facts. They are alike because they are both **fragments of the Gētīg severed from the Mēnōg**. They are the "Outer Dark" where the "Natural Sun" rules—a sun that is "pure fire" and **"dead"**.2

### **6.4 The Hatter's Prophecy**

In the context of *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*, the Mad Hatter exists in a state of perpetual "Time" stasis—a "flat" loop of 6:00 PM. This mirrors the **"Time without Progress"** of the Unregenerate Mind, which cannot "regenerate" (move forward/upward) but only spin in the "flat" circles of its own madness. The riddle is not a joke; it is a confession. The Hatter asks, "Why is my mind (Raven) like my world (Desk)?" The answer is: **Because both are dead, flat, and waiting for a Life they cannot generate.**

**VII. Deepening the Analysis: Second and Third-Order Insights**

Beyond the direct solution, this investigation yields deeper insights into the nature of the Swedenborgian worldview and its application to modern epistemology.

### **7.1 The "Science of Lists" and the Necessity of the Riddle**

The "Science of Correspondences" is deeply rooted in the Mesopotamian tradition of *Listenwissenschaft* (The Science of Lists).1 Scribes believed that by listing things (Raven, Desk, Lion, Stone), they could map the mind of God. The Riddle is the **inverse** of the List. The List separates; the Riddle connects.

* **Implication:** The Mad Hatter’s riddle represents the **collapse of Listenwissenschaft**. In the "Wonderland" of the unregenerate/dream mind, the orderly lists of the scribes break down. The Raven merges with the Desk. This suggests that without the "Vertical Influx" of Divine Order, the categories of the natural world dissolve into chaotic similarity. The "Unregenerate Mind" cannot distinguish between a bird and a table because it has lost the "Spiritual Light" that differentiates essences. To the man in the dark, everything is a shadow.

### **7.2 The "Pig Taboo" and the "Raven Taboo"**

The report highlights the "Pig Taboo" among the Shasu as a rejection of "sedentary chaos" and "mud".3 The pig was "unclean" because it was a "flat-lander"—unable to migrate, stuck in the mud.

* **Insight:** The Raven is the "Pig of the Air." It is unclean for the same reason: it feeds on death and signifies the "sedentary" nature of the mind stuck in falsity (the "to and fro" without return).  
* **Implication:** The "Writing Desk" is the "Pig of the Study." It is the sedentary, fixed, heavy object that traps the mind in the "mud" of literalism. The "nomadic" spirituality of the Shasu 3 rejects the Desk (fixed doctrine) just as it rejects the Pig (fixed livestock). It prefers the **Tent** (Tabernacle) and the **Oral Tradition** (Living Word)—containers that move and breathe.

### **7.3 The "Dead Sun" and the "Black Screen"**

Swedenborg’s description of the **Natural Sun** as "pure fire" and **"dead"** 2 offers a chilling parallel to modern technology.

* **Insight:** The "Writing Desk" of the 21st century is the **Screen** (Computer/Phone). It is a "flat" surface that glows with "dead" light (pixels/fire).  
* **Implication:** The modern "Raven" is the algorithm—the "spying thought" that flies through the digital void, feeding on the "carrion" of data. The riddle "Why is a raven like a writing desk?" is the prophetic riddle of the Information Age. Why is the Algorithm like the Screen? Because both are the **Natural Unregenerate Mind** externalized into a global machine—**flat**, **dead**, and **without life of its own**, yet simulating life through the electric galvanization of the "Natural Sun."

### **7.4 The Proto-Lukan Counter-Thesis: The Raven's Desk**

A notable counter-point is found in the analysis of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke). Here, the term "ravens" (*korakas*) is emphasized in Jesus’s teaching: "Consider the ravens." This is linked to the **feeding of Elijah**—where ravens provided sustenance.

* **The Inversion:** In the regenerate context (Divine Providence), the "Raven" is transformed. It becomes a servant of the Prophet. The "unclean" scavenger becomes the agent of **Anti-Anxiety**.  
* **The Raven's Desk:** In this specific textual reconstruction, the "Raven's Desk" is the table of **Divine Provision**. It opposes the "Writing Desk" of the Scribe (who worries about law/letter). This suggests that even the "unregenerate" symbols can be redeemed when placed in the service of the Prophet (The Word).

## ---

**VIII. Conclusion: The Final Correspondence**

The investigation concludes that the riddle "Why is a raven like a writing desk?" is unlocked by the key of **Correspondence**.

| Attribute | The Raven (Animate) | The Writing Desk (Inanimate) | The Natural Unregenerate Mind (Spiritual) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Geometry** | **Flat Notes** (Monotony) | **Flat Surface** (Horizontal Plane) | **Flat Vision** (Horizontal Analogy/HCM) |
| **Vitality** | **Scavenger** (Feeds on Death) | **Artifact** (Dead Wood/Container) | **Lifeless** (Dead Sun/Proprium) |
| **Function** | **Falsity** (Dark Thought) | **Literalism** (Dead Letter) | **Void** (Absence of Influx) |
| **Motion** | **To and Fro** (Restless) | **Fixed** (Sedentary) | **Stasis** (Time without Progress) |

In the "Magian Science" of the ancients, to name a thing was to know its essence. To solve this riddle is to name the state of the soul that is trapped in the mirror. The Raven is the **Thought** of that soul (Falsity); the Desk is the **World** of that soul (Dead Matter). They are alike because they are the two faces of the same ghost—the ghost of the man who has forgotten he is a spirit.
