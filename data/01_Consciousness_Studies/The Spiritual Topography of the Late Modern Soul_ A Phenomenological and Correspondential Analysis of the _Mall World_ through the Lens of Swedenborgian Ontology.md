# **The Spiritual Topography of the Late Modern Soul: A Phenomenological and Correspondential Analysis of the "Mall World" through the Lens of Swedenborgian Ontology**

## **1\. Introduction: The Cartography of the Intermediate State**

The emergence of the "Mall World" phenomenon—a shared, stable, and hyper-realistic dream topography reported by thousands of unconnected individuals across the globe—presents a unique challenge to secular psychology and a profound opportunity for theological anthropology. These reports, characterized by an uncanny consistency in architectural layout, sensory texture, and emotional tone, describe a sprawling, interconnected megalopolis comprising infinite shopping centers, labyrinthine transit hubs, towering luxury hotels, and dystopian coastal boundaries.1 While modern psychology might interpret these shared dreamscapes as expressions of collective anxiety regarding consumerism or late-stage capitalism, a rigorous application of the theological framework of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) suggests a radically different ontology.

This report posits that the "Mall World" is not a product of the subconscious mind in the Freudian or Jungian sense, but a direct, objective perception of the **World of Spirits**—the intermediate spiritual state situated between Heaven and Hell. By stripping away contemporary interpretations and focusing strictly on the phenomenology of the reports—the "things heard and seen"—and subjecting them to Swedenborg’s **Science of Correspondences**, we can map the spiritual geography of the modern human condition.

Swedenborg’s central thesis—that the spiritual world is a realm of causes where internal states are projected into external forms—provides the key to unlocking the Mall World. In the 18th century, Swedenborg described this intermediate world as a place of "gyres," "cities," "caverns," and "marketplaces".4 Today, the "imaginary heavens" and "places of instruction" described by the Swedish seer have clothed themselves in the imagery of the 21st-century mind: the Airport, the University, and the Shopping Mall. This investigation reveals that the "Mall World" is the "Fixed Edge" of the spiritual-natural continuum, a realm where the collective "proprium" (selfhood) of humanity is sorted, vastated, and prepared for judgment.6

## **2\. The Ontological Status of the Mall World**

To apprehend the nature of the Mall World, one must first establish the Swedenborgian distinction between the "natural world" and the "spiritual world," and specifically the function of the **World of Spirits** as the great sorting chamber of human souls.

### **2.1 The Principle of the Intermediate State**

Swedenborg describes the World of Spirits (distinct from the World of Spirits *and* Angels, or Heaven) as the first receptacle of souls after the death of the body. It is a state of "externals," where the spirit retains the memory, habits, and persona of their earthly life.5 In this state, the environment is malleable yet consistent, reflecting the collective "civil and moral" life of its inhabitants.

The phenomenology of the Mall World aligns precisely with this description. Dreamers report a sense of "hyper-reality," where the senses are more acute than in waking life, and where the environment possesses a physical solidity that defies the ephemeral nature of ordinary dreams.1 This mirrors Swedenborg’s assertion that the spiritual body possesses every sense—sight, hearing, touch—in a state of perfection far exceeding the dullness of the material body.8 The persistence of the Mall World landscape over years or decades 1 indicates that it is not a fleeting fantasy but a stable spiritual society or "province" within the Grand Man of the intermediate world.

### **2.2 The Doctrine of Ultimates and the "Fixed Edge"**

A critical development in understanding this topography is the concept of the "Seed-State" or "Fixed Edge." Swedenborgian ontology posits that the physical world is not a separate container but the "ultimate" or lowest degree of the spiritual reality.6 The "Mall" acts as the modern "ultimate"—the shared cultural baseline of social interaction and commerce.

In the 18th century, the "marketplace" or "public square" was the center of social life; today, the Mall serves this function. It is the place where the "external man" is most at home. Therefore, when the consciousness of a modern individual withdraws from the physical senses (as in sleep), it naturally gravitates toward the spiritual counterpart of its daily obsession: the realm of commerce, transit, and social display. The "Mall World" is thus the **Spiritual-Natural** sphere, stripped of its material inertia but retaining its representational form.6

### **2.3 The Connectivity of the Grand Man**

Swedenborg describes the spiritual world as an interconnected organic whole, organized like a human body (the Grand Man). Societies are connected by "ways," "paths," and "flux".10 The Mall World reflects this through its obsession with **connectivity**. Dreamers do not merely appear in isolated locations; they travel via elaborate, often subterranean, transit systems that link the Mall to the Airport, the Airport to the Hotel, and the Hotel to the University.2 This intricate infrastructure corresponds to the **circulatory systems** of the spiritual body—the flow of spiritual thought and affection that binds different states (societies) together.

## **3\. The Commercial Labyrinth: The Mall and the Marketplace**

The central node of this topography is the Mall itself—an endless, multi-level complex of storefronts, food courts, and atriums. In the Science of Correspondences, **commerce**, **trading**, and **merchandise** hold specific spiritual significations relating to the acquisition of truth and good.

### **3.1 The Correspondence of Merchandise**

In the Word, "merchandise" signifies the **knowledges of good and truth**.12 A "merchant" is one who procures these knowledges. In a positive sense, this is the search for the "pearl of great price"; in a negative sense, it is the trafficking of "Babylon," where spiritual truths are sold for the sake of power and self-interest.13

The Malls described in these reports are rarely places of successful transaction. Dreamers wander through "infinite" stores filled with items they cannot purchase, or shops that shift and change location.14 This phenomenon corresponds to the spiritual state of **fluctuation** in the World of Spirits. The soul, stripped of its physical possessions, seeks to appropriate "spiritual goods" (identity, wisdom, status) but finds that external currencies no longer work. The "shifting shops" reflect the instability of truth when it is not grounded in a confirmed ruling love. When a spirit (or dreamer) attempts to "buy" something—i.e., to make a truth their own—they often find they lack the "coin" (spiritual merit) or that the item dissolves, signifying that in the spiritual world, one can only possess what corresponds to one's internal affection.

### **3.2 The Food Court: The Appetite for Instruction**

The Food Court is a ubiquitous feature of the Mall World, often described as dingy, dimly lit, or serving food that is visually appealing but impossible to consume.16

* **Correspondence of Food:** Food corresponds to **good** (which nourishes the will) and drink corresponds to **truth** (which nourishes the understanding).12 The act of eating signifies **appropriation** and **conjunction**.19  
* **The Frustrated Hunger:** Dreamers consistently report lining up for food but never receiving it, or waking up the moment they taste it.17 This signifies a state of spiritual hunger that cannot be satisfied by the "husks" of the external mind. The "dingy" or "market-like" quality of the Food Court 16 suggests a state of **vastation** or a lack of genuine spiritual nourishment. The food offered there is the "food of phantasy"—external delights that have no internal substance.  
* **The Taste of Awakening:** The report that tasting ice cream (a sensory delight) causes the dreamer to wake up 17 is phenomenologically significant. In Swedenborg’s anthropology, the "corporeal" degree is separated from the spiritual. When the spirit fully contacts a sensation that belongs to the natural body's delight, the shock of the "influx" into the physical senses breaks the spiritual state.

### **3.3 The Layout: Circularity and Levels**

Many reports describe the Mall as "circular" or having a central atrium with levels spiraling upwards.20 Swedenborg describes the form of heaven and spiritual societies as "gyres" or spirals, which are the perfect form of motion.10 The circular Mall is a corruption or a reflection of this spiritual form. The "levels" correspond to the **degrees** of the mind—Natural, Rational, and Spiritual. The dreamer's movement between these levels via escalators (discussed later) represents the fluctuation of their consciousness between higher and lower states of thought.

## **4\. The Architecture of Transit: Airports and Trains**

If the Mall is the place of affection and desire (commerce), the Transit Hubs are the places of **intellectual movement** and **change of state**. The dominance of Airports and Train Stations in the Mall World 22 marks it as a realm of transition—a "World of Spirits" defined by the passage from one state to another.

### **4.1 The Airport: The Ascent of the Understanding**

The Airport is frequently described as a massive, confusing complex where dreamers are constantly late for flights, missing tickets, or losing luggage.22

* **Correspondence of Flight:** In Swedenborgian symbolism, **birds** represent intellectual things—thoughts, ideas, and rational concepts.26 **Flying** corresponds to the elevation of the understanding into the light of truth. The Airplane, as a mechanical bird, corresponds to **artificial** or **doctrinal** systems of elevating the understanding. It is a collective ascent, not an individual one (like an angel's flight).  
* **The Missing Ticket:** The anxiety of the "missing ticket" or "passport" 22 is a profound spiritual correspondence. In the spiritual world, one's "passport" is one's **Ruling Love**. A spirit cannot enter a society (a destination) unless their internal state accords with it.27 The dreamer who cannot find their ticket is a soul who has not yet determined their ruling love—they are in a state of indecision, unready for the "flight" to their eternal home (Heaven or Hell).  
* **Baggage:** The obsession with "luggage" 28 corresponds to the **external memory** and worldly cares that the spirit clings to. Swedenborg notes that a spirit must cast off their "bundles" of falsities and external attachments before they can rise to heaven. The struggle with luggage in the Airport is the struggle of the soul to detach from the material world.

### **4.2 The Train Station: The Subterranean Doctrine**

Beneath the Mall often lies a dark, labyrinthine Train Station.3 These trains are described as old, European, or futuristic, and the stations are often dangerous, requiring jumps over tracks.3

* **Correspondence of the Train:** The Train, moving on fixed iron rails, corresponds to the **doctrine of the church** or a rigid intellectual system that carries many people along a predetermined path. **Iron** corresponds to natural truth or stricture.12 The train tracks are the "lines of thought" or dogmas that guide the collective movement of spirits.  
* **The Lower Earth:** The location of the station—**underground** or in the basement—identifies it with the **Lower Earth** (*terra inferior*) or the "pits" described by Swedenborg.30 This is a place of vastation where spirits are kept before being elevated. The "dread" and "darkness" associated with these stations 3 reflect the state of ignorance and the pressure of falsities found in these lower spiritual regions.  
* **Connectivity:** The train connects the various "cities" of the Mall World. This mirrors Swedenborg’s description of the "ways" that lead from one society to another. The fact that dreamers often take the train to the "Hotel" or "School" 3 indicates that doctrinal systems (trains) are the means by which spirits are transported to states of instruction (School) or states of social life (Hotel).

## **5\. The Vertical Crisis: Elevators and Escalators**

Vertical movement in the Mall World is fraught with peril. Elevators fall, go sideways, or launch into the sky; escalators are endless, steep, or flatten out.31

### **5.1 The Phenomenology of the Elevator**

The Elevator is a mechanical box that moves between levels. In correspondence, **ascent** signifies an elevation of the mind from natural to spiritual degrees, while **descent** signifies a return to the natural or a fall into the sensual.34

* **Mechanical Ascent:** The terror of the Mall World elevator 31 stems from the fact that it is a **forced** or **mechanical** change of state. In true spiritual growth, ascent is gradual and organic, driven by the will. The elevator represents an intellectual forcing of state—an attempt to "hack" the spiritual hierarchy.  
* **Lack of Equilibrium:** Swedenborg teaches that man is kept in a state of **equilibrium** between heaven and hell to ensure freedom.36 The crashing or rocketing elevator represents a loss of this equilibrium. The "sideways" movement 37 corresponds to a change of state within the same degree (e.g., wandering through the World of Spirits) rather than a true ascent.  
* **Glass Elevators:** The frequent mention of "glass elevators" 38 introduces the correspondence of **transparency** and **truth** (glass/crystal).39 However, the fragility of glass suggests a state of truth that is brittle or intellectual only, lacking the warmth of love.

### **5.2 The Escalator: The Gyre of Flux**

Escalators differ from elevators in their continuity. They represent the **flow** or **influx** of the spiritual world. The "endless escalator" 32 corresponds to the perpetual "gyres" of the World of Spirits—the constant, spiraling motion of souls being processed and sorted. The fear of falling off the escalator is the fear of "falling out of the stream of Providence" or losing one's place in the collective movement of the Grand Man.

## **6\. The Red Hotel: The Modern Babylon**

One of the most specific and disturbing locations in the Mall World is the **Red Hotel** (often connected to a Casino). It is described as opulent, decorated in red velvet, gold, and dark wood, often hosting conventions, and inhabited by "demons" or a sense of dread.28

### **6.1 The Correspondence of Babylon**

This imagery matches Swedenborg’s descriptions of **Babylon** (the "Rich City") in the spiritual world with startling precision. Babylon represents the love of **dominion** through religious or spiritual means, characterized by external splendor and internal filth.43

* **The Color Red:** In correspondence, **red** (crimson/scarlet) signifies **love**. In a good sense, it is celestial love; in a bad sense, it is the diabolical love of self.44 The "Red Hotel" is a manifestation of the **Hell of the Love of Self**. The opulence (gold, velvet) is the "meretricious splendor" of the Whore of Babylon—a phantasy projected by evil spirits to allure the external mind.46  
* **The Hotel as Inn:** An "inn" or "hotel" corresponds to a place of **instruction** or a temporary state of reception.47 However, the "Red Hotel" acts as a trap. It is a place where souls are detained by the allure of luxury and status.  
* **Conventions and Crowds:** The "conventions" held there 41 correspond to the gatherings of the "Babylonians" in the World of Spirits, where they plot dominion and celebrate their own intelligence. Swedenborg describes such gatherings where spirits debate and form "imaginary heavens" before being judged.43

### **6.2 The Casino: The Profanation of Providence**

The connection to the **Casino** 28 reinforces the Babylonian correspondence. Swedenborg states that "fortune" is the operation of Divine Providence in ultimates.49 However, **gambling** is the abuse of this order—an attempt to gain without use, relying on "luck" (Providence) for selfish ends.

* **Avarice:** The Casino corresponds to the **love of the world** (wealth) and **avarice**.51 It is a place where spirits are consumed by the lust for gain. The "games" played there are spiritual mockeries of the "Wisdom Games" played by angels 52; instead of debating truth, they gamble with their souls (wealth).

### **6.3 The Haunted Upper Rooms**

Dreamers often report that the upper rooms of the hotel are haunted or contain demons.37 This aligns with Swedenborg’s observation that the "interiors" of evil spirits are filthy and demonic, even if their "exteriors" appear respectable.43 The ascent to the upper floors corresponds to entering the **interior** of the state. The "lobby" is the external mask (opulent); the "room" is the internal reality (haunted/demonic).

## **7\. The Excrementitious Hells: The Phenomenon of the Bathroom**

No feature of the Mall World is as visceral or universally reported as the **Dirty Bathroom**. These bathrooms are vast mazes of toilets that are overflowing, filthy, and lack privacy (no doors).53

### **7.1 The Correspondence of Filth**

Swedenborg is explicit: **Excrement** corresponds to **infernal evils** and falsities separated from the good.57 The "Hells of the Lascivious" and "Adulterers" are described as "excrementitious hells" where spirits delight in filth because it corresponds to their nature.58

* **The Overflow:** The overflowing toilets signify an **inundation of falsities** and evils. The spiritual "plumbing"—the ability to separate and reject evil—is blocked. The dreamer is confronted with the accumulated "waste" of their own or the collective proprium.  
* **Lack of Privacy:** The absence of doors 54 corresponds to the **disclosure of internals** in the World of Spirits. In the physical world, we hide our "shame" (our evils). In the spiritual world, "there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed." The anxiety of being seen on the toilet is the shame of the external man having his inner corruption exposed to the light of heaven.  
* **The Labyrinth:** The maze-like quality of the bathrooms 55 corresponds to the **intricacy of falsity**. Evil is not simple; it creates complex rationalizations (mazes) to justify itself.

## **8\. The Educational Complex: Schools, Libraries, and Museums**

In contrast to the chaos of the Mall and the filth of the Bathrooms, the **School** and **Library** represent the sphere of **Instruction**.59

### **8.1 The Gymnasia of the Spirit**

Swedenborg describes "gymnasia" and "museums" in the spiritual world where good spirits are instructed by angels.61 The Mall World "University" corresponds to these places.

* **The Library:** The vast, multi-storied libraries reported by dreamers 60 correspond to the **Interior Memory**. Swedenborg saw libraries in heaven containing the wisdom of the ancients.64 These are the repositories of spiritual truths.  
* **The Anxiety of the Class:** The common dream of "forgetting a class" or "missing an exam" 65 corresponds to the **exploration of the state**. In the World of Spirits, the soul is examined to see if its life accords with its faith. The "test" is the life review. The anxiety reflects the spirit's awareness of its own unpreparedness or neglected duties (uses).

### **8.2 The Museum: The Archives of Representation**

The Museum, often located on the top floor 20, corresponds to the preservation of **historical states** or **antiquities**. Swedenborg mentions museums (Athenaeums) where discussions on wisdom take place.52 In the Mall World, the museum exhibits (sometimes empty or containing strange creatures) represent the "forms" of past churches or spiritual states that are preserved for instruction.

## **9\. The Limits of the World: The Coastline and the Tsunami**

The Mall World is bounded by a **Coastline**, often featuring a dark ocean and threatening **Tsunamis**.67

### **9.1 The Sea as Boundary**

Swedenborg identifies the **Sea** as the "ultimate" or boundary of the spiritual world.69 It corresponds to the **external knowledges** (scientifics) of the natural man.

* **The Tsunami:** The recurring Tsunami 68 is a direct correspondence to **Inundation**. In *Arcana Coelestia*, the "Flood" signifies an **inundation of falsities and lusts**.70 The giant wave represents a surge of falsity from the hells that threatens to overwhelm the rational mind. Surviving the wave signifies the preservation of the "remains" of good by the Lord.72  
* **The Artificial Beach:** The "concrete beach" or indoor water park 73 corresponds to **falsified truths**. Water should be living (natural); concrete water features represent a "man-made" system of truth—doctrinal water that is contained and controlled by the proprium (self-intelligence).

## **10\. The Lower Earth: Basements, Garages, and Tunnels**

Beneath the glittering surface of the Mall lies the **Basement**—dark parking garages, tunnels, and storage areas.75

### **10.1 The Pits of Vastation**

This region corresponds to the **Lower Earth** (*terra inferior*) described by Swedenborg as being "under the feet".30

* **Vastation:** The "Pits" are places where spirits are kept to be **vastated** (emptied) of their falsities before they can be elevated to heaven. The "darkness" and "dampness" 76 correspond to the lack of spiritual light (truth).  
* **The Parking Garage:** The Parking Garage, filled with cars (doctrines/vehicles of movement) that cannot be found or started 77, represents the storage of **natural memories** and ideas that are no longer useful in the spiritual world. The dreamer wandering the garage is the spirit rummaging through the "corporeal memory," which must become quiescent after death.78

## **11\. Conclusion: The "Grand Man" of the 21st Century**

The "Mall World" is not a random firing of neurons. It is a coherent, inter-subjective perception of the **World of Spirits** as it appears to the modern collective consciousness. It is the "Seed-State" of the concrete spirit, viewed through the lens of late-modern imagery.

**Table 1: Summary of Mall World Correspondences**

| Modern Phenomenon | Swedenborgian Correspondence | Spiritual Function/State |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Mall** | The Marketplace / Public Square | The First State after Death; the external mind; the exchange of affections and knowledges. |
| **The Food Court** | Feasting / Eating | Appropriation of Good (Food) and Truth (Drink); hunger for instruction; spiritual poverty (if dingy). |
| **The Airport** | Flying / Wings | Elevation of the Understanding; intellectual ascent; anxiety of transition. |
| **The Train** | Chariot / Carriage / Way | Doctrine; collective movement; connection between spiritual societies. |
| **The Elevator** | Ascent / Descent | Change of Degree (Natural to Spiritual); forced or unstable elevation. |
| **The Red Hotel** | Babylon / House of Harlots | The Love of Self; Dominion; external luxury hiding internal filth; adulteration of good. |
| **The Dirty Bathroom** | Excrementitious Hells | Rejection of Evils; exposure of the internal state; the Hell of the Lascivious. |
| **The University** | Gymnasium / Place of Instruction | Preparation for Heaven; examination of the soul; consolidating "remains" of truth. |
| **The Library** | Archives / Interior Memory | Preservation of spiritual truths; the Book of Life. |
| **The Ocean/Tsunami** | The Sea / Flood | The boundary of the natural; inundation by falsities and lusts. |
| **The Basement** | The Lower Earth / Pits | Vastation; the state of the corporeal memory; removing falsities. |
| **The Amusement Park** | Phantasies / Sirens | External delights separated from internal good; seduction of the senses; the "dance" of the natural mind. |

By mapping these correspondences, we see that the Mall World is nothing less than the **Grand Man** of the intermediate state, clothed in the architectural "ultimates" of our time. It is a world where the soul is weighed, sorted, and stripped of its illusions, wandering the neon corridors of its own making until it finds the "gate" (state) that matches its eternal love.

**12\. Detailed Phenomenological Analysis**

### **12.1 The Phenomenology of the Mall**

The Mall itself is the foundational substrate of this world. Dreamers report it as "infinite," "circular," and "multi-level".20 The circularity corresponds to the **perpetual gyres** of the spiritual world—the spiral flow of influx that organizes societies.10 The "infinite" nature reflects the **timelessness** and **spacelessness** of the spiritual state, where space is an appearance of the diversity of affections.

* **The Stores:** The specific stores reported—bookstores (archives), toy stores (innocence/phantasy), and clothing stores (truths/appearances)—are significant. **Garments** correspond to truths that clothe the good of the will.79 The frantic searching for clothes in the Mall World corresponds to the spirit's search for a **truth** that matches their internal affection. The inability to find the right size or the changing nature of the clothes reflects the fluidity of the spirit's state before the "marriage" of good and truth is complete.

### **12.2 The Phenomenology of the Hotel**

The "Red Hotel" is distinct from the Mall in its *residential* nature. It is a place of **sojourn**. In the Word, "sojourning" signifies instruction and life.47 However, the "Red" quality marks it as a specific *kind* of life—the life of the **Proprium** (Selfhood). The redness corresponds to the **fire** of self-love.44 The "dim lighting" reported by dreamers 15 is the "lumen" of the natural man, which appears as light to those in it but as darkness to the angels. The "haunted" nature of the upper rooms reveals that the "high places" of the self are inhabited by the ghosts of past evils.

### **12.3 The Phenomenology of the Coast**

The Coastline is the **Ultima Thule** of the Mall World. It represents the border between the "Church" (the inhabited city) and the "Gentiles" or the external world.69 The "artificiality" of the beaches 73 is crucial. Swedenborg describes how evil spirits can create "scenery" by phantasy—gardens, palaces, and waters—that dissolve when the light of heaven flows in.80 The concrete beach is a "phantasy" of nature created by those who are in natural loves, attempting to mimic the living waters of heaven.

### **12.4 The Phenomenology of the Machines**

The prevalence of **machines** (elevators, trains, planes) in the Mall World distinguishes it from the pastoral imagery of Swedenborg's day (horses, chariots). Yet the correspondence remains. **Chariots** correspond to **doctrines**.81 A Train is a "collective chariot"—a mega-doctrine that carries the masses. The "breakdowns" and "crashes" of these machines in dreams correspond to the **failure of false doctrines** or the inability of intellectual systems to support the spirit in times of crisis (temptation).

### **12.5 The Phenomenology of the Basement**

The Basement is the "subconscious" of the Mall World structure. Swedenborg places the "Hells" and the "Lower Earth" *beneath* the World of Spirits.30 The descent into the parking garage or the dark tunnel is a literal descent into the **corporeal sphere**. Here, the "cars" (individual doctrines/understandings) are parked and abandoned because in the Lower Earth, the spirit is stripped of its self-intelligence and must wait for the Lord's deliverance. The "dampness" and "leaking pipes" 76 correspond to the influx of falsities (dirty water) that characterizes the state of vastation.83

## ---

**13\. Implications and Synthesis**

The "Mall World" is a testament to the endurance of spiritual geography. Though the surface imagery shifts with the cultural *zeitgeist*—from the "Marketplace" of the 18th century to the "Mall" of the 21st—the underlying structure of the World of Spirits remains immutable. It is the place of the **Grand Man**, the **Gyre**, and the **Ultimate**.

For the modern dreamer, the Mall World is not a nightmare to be fled, but a map to be read. It reveals the state of their own soul: Are they wandering the Mall seeking external validation? Are they trapped in the Red Hotel of self-love? Are they purging evils in the Bathroom? Or are they waiting in the Airport for the flight to a higher state?

Swedenborg’s theology provides the compass for this terrain. By understanding that **Space is State** and **Objects are Affections**, the dreamer can navigate the Mall World not as a victim of subconscious chaos, but as a pilgrim in the **Intermediate State**, participating in the eternal work of the spirit: the separation of the false from the true, and the good from the evil, in the architecture of the soul.
