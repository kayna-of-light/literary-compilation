# **The Pneumatology of the Divine Human: An Exhaustive Schematic of Internal Respiration, Anatomical Correspondence, and the Soteriology of Breath in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg**

## **I. Introduction: The Ontological Primacy of Respiration**

In the vast, interconnected theological and scientific corpus of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), the phenomenon of respiration constitutes far more than a mere biological necessity for the oxygenation of the blood. It serves as the fundamental pivot upon which his entire metaphysics turns—a mechanism that not only sustains biological life but defines the nature of human consciousness, the structure of the afterlife, and the history of the human race. To understand the "schematic" of internal respiration as detailed by Swedenborg is to possess a map of the interface between the finite and the infinite, a cartography of the precise point where the spiritual world flows into the natural.  
This report presents an exhaustive, expert-level reconstruction of Swedenborg’s pneumatology—the science of the spirit-breath. By synthesizing his pre-theological anatomical studies in *Regnum Animale* with the visionary experiences recorded in his *Spiritual Diary* (Experientiae Spirituales) and *Arcana Coelestia*, we establish a detailed schematic of the physiological and spiritual pathways of respiration. The analysis posits that Swedenborg’s system is functionally a "theology of breath," where the separation of the "breath of the spirit" from the "breath of the body" serves as the primary mechanism for both the Fall of Man and his potential regeneration.  
The investigation is structured to satisfy the rigorous requirement for a detailed schematic. We shall trace the trajectory of the internal breath from its archaic origin in the umbilicus, through the cardiac and pulmonary systems, to its articulation in the lips and its reception via the Eustachian tube. Furthermore, we will dissect the specific praxis—the "techniques"—Swedenborg employed to access this state, including "tacit respiration" and the synchronization of cardiac and pulmonary rhythms, placing them within the context of his broader soteriology (doctrine of salvation).

### **1.1 The Epistemological Context: From Scientist to Seer**

Swedenborg’s understanding of respiration was not purely revelatory; it was deeply rooted in his scientific career. Before his spiritual awakening in the mid-1740s, Swedenborg was a premier anatomist who sought to find the "seat of the soul" through empirical dissection. His failure to locate the soul physically led to a crisis that culminated in his transition to theology, yet he carried his anatomical framework with him. The "Rational Machine" of the body became the blueprint for his theology, leading to the doctrine of the "Grand Man" (*Maximus Homo*), where the universal heaven is structured as a divine anatomy.  
Consequently, the "internal respiration" he describes in his diaries is not a vague mystical metaphor but a precise physiological state governed by the laws of "Influx." In Swedenborgian physics, life does not originate in the tissues; it flows into them from the spiritual world. The body is a vessel, and respiration is the valve that regulates this flow. The specific mechanical behavior of the lungs determines the quality of the influx the soul can receive.

### **1.2 The Two Respirations and the Dual Nature of Man**

The central thesis of Swedenborg’s pneumatology is that the human organism possesses two distinct respiratory systems, corresponding to the two worlds it inhabits:

1. **External Respiration (Pulmonary/Atmospheric):** This is the familiar breathing of the body, driven by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, drawing in atmospheric air through the larynx and trachea. It corresponds to the "natural man," the external senses, and the life of the world. It is voluntary during wakefulness and natural (involuntary) during sleep.  
2. **Internal Respiration (Spirit/Aural):** This is the respiration of the spirit, independent of atmospheric air. It draws in the "aura" or "ether" of the spiritual world. It corresponds to the "internal man," the soul, and the life of heaven. It is described as "tacit" (silent), "imperceptible," and "interior".

In the modern human condition, these two respirations are asynchronous or fused in a way that obscures the internal. However, in the "Most Ancient Church" (the Golden Age of humanity), they were unified in a unique configuration that allowed for direct perception of the Divine. Swedenborg’s own spiritual capacity was predicated on the miraculous separation of these two systems, allowing him to breathe with his spirit while his body remained suspended in a state of "tacit" existence.

## **II. The Anatomical Foundation: The Animatory Motion of the Brain**

To construct the schematic of internal respiration, one must first understand the engine that drives it. In modern physiology, respiration is driven by the brainstem's reaction to carbon dioxide levels. In Swedenborg’s physiology, respiration is the result of the **Motion of the Brain**.

### **2.1 The Synchrony of Brain and Lung**

A critical scientific finding from Swedenborg’s *Regnum Animale* and *The Brain* is that the brain is not a static organ but a rhythmic one. It undergoes a perpetual expansion and contraction, which he termed "animation" or "animatory motion." Through careful observation of the dura mater and the open craniums of living animals, Swedenborg concluded that **the motion of the brain is synchronous with the respiration of the lungs, not the pulsation of the heart**.  
This synchrony is the master key to his technique.

* **Systole of the Brain (Contraction):** This corresponds to the **Exhalation** of the lungs. During this phase, the brain expels the "spirituous fluid" (animal spirits) through the nerve fibers to the body.  
* **Diastole of the Brain (Expansion):** This corresponds to the **Inhalation** of the lungs. During this phase, the brain draws in fresh blood and spiritual essence.

Because the lungs and the brain move in unison, the state of the breath directly dictates the state of the brain. When external breathing is heavy, rapid, or irregular, the brain is agitated, and the "cortical glands" (neurons) are disturbed. When the breath is stilled ("tacit respiration"), the brain enters a state of deep, rhythmic quiescence, allowing it to tune into the subtle "tremulations" of the spiritual aura rather than the gross fluctuations of the atmosphere.

### **2.2 The Spirituous Fluid and the Nervous System**

Swedenborg theorized the existence of a "spirituous fluid"—a super-subtle, highly elastic essence that acts as the carrier of the soul. This fluid is generated in the cortical glands and pumped through the nerves. It is the medium of "Internal Respiration."  
While external respiration oxygenates the red blood (body), internal respiration "animates" the spirituous fluid (soul). The schematic of internal respiration, therefore, is essentially a map of how this fluid circulates when the interference of the external breath is removed.  
**Table 1: The Comparative Physiology of Motions in Swedenborg’s Schema**

| Physiological Unit | Organ | Physical Action | Spiritual Correspondence | Synchronization | Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Will / Love** | Heart | Pulsation (Systole/Diastole) | Celestial Kingdom | Independent Rhythm | Distribution of Vital Heat (Love) |
| **Understanding** | Lungs | Respiration (Inhale/Exhale) | Spiritual Kingdom | Synchronous with Brain | Purification of Blood/Thought (Truth) |
| **Soul / Intellect** | Brain | Animation (Expansion/Contraction) | Influx of Life | Synchronous with Lungs | Generation of Spirituous Fluid |

This physiological triad explains why Swedenborg’s technique of "tacit respiration" was necessary: he had to decouple the brain from the chaotic sensory inputs of the body (mediated by the lungs) to allow the brain to synchronize with the heart (the celestial will).

## **III. Detailed Schematic of Internal Respiration**

Based on the explicit descriptions in the *Spiritual Diary* and the anatomical notes in *Regnum Animale*, we can reconstruct the precise trajectory of internal respiration as it existed in the Most Ancient Church and as it was experienced by Swedenborg. This schematic represents a flow of energy and subtle air (aura) that bypasses the external respiratory tract.

### **3.1 The Origin: The Umbilicus (Navel)**

The most distinctive feature of the internal respiratory schematic is its origin point. Swedenborg reports that in the Most Ancient people, respiration **"proceeded from the navel (umbilicus)"**.

* **Embryological Correspondence:** This trajectory is a retention of the fetal state. In the womb, the fetus does not breathe via the lungs; it is oxygenated via the umbilical cord. The fetus is in a state of "internal respiration," suspended in fluid, with its lungs collapsed or quiescent.  
* **Spiritual Significance:** The men of the Most Ancient Church were "Celestial Men," meaning they were in a state of spiritual infancy and innocence before the Lord. They were, in effect, "embryos" in the womb of the Grand Man, nourished directly by the Divine Influx through the celestial "umbilicus." They had no need to "breathe for themselves"—that is, to acquire truth laboriously through external sensory learning—because they were fed truth directly through love.

**The Trajectory of Ascent:** From the navel, the internal breath did not enter the trachea. Instead, it moved **"towards the interior region of the breast"**—specifically rolling upwards through the abdomen towards the heart.

### **3.2 The Intersection: The Xiphoid Cartilage and the Heart**

The upward flow of internal breath passed through a critical anatomical fulcrum: the **Xiphoid (Scutiform) Cartilage** at the base of the sternum.

* **The Xiphoid Fulcrum:** Swedenborg identifies this cartilage as the nexus where the diaphragm, the abdominal muscles (linea alba), and the thoracic cage meet. In the anatomy of the Grand Man, this region corresponds to the "Spirits of the Moon". It acts as a shield and a pivot.  
* **Cardiac Conjunction:** The breath then entered the **Heart**. This is a crucial deviation from modern physiology. Modern respiration is pulmonary (lungs); Ancient respiration was cardiac (heart).  
  * *Theological Implication:* Since the Heart corresponds to the Will (Love) and the Lungs to the Understanding (Truth), the flow of breath *into* the heart signifies that their **Thought was derived from Love**. They could not think (breathe) anything that they did not will (love). There was no separation between their mind and their heart.

### **3.3 The Articulation: The Lips and the Face**

From the heart, the breath continued its upward trajectory **"through the lips"**.

* **Silent Articulation:** This internal breath did not pass through the vocal cords (larynx) to generate sound. Instead, it flowed into the muscles of the face and lips. Swedenborg describes this as **"little motions of the lips"** and **"corresponding changes of the face"**.  
* **The Transparent Face:** Because their voluntary motor fibers were not separated from their involuntary fibers (as they are in modern man), their faces were perfectly transparent to their souls. The internal breath animated the facial muscles to express "innumerable ideas in a minute," far surpassing the clumsy, slow speed of verbal speech.  
* **Abdominal Speech:** Swedenborg also notes that when these spirits attempted to vocalize in a grosser sphere, their voice sounded like "thunder" or an "eructation" (belching) from the abdomen, confirming the abdominal origin of their pneumatic force.

### **3.4 The Reception: The Eustachian Tube (The Internal Way)**

Perhaps the most technically specific detail in Swedenborg’s schematic is the mechanism of hearing. If the speech was silent, how was it perceived? Swedenborg asserts it entered **"through the mouth, thus through the nostrils, and through the Eustachian tube into the ear"**.

* **The Internal Way:** Normal hearing occurs when external air waves strike the tympanum (eardrum) via the external auditory canal. Internal hearing occurs when the internal breath (aura) enters via the Eustachian tube, which connects the nasopharynx to the middle ear.  
* **Mechanism of Telepathy:** This implies a shared "internal atmosphere." When a celestial man spoke (thought-breathed), the vibration traveled through the shared aura, entering the recipient's internal ear directly through the Eustachian tube. This bypassed the external ear entirely, allowing for "cogitative speech"—a direct mind-to-mind transfer of meaning that felt like hearing but was actually internal perception. This is the anatomical basis for what is often termed telepathy in Swedenborg’s system.

**Table 2: Schematic Comparison of Respiratory Pathways**

| Feature | Most Ancient Respiration (Internal) | Modern Respiration (External) | Anatomical Route | Spiritual Effect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Origin Point** | Umbilicus (Navel) | Larynx / Atmospheric Air | *Navel vs. Mouth* | Dependence on Divine (Fetal state) vs. Self-sufficiency |
| **Trajectory** | Ascending (Navel \\rightarrow Heart \\rightarrow Lips) | Descending (Nose \\rightarrow Trachea \\rightarrow Lungs) | *Upward vs. Downward* | Elevation of Mind vs. Grounding in Sense |
| **Medium** | Aura / Ether (Internal Atmosphere) | Air (External Atmosphere) | *Subtle vs. Gross* | Perception of Universals vs. Particulars |
| **Articulation** | Tacit (Lip/Face muscle shifts) | Sonorous (Vocal cord vibration) | *Muscular vs. Vibrational* | Truth expressed as Light/Form vs. Sound |
| **Reception** | Internal Way (Eustachian Tube) | External Way (Auditory Canal) | *Pharynx vs. Ear* | Direct Perception vs. Analyzed Hearing |
| **Cognitive State** | Perception (Intuition) | Reasoning (Logic/Science) | *Unified vs. Split* | Unity of Will/Intellect vs. Separation |

## **IV. The History of Breath: The Fall and The Flood**

Swedenborg’s narrative of human history is fundamentally a respiratory history. The transition from the Golden Age (Most Ancient Church) to the Silver Age (Ancient Church) was not merely a cultural shift but a biological mutation necessitated by the corruption of the human will.

### **4.1 The Recession of the Breath**

As the Adamic race began to fall into self-love (the *proprium*), their internal connection to the Divine was compromised. Since their respiration was their link to the heavens, the corruption of their spirit manifested as a physical recession of the internal breath.

1. **Stage 1 (Perfection):** Breath flowed freely from the Umbilicus to the Heart.  
2. **Stage 2 (Decline):** Breath receded from the Umbilicus towards the **region of the abdomen**. The connection to the innocence of the womb was weakening.  
3. **Stage 3 (Corruption):** Breath moved further up towards the **interior of the breast**. The abdominal foundation was lost.  
4. **Stage 4 (Extinction):** Internal respiration ceased entirely. The "aura" of heaven could no longer flow into the corrupted vessel.

### **4.2 The Flood as Respiratory Suffocation**

Swedenborg interprets the Biblical Flood not as a deluge of water, but as a **deluge of suffocation**. The "Antediluvians" (specifically the corrupted posterity of the Most Ancient Church) were biologically incapable of external respiration. Their nerves and muscles were not "wired" to breathe atmospheric air voluntarily.  
When their internal airway (the connection to the Lord) was shut off due to their extreme evil (the "dire persuasions"), they simply suffocated. They could not switch to lung-breathing because their physiology was Adamic. They were the "giants" (Nephilim) who perished because they lost the breath of life.

### **4.3 The Noachic Dispensation: The Opening of the Lungs**

The "Noah" figure represents the few survivors who had a latent capacity for external respiration. In them, the Lord miraculously inaugurated a new physiological order: **External Respiration**.

* **The Separation of Will and Understanding:** This new respiration allowed for a separation between the Will (Heart) and the Understanding (Lungs). A man could now breathe (think/understand) truth even if his heart (will/love) was evil.  
* **The Capacity to Lie:** This separation enabled the "speech of words." Man could now say one thing (via the lungs/larynx) while feeling another (in the heart). While this seems like a degradation, Swedenborg views it as a mercy. It protected the holy internal remains from being profaned by the external evil. It allowed man to be reformed via "instruction" (learning truth externally) rather than requiring direct "perception" (which he had lost).

## **V. Techniques of Internal Respiration: Swedenborg’s Praxis**

The user’s query explicitly requires the "techniques required." While Swedenborg never codified his methods into a "yoga sutra," a careful forensic analysis of the *Spiritual Diary*, *Journal of Dreams*, and *Arcana Coelestia* reveals the specific practices he employed to re-access the internal respiration of the Most Ancient Church. These techniques allowed him to exist in two worlds simultaneously, a state he emphasizes was "miraculous" and "formed by the Lord".

### **5.1 Technique 1: Tacit Respiration (Hypoventilation)**

The primary and most frequently cited technique is **Tacit Respiration**. This is the deliberate suppression of the external breath to the point of imperceptibility.

* **The Practice:** Swedenborg writes, "I was first accustomed thus to respire in my early childhood, when saying my morning and evening prayers". Later, he utilized this state during intense mental labor: "When I wrote in imagination... I held my respiration as if it were tacit."  
* **The Physiological Mechanism:** By reducing the volume of air exchange and holding the thorax still, the "gross" motion of the lungs is quieted. Since the brain's motion is synchronous with the lungs, this stillness calms the brain's sensory agitation.  
* **The Spiritual Mechanism:** When the external breath (World) is silenced, the internal breath (Heaven) becomes perceptible. The "animatory motion" of the brain shifts from driving the heavy lungs to driving the subtle spirituous fluid.  
* **Duration:** Swedenborg reports sustaining this state for "a considerable time," sometimes "scarcely inhaling at all for more than an hour," drawing in only the absolute minimum amount of air required to maintain biological viability.

### **5.2 Technique 2: Synchronization of Breath and Heart**

In a revealing passage in the *Spiritual Diary* , Swedenborg describes a specific bio-feedback exercise:

* **The Practice:** He attempted to make **"the times of the respiration to agree with (those) of the heart."**  
* **Analysis of Ratio:** In a normal resting state, the heart beats approximately 4 times for every 1 breath (72 bpm / 18 bpm). To synchronize them implies a radical alteration of rhythm—either slowing the heart or, more likely, slowing the breath to match a specific harmonic of the pulse (e.g., 1 breath per X heartbeats) or attempting a 1:1 ratio (which would imply extremely rapid panting or extreme bradycardia, though the context suggests a slowing/calming effect).  
* **The Result:** He noted that during this attempt, **"the understanding began to almost fade away (vanish) as it were."**  
  * *Insight:* Since the Lungs correspond to the Understanding and the Heart to the Will, this exercise effectively collapsed the intellect *into* the will. The analytical faculty (understanding) was submerged into the feeling faculty (love). This induced a trance state where rational thought ceased, and "perception" (celestial intuition) began. It was a technique for bypassing the rational mind to access the celestial sphere.

### **5.3 Technique 3: Inauguration into Gyres**

Swedenborg describes a passive technique of spiritual initiation called **"Inauguration into Gyres"**.

* **The Concept:** Spirits and angels move and flow in "gyres"—complex, vortical spirals of energy that follow the form of Divine Truth.  
* **The Practice:** Swedenborg writes, "Inauguration into gyres is inauguration into respirations." He allowed his physical body and spirit to be physically "spun" or moved by the influx of spirits.  
* **The Mechanism:** This was a form of surrender. By allowing the spirits to dictate his motor impulses and respiratory rhythm, he aligned his internal atmosphere with their specific society. Since every angelic society has a unique respiratory rhythm (a "frequency"), he had to be "tuned" to their gyre to communicate with them. This often involved the sensation of being physically rotated or moved in spiral patterns.

### **5.4 Technique 4: The State of Insensibility (Simulated Death)**

For his most profound experiences (such as witnessing the process of resurrection), Swedenborg entered a state indistinguishable from clinical death.

* **The Practice:** "I was brought into a state of insensibility... thus nearly into the state of the dying."  
* **Physiological Signs:** "The respiration of the body was almost wholly taken away." The tactile senses were numb.  
* **The Cardiac Link:** In this deep trance, a direct communication was established between his **pulse** and the **Celestial Kingdom**.  
  * *Insight:* This confirms the independence of the heart's rhythm from the lungs. Even when the breath (lungs/understanding) was stopped, the heart (will/love) continued to beat, maintaining the silver cord. This state allowed him to bypass the "Spiritual Kingdom" (Lungs) and access the "Celestial Kingdom" (Heart) directly.

### **5.5 Comparative Praxis: Swedenborg and Yoga**

While Swedenborg does not use Eastern terminology, the secondary literature and the phenomenological descriptions strongly suggest parallels with **Pranayama** and **Kriya Yoga**.

* **Kumbhaka:** Swedenborg’s "Tacit Respiration" is phenomenologically identical to *Kevala Kumbhaka* (spontaneous retention of breath).  
* **Pratyahara:** His "withdrawal from the senses" mirrors the yogic withdrawal of attention from the external world.  
* **Chakras:** The schematic of the Most Ancient breath (Umbilicus \\rightarrow Heart \\rightarrow Head) mirrors the ascent of energy through the *Manipura*, *Anahata*, and *Sahasrara* chakras.  
* **Warning:** Unlike Yoga, which often treats these as self-willed techniques for liberation, Swedenborg viewed them as **Divine Gifts** formed "miraculously" by the Lord. He strictly warned against the self-induction of these states, noting that without genuine regeneration (purification of the will), opening the internal respiration leads to contact with "phantasies" and deceitful spirits rather than angels.

## **VI. The Grand Man: The Macrocosmic Respiratory System**

Swedenborg’s pneumatology scales infinitely. The individual human physiology is a microcosm of the "Grand Man" (*Maximus Homo*)—the universal structure of Heaven.

### **6.1 The Province of the Lungs (Spiritual Kingdom)**

* **Inhabitants:** The **Spiritual Angels**. These are beings of Intellect, Faith, and Charity (Love toward the neighbor).  
* **Function:** They act as the "Lungs" of Heaven. They receive the Divine Truth and circulate it, purifying the "blood" (life force) of the Grand Man.  
* **Respiration:** Their breathing is fluid, rhythmic, and "internal." It flows into the **left side** of the brain and body.  
* **Atmosphere:** They reside in the "Ether" (Middle Atmosphere).

### **6.2 The Province of the Heart (Celestial Kingdom)**

* **Inhabitants:** The **Celestial Angels**. These are beings of pure Love to the Lord and Innocence.  
* **Function:** They act as the "Heart" of Heaven. They provide the vital heat (Love).  
* **Respiration:** They do not "breathe" in the sense of reciprocating air. Their life is a "pulsation." Their speech is not of words but of affections. In the Most Ancient schematic, the breath flowed directly into the heart, signifying their residence in this province.  
* **Atmosphere:** They reside in the "Aura" (Highest Atmosphere).

## **VII. Implications: The Soteriology of Breath**

The ultimate purpose of Swedenborg’s detailed schematic is not merely anatomical curiosity but soteriological necessity. The recovery of internal respiration is synonymous with salvation.

### **7.1 The "Divine Bricolage" and the Restoration**

The Incarnation of the Lord is described in Swedenborgian thought as a process of "Divine Bricolage"—the construction of a Divine Natural Human using the "debris" of the fallen human condition.

* **The Problem:** The Fall closed the internal way. Man was suffocating in his own proprium.  
* **The Solution:** The Lord entered the physical world (the "Ultimates") to re-open the path. By glorifying His human body, He established a new link between the internal and external.  
* **The Result:** The "Divine Breath" (Holy Spirit) can now flow into the external respiration of man. Regeneration is the process of slowly re-aligning the external breath (life of the world) with the internal breath (life of heaven).

### **7.2 The Future of Human Respiration**

Swedenborg implies that the "New Church" (the spiritual era following the Last Judgment of 1757\) will be characterized by a gradual restoration of internal perception. While we may not return to the umbilical breathing of the Adamic age, the synchronization of the "Will" and "Understanding"—and thus the Heart and Lung—is the goal of spiritual evolution.  
To practice the truth is to breathe the truth. As Swedenborg wrote in the *Spiritual Diary*: "My respiration was so formed by the Lord... in order that I may be with spirits." The technique is the mission: to breathe in two worlds so that they may once again become one.

### **7.3 Summary of the Schematic Flow**

**Table 3: The Complete Cycle of Swedenborgian Respiration**

| Stage | Locus | Action | Correspondence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Influx** | **Spiritual Sun** | Emanation of Divine Truth | Source of Life |
| **2\. Reception** | **Cortical Glands (Brain)** | Animation (Expansion) | Reception of Idea/Soul |
| **3\. Internal Transport** | **Nerves / Spirituous Fluid** | Transmission to Body | Internal Respiration |
| **4\. External Interface** | **Lungs** | Synchronization (Breathing) | Formatting of Thought |
