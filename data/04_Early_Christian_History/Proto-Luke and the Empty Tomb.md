# **The Forensic Stratigraphy of the Resurrection: A Critical Reconstruction of the Tomb Narrative in Proto-Luke and the Marcionite Witness**

## **1\. Introduction: The Synoptic Aporia and the Stratigraphy of the Tomb**

The narrative of the empty tomb, situated at the nexus of history, theology, and literary invention, constitutes the "ground zero" of the Christian kerygma. Yet, beneath the polished surface of the canonical Gospels lies a complex, fractured bedrock of textual variants, lost sources, and fierce theological polemics. Among the Synoptics, the Gospel of Luke presents a unique enigma. Its resurrection narrative (Luke 24\) is a tapestry woven from divergent threads: the narrative framework of Mark, the sayings tradition of Q, and a distinct, often mysterious source known as "L." Within this matrix, the question of "Proto-Luke"—a hypothetical early draft or source document preceding the canonical Gospel—looms large.

This report undertakes a rigorous, forensic analysis to determine the probability that the empty tomb narrative was present in Proto-Luke. To do so, it must transcend the traditional boundaries of the Two-Source Hypothesis and engage with the "New Marcionite Paradigm" advanced by scholars such as Matthias Klinghardt, Jason BeDuhn, and Markus Vinzent. These researchers argue that the *Evangelion* of Marcion (c. 140 CE) was not a mutilation of canonical Luke, but a witness to a pre-canonical "Proto-Luke." If this is true, the textual variance between Marcion’s gospel and canonical Luke becomes the primary data set for reconstructing the earliest Christian narrative of the resurrection.

The investigation will proceed through a stratified excavation of the text. First, it will define the contours of the Proto-Luke hypothesis, contrasting the early 20th-century models of B.H. Streeter and Vincent Taylor with the modern text-critical reconstruction of the Marcionite *Evangelion*. Second, it will perform a verse-by-verse forensic analysis of Luke 24:1–12, utilizing the "Western Non-Interpolations" and patristic citations to isolate later theological accretions from the primitive substrate. Third, it will analyze the theological trajectory from "Spiritual Resurrection" (Pauline/Jamesian) to "Physical Resuscitation" (Anti-Docetic), determining whether the empty tomb served as a historical datum or a later apologetic device.

The objective is to strip away the layers of second-century orthodox redaction—added to combat Gnosticism and Marcionism—and expose the original "Jamesian" or "Proto-Lukan" narrative. Was the tomb in Proto-Luke? If so, was it empty, and what did that emptiness signify before the "flesh and bones" of orthodoxy were grafted onto the text?

**2\. The Evolution of the Proto-Luke Hypothesis: From Streeter to Marcion**

To assess the contents of Proto-Luke, one must first establish its identity. The term "Proto-Luke" has designated two distinct but related concepts in the history of scholarship: the "Q \+ L" hypothesis of B.H. Streeter and the "Pre-Canonical Luke" of modern Marcionite studies.

### **2.1 The Streeter-Taylor Model: The "Q \+ L" Nexus**

In his seminal work *The Four Gospels* (1924), B.H. Streeter challenged the prevailing view that Luke was merely a revision of Mark augmented by Q. Streeter observed that if one excised the Markan material from Luke, the remaining non-Markan sections (Q and L) did not fall apart into disparate fragments but formed a coherent, continuous narrative.1

Streeter argued that the author of the Third Gospel first combined Q (sayings) and L (special material) into a document he called **Proto-Luke**. This document, he posited, was a complete gospel in its own right, beginning with the dateline of Luke 3:1 (the fifteenth year of Tiberius) and concluding with a non-Markan passion and resurrection narrative.2 Only later did the evangelist encounter the Gospel of Mark and insert blocks of Markan material into this existing framework.

**Vincent Taylor**, a staunch proponent of this view, dedicated extensive research to the Lukan Passion Narrative (Luke 22–24). Taylor argued that the passion story in Luke was not a redaction of Mark but a distinct, independent source (L) that paralleled Mark’s account but contained unique details (e.g., the trial before Herod, the "daughters of Jerusalem," and the distinct resurrection appearances).4 For Taylor and Streeter, the resurrection narrative of Luke 24 was fundamentally non-Markan. They posited that while Mark 16:1–8 ends abruptly with the women fleeing in silence, Luke’s narrative continues into the appearances, suggesting an independent source tradition.

However, regarding the specific pericope of the empty tomb (Luke 24:1–12), Streeter was cautious. He acknowledged the strong verbal parallels between Luke 24:1–10 and Mark 16:1–8, leading him to suggest that in this specific section, the evangelist may have assimilated his account to Mark, or that Proto-Luke’s original tomb story (if it existed) was heavily overwritten.6 This ambivalence left a critical gap: Did the "L" source (Proto-Luke) originally have an empty tomb, or was the tomb narrative a Markan importation into a source that originally moved directly from death to spiritual appearances?

### **2.2 The Marcionite Turn: Proto-Luke as the *Evangelion***

In recent decades, the Proto-Luke hypothesis has been radically reformulated. The focus has shifted from hypothetical source reconstruction to the concrete textual evidence of the *Evangelion* used by Marcion of Sinope.

The Church Fathers, principally Tertullian and Epiphanius, accused Marcion of "mutilating" the Gospel of Luke to suit his Gnostic-dualist theology. This "Patristic Hypothesis"—that Marcion cut Luke—was the consensus for centuries. However, scholars like **Jason BeDuhn** (*The First New Testament*), **Matthias Klinghardt** (*The Oldest Gospel*), and **Markus Vinzent** have revived and scientifically fortified the "Schwegler Hypothesis": that Marcion’s gospel represents an earlier version of Luke, and that canonical Luke is a later expansion of Marcion’s text.7

In this model, "Proto-Luke" is no longer a hypothetical construct of Q \+ L; it is the *Evangelion* itself.

* **BeDuhn’s Analysis:** BeDuhn argues that the differences between Luke and Marcion cannot be explained solely by Marcion’s theological editing. Many "omissions" in Marcion are simply absences of material that had not yet been added to the Lukan tradition. He posits that Marcion and Luke share a common source, a "Proto-Luke," which Marcion preserved more faithfully than the canonical redactor.9  
* **Klinghardt’s Reconstruction:** Matthias Klinghardt goes further, arguing that the *Evangelion* (which he designates \*Ev) was the very first gospel, preceding even Mark. In his massive two-volume reconstruction, he argues that canonical Luke is a direct expansion of \*Ev. Crucially, Klinghardt argues that the resurrection narrative in \*Ev included the empty tomb but lacked specific theological elaborations found in canonical Luke.8

### **2.3 The "Western" Text as the Bridge**

The link between Streeter’s Proto-Luke and the Marcionite *Evangelion* is found in textual criticism. The "Western" text-type (represented primarily by **Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis** and the Old Latin manuscripts **\[it\]**) frequently preserves shorter readings in the Gospel of Luke. Westcott and Hort famously identified these as **"Western Non-Interpolations"**—passages present in the Alexandrian text (B, Aleph) but absent in the Western text.14

They argued that these shorter Western readings were original and that the longer Alexandrian readings were later interpolations (additions). A statistically significant cluster of these "Non-Interpolations" occurs in **Luke 24**, the chapter of the resurrection. This suggests that the text of the resurrection was unstable and subject to rapid theological expansion in the second century.

The convergence is striking:

1. **Streeter:** Proto-Luke is the base; Mark is added later.  
2. **Marcion:** The *Evangelion* is the base; Canonical Luke adds material later.  
3. **Western Text:** The shorter text (D) is the base; Alexandrian text adds material later.

By triangulating these three lines of evidence, we can reconstruct the primitive "Proto-Lukan" tomb narrative with a high degree of probability. The following analysis operates on the premise that where the Western text and Marcion agree against the canonical/Alexandrian text, we are looking at the original Proto-Luke.

## ---

**3\. Forensic Stratigraphy: Excavating the Tomb Narrative (Luke 24:1–12)**

We will now dissect Luke 24:1–12 verse by verse, analyzing the textual variants, Marcionite attestations, and source-critical markers to determine the content of Proto-Luke.

### **3.1 The Arrival and the Stone (Luke 24:1–2)**

*Canonical Text:* "But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb."

* **Attestation in Marcion:** Both Tertullian and Epiphanius are silent regarding verses 1–2, but their silence usually implies presence (they commented primarily on what they disputed). BeDuhn includes these verses in his reconstruction of the *Evangelion* but notes that the specific wording may have varied.17  
* **Markan Dependence:** The phrase "rolled away" (*apokekylismenon*) and the mention of spices (*arōmata*) strongly echo Mark 16:1–4. If Proto-Luke (as Streeter thought) was independent, this section shows heavy Markan influence. However, if Klinghardt is correct that \*Ev preceded Mark, then Mark borrowed this from Proto-Luke.  
* **Conclusion:** Proto-Luke almost certainly contained the narrative of the women arriving at the tomb. The narrative logic requires an arrival before the discovery.

### **3.2 The Missing Body and the "Lord Jesus" (Luke 24:3)**

*Canonical Text:* "...but when they went in they did not find the body **of the Lord Jesus**."

* **Textual Variant (Western Non-Interpolation):** The phrase **"of the Lord Jesus"** (*tou kyriou Iēsou*) is **omitted** by Codex Bezae (D) and the Old Latin manuscripts (a, b, d, e, ff², l, r¹).16  
  * **Implication:** The original text read simply: "they did not find the body."  
* **Scientific Analysis:** The title "Lord Jesus" is exceptionally rare in the Gospels (used mostly in Acts). Its presence here in the Alexandrian text signals a later liturgical or high-Christological expansion.  
* **Marcionite Witness:** Marcion generally used "Lord" or "Isoua," but the omission in the Western text suggests the primitive Proto-Luke lacked the theological title here. The simple statement of the missing body is the stark, historical core.  
* **Proto-Luke Probability:** High probability that Proto-Luke contained "they did not find the body," but **without** the title "Lord Jesus."

### **3.3 The Angelic Theophany (Luke 24:4–5)**

*Canonical Text:* "While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel... said to them, 'Why do you seek the living among the dead?'"

* **Lukan vs. Markan:** Mark 16:5 features "a young man" (*neaniskon*) sitting. Luke features "two men" (*andres dyo*) standing. This divergence is critical. It suggests that Proto-Luke was not simply copying Mark here. The "two men" motif is characteristic of Luke-Acts (e.g., the Transfiguration, the Ascension in Acts 1:10).  
* **Marcionite Reconstruction:** Epiphanius (Scholion 76\) and Tertullian (Adv. Marc. 4.43.2) verify the presence of the angelic question in Marcion: *"Why do you seek the living among the dead?"*.7  
* **The "Living One":** The phrase *ton zōnta* (the living one) is pivotal. It redirects attention from the corpse to the living reality of the Spirit/Christ. This fits the "Jamesian/Pauline" theology of a living spiritual presence rather than a resuscitated corpse.

### **3.4 The Interpolated Kerygma (Luke 24:6)**

*Canonical Text:* **"He is not here, but has been raised.** Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee..."

* **Textual Variant (Western Non-Interpolation):** The crucial proclamation **"He is not here, but has been raised"** (*ouk estin hōde, alla ēgerthē*) is **omitted** by Codex Bezae (D) and the Old Latin manuscripts (a, b, d, e, ff², l, r¹).14  
  * **Significance:** Westcott and Hort argued that this phrase was inserted by later scribes to harmonize Luke with Mark 16:6 and Matthew 28:6.  
* **Proto-Luke Reconstruction:** If the Western text preserves Proto-Luke, then **Proto-Luke did not contain the explicit announcement of the resurrection at the tomb.**  
  * **The Original Reading:** The text would flow directly from the question to the reminder: *"Why do you seek the living among the dead? Remember how he told you..."*  
  * **Theological Implication:** In Proto-Luke, the "empty tomb" is not interpreted immediately as "resurrection." It remains an ambiguous sign. The women are told not that "he is risen" (a completed fact), but to *remember* his words. The focus is on **anamnesis** (memory/teaching) rather than **kerygma** (proclamation). This creates a "quieter" narrative where faith must be recovered through memory, not forced by a missing body.

### **3.5 The Galilee Redirection (Luke 24:6–8)**

*Canonical Text:* "...Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee..."

* **Markan Divergence:** Mark 16:7 commands the disciples to *go* to Galilee ("He is going before you to Galilee"). Luke 24:6 changes this to a memory *of* Galilee ("while he was still in Galilee").  
* **Lukan Geography:** This alteration is fundamental to Luke’s theology, which centers the resurrection appearances and the beginning of the church exclusively in Jerusalem.  
* **Proto-Luke:** This modification must belong to the earliest layer of the Lukan tradition (Proto-Luke) because the entire subsequent narrative (Emmaus, Jerusalem appearances) depends on the disciples *not* going to Galilee. If Marcion’s gospel is Proto-Luke, it contained this Jerusalem-centric focus.  
* **Marcionite Witness:** BeDuhn and Roth affirm that Marcion’s text contained the instruction to "Remember what he spoke to you," though Marcion may have omitted the specific reference to "Galilee" or the "Son of Man" title depending on his specific text.17 However, the structure of "Remembering words" is Marcionite/Proto-Lukan.

### **3.6 The Peter Interpolation (Luke 24:12): The Verdict of the Evidence**

*Canonical Text:* **"But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened."**

* **Textual Evidence:** This entire verse is **omitted** by Codex Bezae (D) and the Old Latin manuscripts (a, b, d, e, l). It is the most famous **Western Non-Interpolation** in the chapter.14  
* **Source Critical Analysis:** The verse bears a suspicious resemblance to **John 20:3–10** (Peter running, stooping, seeing linen cloths).  
  * **Harmonization Hypothesis:** Most textual critics (including Westcott, Hort, and Ehrman) conclude that Luke 24:12 is a later scribal addition derived from John or a common oral tradition, inserted to harmonize Luke with John and to provide male verification for the women's testimony.21  
* **Marcionite Witness:** Since Marcion’s *Evangelion* predates the harmonization efforts of the late second century, **Luke 24:12 was almost certainly absent from Marcion.**  
  * **BeDuhn's Reconstruction:** BeDuhn explicitly excludes v. 12 from the Marcionite text, noting that Tertullian never references it even when it would have aided his argument against Marcion’s docetism (the physical linen cloths would prove a physical body had been there).9  
  * **Klinghardt’s View:** Klinghardt also marks this as an interpolation in the canonical text, absent from the *Oldest Gospel*.8  
* **Implication for Proto-Luke:** In Proto-Luke, the tomb narrative ends with the women reporting to the apostles and the apostles **disbelieving** them ("idle tale," v. 11). There is **no male verification**. The narrative moves directly from the women's rejected testimony to the Road to Emmaus. The tomb is left behind as an unsolved riddle, not a verified proof.

**4\. The Reconstructed Text of the Proto-Lukan Tomb Narrative**

Based on the intersection of the Western Text (D/Old Latin) and the Marcionite reconstructions (BeDuhn/Klinghardt), we can propose the following scientific reconstruction of the empty tomb narrative in Proto-Luke (c. 120–140 CE or earlier).

**Table 1: Comparison of Canonical Luke vs. Reconstructed Proto-Luke**

| Verse | Canonical Luke (NA28) | Proto-Luke / Marcion (Reconstructed) | Notes on Variation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **24:1** | Women go to tomb with spices. | **Present** | Core narrative. |
| **24:2** | Found stone rolled away. | **Present** | Core narrative. |
| **24:3** | Did not find the body **of the Lord Jesus**. | Did not find the body. | "of the Lord Jesus" omitted (Western Non-Interpolation). |
| **24:4** | Two men in dazzling apparel. | **Present** | Distinct Lukan feature (vs. Mark's one angel). |
| **24:5** | "Why do you seek the living among the dead?" | **Present** | Attested in Marcion (Tertullian/Epiphanius). |
| **24:6** | **"He is not here, but has been raised."** Remember how he told you... | **Absent.** "Remember how he told you..." | Resurrection proclamation omitted (Western Non-Interpolation). |
| **24:7** | Son of Man prophecy... | **Present** | Content of the memory. |
| **24:8** | They remembered his words. | **Present** | Key Lukan theme: Faith via word/memory. |
| **24:9** | Returned and told the eleven. | **Present** | Women as apostles to apostles. |
| **24:10** | (List of names: Mary Mag, Joanna...) | **Present** (or simplified) | Names present in core tradition. |
| **24:11** | Apostles considered it an idle tale. | **Present** | Disbelief is the final word on the tomb. |
| **24:12** | **Peter runs to tomb, sees linen cloths.** | **ABSENT** | **Interpolation.** Omitted by Western text/Marcion. |

### **Summary of Proto-Luke's Narrative Arc:**

In Proto-Luke, the women go to the tomb, find the body missing, are rebuked by angels for seeking the Living One in a cemetery, are told to remember his teaching, and report this to the men. The men dismiss it as nonsense. **The scene ends in failure and ambiguity.** There is no "Peter to the rescue," no verification of linen cloths. The "Empty Tomb" fails to generate faith. Faith only arises in the next scene (Emmaus) through the **spiritual encounter** with the stranger.

## ---

**5\. Theological Bias and the "Jamesian" Substrate**

The user query specifically asks to "watch out for theological bias." The history of this text is a history of theological manipulation. By peeling back the layers, we reveal a struggle between two competing christologies: the **Spiritual Resurrection** (Jamesian/Marcionite) and the **Physical Resuscitation** (Orthodox/Anti-Docetic).

### **5.1 The "Jamesian" Connection: Spiritual Exaltation**

The document \[1\] posits that Proto-Luke was a "Jamesian Protograph," originating from the Jerusalem church of James the Just. How does the empty tomb fit this?

* **The Problem:** The Jamesian community (Ebionites) and Paul (1 Cor 15\) emphasized a **Spiritual Resurrection** (*soma pneumatikon*). Paul never mentions an empty tomb. The finding of the Talpiot ossuaries (inscribed "Jesus son of Joseph") suggests the earliest family members knew where the bones were and did not view this as contradictory to his exaltation to God's right hand.25  
* **Proto-Luke’s Solution:** The Proto-Lukan narrative (as reconstructed above) is compatible with this view. The women find the *tomb* open and the *body* gone, but the angels ask, *"Why do you seek the living among the dead?"* This can be read not as "He has reanimated," but as "He is not in the realm of the dead; he is Exalted."  
* **Ambiguity:** By omitting "He is not here, but has been raised" (v. 6a), Proto-Luke leaves the mechanics of the disappearance ambiguous. It functions like the translation of Elijah (2 Kings 2\) or the Assumption of Moses—a removal of the body to signal exaltation, not necessarily a resuscitation of flesh to walk around on earth.

### **5.2 The "Orthodox" Interpolations: Creating Physical Proof**

The later additions to Luke (Canonical Luke) are clearly designed to "harden" the narrative against Gnostic/Marcionite readings that viewed Jesus as a spirit.

1. **Inserting Peter (v. 12):** The addition of Peter validates the tomb. It adds male authority and physical evidence ("linen cloths"). It counters the "women's idle tale" with apostolic verification.  
2. **Inserting "Flesh and Bones" (v. 39):** Later in the chapter, Canonical Luke has Jesus say, *"Touch me and see; for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."*  
   * **Marcion’s Text:** Tertullian reports that Marcion’s text read: *"A spirit does not have bones \[flesh is omitted\], as you see I have."* Or even more radically: *"as you see I have \[not\]."*.27  
   * **Ignatius:** Ignatius (Smyrnaeans 3.2) quotes a version: *"I am not a bodiless demon."*  
   * **Scientific Conclusion:** The "flesh and bones" and the "eating of fish" (Luke 24:41-43) are likely **Anti-Docetic interpolations** added to the Proto-Lukan core to force a physicalist interpretation that the original text did not demand.

### **5.3 Marcion as the Preserver**

The irony, often missed by theological bias, is that **Marcion**—the arch-heretic—likely preserved the more primitive, "Jamesian" form of the narrative. Marcion used the text because its "spiritual" Jesus (who appears and disappears, who is not bound by the tomb) fit his theology. The orthodox church, to fight Marcion, had to "materialize" the text, adding Peter’s inspection and the physical body proofs. Thus, the "Empty Tomb" narrative *was* in Marcion’s Bible (Proto-Luke), but it was an empty tomb that pointed away from matter, whereas the Canonical Luke turned it into a proof of matter.

## ---

**6\. Source Criticism: Was the Tomb Narrative Original to Proto-Luke?**

Finally, we address the origin of the narrative itself. Did Proto-Luke invent the empty tomb, or did it inherit it?

### **6.1 Dependence on Mark?**

The dominant scholarly view (2SH) is that Luke 24:1–11 is based on Mark 16:1–8. The verbal parallels (spices, stone, entry, fear) are strong.

* **Klinghardt’s Reversal:** Matthias Klinghardt argues that Mark used Marcion (\*Ev). If this is true, the *Evangelion* (Proto-Luke) is the **creator** of the empty tomb narrative. Mark then abbreviated it (removing the second angel/man and the memory of words).  
* **Standard View:** Even if Mark is prior, Proto-Luke shows significant independence (the "L" source). The "Two Men" and the "Remember" motif suggest Luke had a non-Markan passion source (as Taylor argued).

### **6.2 The L-Source Hypothesis**

The unique elements of Luke 24:1–12 (two men, "bowed faces," "remember Galilee," "idle tale") suggest that Proto-Luke was drawing on a distinct Jerusalem tradition (**L**).

* **Probability:** It is highly probable that the "L" source contained a resurrection account. However, Streeter and Taylor believed L might have lacked the empty tomb and focused only on appearances (Emmaus).  
* **Synthesis:** Proto-Luke likely **combined** the Markan empty tomb framework with the L-source appearance traditions (Emmaus). The resulting hybrid (Proto-Luke 24\) had the tomb, but stripped it of Mark's "Go to Galilee" command, replacing it with the L-source's Jerusalem focus.

## ---

**7\. Conclusions**

Based on an honest and rigorous scientific analysis of the textual, patristic, and source-critical evidence, we can conclude:

1. **High Probability of Presence:** The empty tomb narrative (Luke 24:1–11) was **present** in Proto-Luke (and Marcion’s *Evangelion*). It was not a later addition. The narrative structure of the Gospel requires the tomb to set up the confusion that is resolved on the road to Emmaus.  
2. **Textual Nature:** The Proto-Lukan tomb narrative was **shorter** and **theologically different** from the canonical version.  
   * It **lacked Luke 24:12** (Peter’s visit).  
   * It **lacked** the title "Lord Jesus" (v. 3).  
   * It **likely lacked** the explicit proclamation "He is not here, but has been raised" (v. 6a), focusing instead on the memory of Jesus' words.  
3. **Theological Function:** In Proto-Luke, the empty tomb was a sign of **absence**, not presence. It produced confusion ("perplexity"), not faith. Faith in Proto-Luke is generated solely by the **revelation of the Word** (opening the Scriptures) and the **Eucharist** (breaking of bread) in the Emmaus story, not by forensic evidence of a corpse's location.  
4. **Historical Reconstruction:** The canonical Gospel of Luke represents a later, "orthodox" redaction of this Proto-Lukan material. The redactor added Peter’s verification (v. 12\) and the physical proofs (v. 39-43) to counter the very interpretation Marcion held—that the resurrection was the liberation of the Spirit from the flesh.

**Final Verdict:** The empty tomb was in Proto-Luke, but it was a "spiritual" empty tomb—a mystery of absence—that was later concretized into a "physical" empty tomb—a proof of resuscitation—by the emerging orthodox church.
