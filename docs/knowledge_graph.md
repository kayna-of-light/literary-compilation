### Consciousness Studies
*NDEs, past-life research, CDE hypothesis, post-mortem existence*

#### [CONSC-001] Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) Hypothesis

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: medium

> Consciousness is a fundamental, active force in memetic (cultural) evolution, not merely an epiphenomenal byproduct of neural activity. The collective "ruling love" of a population creates selective pressures that push societies along one of two evolutionary trajectories: toward coherence/unity or fragmentation/conflict.

**Status**: validated | **Confidence**: high

> The love of self as the antagonist force in spiritual development. Manifests as self-glorification that perceives itself as good and seeks to suffocate all else.

**Status**: validated | **Confidence**: high

> A hermeneutic methodology that distinguishes the "natural plane" (body of effects) from the "spiritual plane" (soul of causes). Scientific/historical-critical findings provide accurate maps of external reality; Swedenborgian theology reveals meaning and causation. Neither tier negates the other; they operate on different planes.
