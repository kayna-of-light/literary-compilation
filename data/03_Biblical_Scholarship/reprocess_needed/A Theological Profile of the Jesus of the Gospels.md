# **A Theological Profile of the Jesus of the Gospels**

This document undertakes the construction of a detailed and honest theological profile of Jesus based exclusively on the character, mission, and teachings presented within the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The strategic importance of this approach lies in its focus on the foundational narratives themselves, seeking to understand the figure of Jesus as he is presented therein. This method intentionally sets aside later theological developments, particularly those of the Apostle Paul, to distill a portrait from the primary source texts of his life. The inquiry is not one of historical-critical deconstruction nor of devotional affirmation, but rather a phenomenological exegesis of the textual subject.

The core interpretive framework for this profile is that of the "Divine Human." This analysis will examine the Jesus of the Gospels as the ultimate manifestation of the Divine Human, whose life represents a "providentially guided history" intended to reveal the nature of divine love in its ultimate form. His actions, teachings, and ultimate fate are understood not as a series of disconnected events, but as a coherent and orchestrated revelation.

To build this comprehensive, textually-grounded portrait, this document will proceed systematically. It begins by examining the origins and inauguration of Jesus's mission as presented in the Gospels. It then moves to an analysis of his core activities—spiritual healing and the expulsion of demons—followed by an interpretation of his broader miracles as manifestations of divine order. From his divine actions, the focus will shift to his divine teachings, centered on love as the means of conjunction with God. Finally, the profile will culminate in an examination of the resurrection as the ultimate manifestation of his glorified, Divine Human nature.

## **Origins and Inauguration of the Mission**

To understand the Jesus of the Gospels, one must begin where the narratives themselves do: by establishing his identity and the divine authority for his mission. The geographical and spiritual origins of Jesus are not presented as incidental biographical details but as the essential foundation for his subsequent words and actions. The Gospels consistently place his upbringing in Nazareth of Galilee (Mark 1:9; Luke 2:4), situating him in a specific human community, while tracing his lineage to the royal house of David (Luke 2:4), providing the narrative context for his messianic role. This dual grounding—in the common life of Galilee and the sacred history of the Davidic monarchy—establishes the human vessel through which a divine purpose is to be revealed.

The pivotal moment that inaugurates his public mission is his baptism by John in the Jordan River (Mark 1:9-11). From a phenomenological perspective, this event represents a violent rupturing of ordinary reality. The text reports that Jesus saw the heavens being "torn open" (σχιζομένους, Mark 1:10), a disruptive image that signifies not a gentle unveiling but a phenomenological break allowing for a direct manifestation of the divine. Through this breach, the Spirit of God descends like a dove, and a voice from the heavens declares, "You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased." This is the definitive commissioning event, the narrative’s first clear portrayal of Jesus as the "Divine Human," a being in whom the divine and the human are uniquely conjoined. The voice from heaven serves as a direct, unmediated affirmation of his identity and authority, providing the spiritual mandate for the spiritual warfare he would immediately begin to wage.

## **The Core Mission: Spiritual Healing and the Expulsion of Demons**

The primary activity of Jesus, as depicted throughout the Gospels, is a direct spiritual battle against the forces of disorder that afflict humanity. His ministry of healing and exorcism should not be viewed merely as intermittent displays of power, but as the central and defining thrust of his mission. His purpose was the restoration of spiritual wholeness, from which all other forms of well-being would naturally flow. A consistent pattern in his ministry reveals that he prioritized the healing of the inner person. The account of the paralytic brought by his friends (Mark 2:1-12) serves as the paradigmatic example. Before addressing the man's physical ailment, Jesus prioritizes the supersensible malady over the physical symptom, declaring, **"Child, your sins are forgiven."** This statement, which provokes immediate controversy, demonstrates that for Jesus, the rectification of the internal spiritual state is the primary act of healing. The subsequent physical cure serves as an external confirmation of his authority to heal the soul.

This mission is most directly expressed in the act of driving out demons, which the Gospels portray as a direct confrontation with acute spiritual affliction. In accounts such as the dispossession of the man with an "unclean spirit" in the synagogue (Mark 1:23-27) or the dramatic healing of the Gerasene demoniac (Luke 8:27-36), Jesus is shown restoring the individual's mind and soul. These are not merely acts of power but acts of liberation, freeing individuals from the internal chaos that has overwhelmed their identity. Jesus himself provides the logic for this work when accused of using demonic power. He argues in parables: **"How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand"** (Mark 3:23-24). His power over demons is thus presented as proof of his authority over the kingdom of spiritual disorder. The core of his work was the direct application of divine love and truth to cure these spiritual maladies, a mission whose effects would then radiate outward into the natural world.

## **Miracles as Manifestations of Divine Order**

The broader miracles of Jesus, such as his control over nature and the multiplication of food, are presented in the Gospels as extensions of his core healing mission. They are not arbitrary suspensions of natural law but tangible demonstrations of the "Divine Influx"—the imposition of divine order, peace, and providence upon the chaotic and limited material world. The "nature miracles," most notably the calming of the storm on the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 8:23-27), function as large-scale enactments of his healing work. This demonstrates that the same chaotic principle afflicting the human mind as demonic influence is understood to be present in the disruptions of the natural world. When Jesus rebukes the wind and the waves, his power is shown to operate on a single, underlying reality of disorder, whether it manifests as a legion of demons or a tempest. The act is an imposition of divine peace over violent chaos, mirroring his work of calming the internal chaos of individuals.

Similarly, the miracles of provision, such as the feeding of the multitude (Mark 8:1-9), are physical manifestations of a spiritual reality. These events demonstrate that all life and sustenance flow from the Divine as their ultimate source, revealing the boundless nature of divine providence. As recorded by authors like Matthew for communities struggling after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 CE, these miracle accounts served a crucial theological purpose. During the painful "Parting of the Ways" from formative Rabbinic Judaism—a separation marked by developments like the *Birkat ha-Minim* and the eventual liturgical exclusion of the *ekklesia* from "their synagogues"—these narratives reinforced the belief that Jesus himself, not the lost Temple, was the true and enduring locus of God's presence and power on Earth. From these powerful divine *actions*, the profile now turns to the divine *teachings* that explain their meaning.

## **The Core Teaching: Love as the Conjunction with the Divine**

The central and unifying theme of all Jesus's teachings in the Gospels is the transformative power of love. This is not presented as mere human affection or ethical sentiment, but as the very essence of the Divine itself. To live from this love is to participate in the divine life, providing the sole path for spiritual regeneration and ultimate conjunction with God the Father. When asked to identify the greatest commandment, Jesus distills the entirety of the law and the prophets into two principles: love for God and love for the neighbor, concluding with the ultimate ethical demand: **"You shall love your neighbor as yourself"** (Mark 12:31). This reframes righteousness not as a matter of ritual observance, but as the active expression of love, which fulfills all divine commands.

According to the message of Jesus, all that is good and true originates from "the Lord," or God. Therefore, to act from genuine love is to act from the divine source that flows into creation. Parables like the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) demonstrate that true neighborly love transcends social and religious boundaries, directly reflecting the indiscriminate nature of divine compassion. Teachings from the Sermon on the Mount, such as the command to **"Love your enemies"** (Matthew 5:44), push this principle to its radical conclusion. Such an act is only possible by drawing upon a source of love beyond the self-interested human heart. Acting from this divine love is what leads to spiritual renewal, or "regeneration." This path of active, selfless love is thus presented in the Gospels as the sole means by which humanity can find its way to the Father, a journey of spiritual transformation that culminates in the final revelation of Jesus's own nature after his death.

## **The Resurrection: The Manifestation of the Glorified Divine Human**

The resurrection accounts in the Gospels, with their varied details, present a unique interpretive challenge. A phenomenological approach seeks not to harmonize every logistical detail, but to identify the consistent theological and experiential truth presented within them. Interpreted through the lens of the Divine Human, the resurrection is not a crude physical resuscitation but the ultimate demonstration of Jesus's glorified state—a complete manifestation of the Divine Human, perceptible now not to the physical senses, but to the renewed spiritual perception of his followers.

The narratives consistently emphasize the experiential and perceptual nature of the post-death encounters. Mary Magdalene at the tomb initially fails to recognize him, perceiving him only when he speaks her name, triggering a spiritual recognition (John 20:14-18). He appears to the disciples behind locked doors, a detail that points away from a purely physical mode of presence (John 20:19-23). Most tellingly, the disciples on the road to Emmaus walk and talk with him for hours, yet their recognition is not visual; it occurs in the ritual *action* of the "breaking of the bread," a moment that triggers an internal, affective state: their "hearts burned within them" (Luke 24:13-35). This represents a shift from mundane perception to a participatory, sacramental recognition. The phenomenon described is not the seeing of a person, but the *experience of presence through a ritual act*.

These accounts consistently describe what can be understood as non-physical manifestations. The appearances are portrayed as encounters with Jesus's glorified spiritual form. This interpretation unifies the accounts by shifting the focus from objective physical details to the subjective spiritual experience of the witnesses. The phenomenological structure of these encounters—a being of radiant presence, communication that transcends the physical, and recognition that is spiritual rather than purely visual—resonates with modern phenomenological studies of transcendent experiences. The resurrection, as portrayed in the Gospels, is therefore the final confirmation of Jesus's nature as the Divine Human: a being of pure love and truth, no longer limited by material constraints, whose glorified presence could now be experienced directly by all those who loved him.

## **Conclusion: The Coherent Profile of the Gospel Jesus**

By examining the canonical Gospels as a coherent narrative, a distinct and powerful theological profile of Jesus emerges. This profile, interpreted through the framework of the Divine Human, presents a figure whose life, mission, and teachings are unified by a singular, overarching purpose: the spiritual restoration of humanity.

The Jesus of the Gospels is the embodiment of the "Divine Human," whose mission was a direct confrontation with the spiritual disorders afflicting mankind. His healings and exorcisms were the primary expressions of this mission, applying divine love and truth to restore the inner person. His miracles over nature extended this principle, demonstrating the power of divine order over material chaos. His teachings provided the ethical and spiritual roadmap for this restoration, identifying selfless love—love for God and the neighbor—as the sole means of conjunction with the Divine. Finally, his resurrection stands as the ultimate manifestation of his glorified spiritual nature, a confirmation that the Divine Human transcends physical death and remains a living, perceptible presence to those with the spiritual sight to see.

This intrinsic profile, derived solely from the fabric of the Gospel narratives, offers a complete and compelling portrait of Jesus. It is a portrait that stands in clear distinction to other theological systems and interpretations found elsewhere within the New Testament, grounded in the foundational texts that first declared his identity and purpose to the world.
