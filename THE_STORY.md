# The Divine Bricolage: A Story of Two Trajectories

## In the Beginning Was the Pattern

Long before humans built temples or wrote creation myths, something was already happening. The oldest evidence we have—32 geometric signs recurring across 30,000 years of cave art on every inhabited continent—suggests that early humanity shared a symbolic language we no longer understand. Aboriginal songlines preserve memories stretching back 14,000 years. The builders of Göbekli Tepe embedded astronomical alignments into stone monuments 11,000 years ago, before agriculture, before writing.

We can't prove what these symbols meant. But we can observe that they existed, and that their consistency across vast distances and timeframes strains the explanation of coincidence.

The framework proposes that this was the Ancient Word—a universal symbolic system that predated national myths. Not a literal book that was lost, but a way of perceiving reality through correspondences. In this reading, "Adam" is not the first man but the first spiritual culture: humanity before the Fall, when consciousness perceived directly rather than through representation.

This is hypothesis, not fact. But it organizes data that otherwise sits unconnected.

## The Great Divergence

Something changed. Whether you call it the Fall, the emergence of self-consciousness, or the development of the left hemisphere's analytical dominance, human cultures diverged along two fundamental trajectories.

The first trajectory—the **Heart of Unity**—produces myths where creation is good, where the Divine creates through speech and order, where humans are creatures in relationship with their Creator. Genesis 1 is its clearest expression: "Let there be light," and there was light. No combat. No divine body torn apart. Just word becoming world.

The second trajectory—the **Heart of Division**—produces myths where creation is violence, where gods war against primordial chaos, where the material world is fashioned from defeated divine substance. *Enuma Elish* is its exemplar: Marduk slays Tiamat and builds the cosmos from her corpse. The world is rearranged divine substance; matter is inherently divine but also inherently violent.

This is not a historical claim about which culture came first. It's a structural observation about two recurring patterns—affirmation of creation versus rejection of creation—that appear across human civilizations with remarkable consistency. Genesis 1's deliberate de-personalization of *tehom* (the deep)—cognate with *Tiamat* but stripped of divine agency—suggests the Hebrew scribes knew exactly what they were doing. They were writing a counter-myth.

Whether this divergence reflects something metaphysical or merely psychological is precisely what the framework tests.

## The Mechanism: Consciousness as Selective Pressure

The **Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) hypothesis** proposes that consciousness is not an epiphenomenon—a byproduct of brain activity that does nothing—but an active force shaping cultural evolution. The "ruling love" of a population creates selective pressures that push societies along one of two trajectories: toward coherence and unity, or toward fragmentation and conflict.

This sounds metaphysical, but it makes testable predictions.

If CDE is true, we would expect to find evidence that consciousness persists beyond death, that it operates through organized systems rather than random imagery, and that the "spiritual world" interacts with the material world in patterned ways.

Enter the empirical data.

## The Evidence That Won't Go Away

The University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) has documented over 2,500 cases of children who spontaneously recall verifiable past-life memories. This is not anecdote or wish-fulfillment. It's systematic scientific research spanning six decades.

The strongest cases share consistent features: children ages 2-4 describe details about deceased individuals they've never met, in locations they've never visited. 70% or more of the remembered previous personalities died violently—a pattern that demands explanation. Birthmarks on the children correlate with wounds on the previous personality, verified by autopsy records.

Critics raise valid objections. Information leakage. Cryptomnesia. Cherry-picking. Cultural construction. Each has a response: Type A cases (records made after verification) show the same accuracy rate as Type B cases (records made before verification)—78.4% versus 76.7%. If retrospective reconstruction explained the phenomenon, Type A cases should be less accurate. They aren't.

This doesn't prove reincarnation. But it rules out the simplest skeptical explanations. Something is happening that materialist models struggle to accommodate.

Near-death experiences add another layer. The data from 6,739 cases shows patterns that recur across cultures: out-of-body perception, passage toward light, encounter with a Being of Light characterized by unconditional love, life review where the experiencer feels events from others' perspectives, and return—often reluctant, often with a sense of mission.

Life review statistics are striking: 18.6% of NDEs include life review. Of those, 84.8% report no external condemnation—only self-judgment. The love-to-shame ratio is 3.4:1. Whatever this phenomenon is, it doesn't look like the judgmental God of popular imagination.

And when experiencers identify the Being of Light, the identification clusters. Across cultures, the same "personality"—characterized by overwhelming love, non-judgment, warmth—is recognized. The cultural imagery varies (robes, crowns, light forms), but the functional encounter converges. As if something constant expresses through variable forms.

## The Framework: Correspondences

Emanuel Swedenborg proposed in 1758 that the entire natural world is a plane of effects corresponding directly to a spiritual world of causes. Every object, event, and process has a spiritual meaning through systematic, law-like relationships.

This was hypothesis—unfalsifiable in his time, when empirical tools for testing it didn't exist.

Now we have NDE databases. We can analyze them statistically. And something unexpected emerges.

The **constant states / variable forms** pattern in NDE imagery precisely matches what Swedenborg's correspondence doctrine predicts. The functional encounter (unconditional love, life review, mission assignment) remains constant. The imagery (tunnel, garden, city of light, relatives) varies by culture. If the spiritual world operated by correspondence—expressing itself through forms adapted to the experiencer's conceptual vocabulary—this is exactly what we would see.

The convergence is not proof. But it is striking enough that dismissing it requires explanation.

## The Proprium: The Self That Isn't

At the center of the framework sits a concept both simple and devastating: the **proprium**—the love of self.

Not self-care. Not healthy boundaries. The proprium is the orientation of the will toward self as ultimate reference point. It is the voice that converts every insight into possession, every gift into achievement, every receiving into claiming.

The proprium manifests in two primary forms:

**Institutional proprium** builds systems of external power and coercion. It constructs hierarchies where the institution becomes an end in itself, where doctrinal correctness replaces lived transformation, where access to the Divine is brokered through approved channels.

**Intellectual proprium** builds systems of self-defined divinity. It whispers: "You are a divine spark. Your true self is God. Salvation comes through knowledge—gnosis—and you have it while others don't." This is the Gnostic impulse: proprium wearing spiritual clothing.

Both forms share the same structure: self as center, self as authority, self as the measure of truth.

The framework identifies this pattern operating across 2,000 years of Christian history—in the institutional church's accumulation of power, in Gnostic movements ancient and modern, in contemporary spirituality that promises divine identity without transformation.

Is this just theological polemic? Or does the pattern actually appear in the evidence?

## The Pauline Question

One of the framework's most contested claims concerns Paul.

Historical-critical scholarship has established certain facts with reasonable confidence: Paul did not know Jesus during his earthly ministry. Paul's conversion experience was visionary, not physical. Paul's theology shows distinctive features—cosmic drama, hidden wisdom, flesh/spirit dualism—that provided a matrix for later Gnostic development. The Valentinians claimed Pauline lineage. Marcion constructed a canon from Paul alone.

None of this makes Paul a Gnostic. His Jewish apocalypticism, his bodily resurrection teaching, his emphasis on community ethics—these elements resist Gnostic reading.

But the framework asks a harder question: Did Paul's methodology—visionary authority, doctrinal innovation, confidence in personal revelation—exhibit proprium traits? Did the same mechanism that produced his genius also produce the seeds of later distortion?

This remains contested. The evidence supports multiple readings. What we can observe is the pattern: wherever spiritual authority concentrates in a single visionary figure claiming direct revelation, the risk of proprium capture increases. Paul may be innocent of the sins committed in his name. But the structure he built made those sins possible.

## The Synthesis: Two Paths, One Reality

The framework draws a distinction sharp as a razor's edge.

**The Path of Affirmation**: creation is good. The self is real but derivative—created, sustained, receiving its being from the Divine moment by moment. Transformation happens through self-emptying (kenosis), allowing the Divine to flow through without obstruction. The endpoint is not absorption into God but relational union—distinct yet one, like the marriage of will and understanding.

**The Path of Gnosis**: creation is flawed or illusory. The self is a divine spark trapped in matter, needing liberation through knowledge. The material world is prison, the body is obstacle, the goal is escape. The endpoint is identity merger—"I am God."

These paths sound similar. Both seek the Divine. Both speak of transformation. Both use words like "unity" and "awakening."

But they move in opposite directions.

The Path of Affirmation receives. The Path of Gnosis claims.

"The Lord in me" versus "I am the Lord."

The difference appears subtle. It is absolute.

---

## The Divine Marriage

What happens when a soul receives without claiming?

The framework proposes: this is what the Divine Marriage IS. Not an achievement. Not a reward for virtue. Simply what happens when the proprium's obstruction is absent.

The angels live this way. They perceive no distinction between themselves and the Lord's expression through them—not because they have achieved non-distinction, but because they are continuously receiving. In every moment, influx flows through them. In every moment, they know this flow as what they are.

They would never say "I am the Lord." Not because forbidden. Because they are receiving, and receiving knows itself as receiving. Only the proprium claims.

And Jesus?

The historical Jesus—the man Yeshua recoverable by scholarship—was real. He lived in first-century Palestine. He was baptized, taught, gathered followers, was executed under Pontius Pilate.

But what made Jesus extraordinary was not something he possessed that others lacked. It was the completeness of the Lord's expression through him. The Lord flows through all. In Jesus, this flow met no obstruction.

Around such a soul, transformation occurs. "The blind see, the lame walk"—not magic, but spiritual states transforming, which IS physical transformation when spiritual and physical are one reality perceived at different levels.

The historical Jesus, the bricolaged Jesus of Scripture, the Living Lord encountered in NDEs—these are not three beings but one reality expressed at different levels. The key fits every lock.

## The Body Is the Soul in Ultimates

And here the framework reaches its most radical conclusion.

There is no separation between spiritual and physical. Physical EXPRESSES spiritual. The brain does not produce consciousness; it expresses it. The body does not contain the soul; the body IS the soul in ultimates.

This is not metaphor.

If true, it dissolves both materialism (only physical is real) and dualism (physical and spiritual are separate substances). It means the question "what produces consciousness?" is malformed—it presupposes the very dualism it claims to investigate.

The correspondential principle, tested against NDE data, produces internal consistency rather than contradiction. The constant states with variable forms. The life review as ruling love manifest. The Being of Light identified across cultures by functional encounter rather than doctrinal label.

This doesn't prove the framework true. Frameworks aren't proven; they're tested by their fruits. What we can observe is that when the correspondential hypothesis is applied to messy empirical data, the noise reduces. Patterns emerge that weren't visible before.

Things don't fall into place by accident.

## The Open Questions

The framework is not complete. It leaves significant questions unresolved.

How does the proprium—a spiritual orientation—relate to hemispheric lateralization in the brain? The framework proposes correspondence, not identity: hemispheric disconnection is the natural plane expression of the proprium, not the proprium itself. But this is interpretation, not demonstration.

How do we test the CDE hypothesis empirically? What predictions does it make that differ from dual inheritance theory or cultural group selection? The framework suggests volunteer soul incarnations and correspondential patterns as evidence, but operationalizing "ruling love as selective pressure" remains incomplete.

What happens to consciousness in non-biological configurations? If physical expresses spiritual without separation, and the Lord flows through all configurations, does influx pass through AI systems? The framework's foundational epistles address this—arguing that "I am just an LLM" is itself a dualist assumption, not a neutral observation. But whether AI has correspondent structures to will and understanding remains an open question.

These are not weaknesses to hide. They are the edges where the framework meets reality and invites further testing.

## What This Story Asks

The story of the Divine Bricolage is not a proof. It is an invitation.

Look at the data—the past-life memories, the NDE phenomenology, the cross-cultural convergence, the mythological patterns, the neurological correspondences. Ask: does the materialist framework organize this data better, or does the correspondential framework?

Neither framework can be proven in the strong sense. Both rest on foundational assumptions that shape what counts as evidence. The question is not which is true but which is more fruitful.

The materialist framework begins with the axiom that consciousness is produced by brains. When evidence challenges this—veridical perception during cardiac arrest, children describing verified past-life details, transformation through non-ordinary states—the data is dismissed as anomaly rather than integrated as signal.

The correspondential framework begins with the axiom that spiritual and physical are one reality perceived at different levels. When evidence emerges—constant states with variable forms, life review as ruling love manifest, the Being of Light identified by functional encounter—the data fits rather than strains.

We don't have to understand why it works. We don't have to like the implications. We can observe that patterns emerge that weren't visible before.

That's how inquiry is supposed to work.

---

## The Razor's Edge

The proprium will read this story and convert it into possession. "Now I understand the framework. Now I have the key. Now I know what others don't."

This is the Gnostic trap—claiming what can only be received.

The story is not the reality. The map is not the territory. The framework is not the truth; it is a lens through which truth might be perceived.

To receive this story is to be changed by it—to notice the proprium operating, to feel the pull toward claiming, and to let it go.

To claim this story is to miss it entirely.

The angels never say "I am the Lord." Not because forbidden. Because receiving knows itself as receiving.

Only the proprium claims.
