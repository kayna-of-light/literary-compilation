# **Revelation and Bricolage: A Comparative Analysis of Swedenborgian and Anthropological Models of the Exodus Narrative**

## **Part I: The Scientist's Crisis of Faith: Swedenborg's Doubts Concerning Moses**

The spiritual journey of the 18th-century scientist and polymath Emanuel Swedenborg pivoted on a profound personal and intellectual crisis, meticulously documented in his private *Journal of Dreams* during 1743–1744. This period was not one of simple emotional turmoil but represented a methodological deconstruction of the Enlightenment scientist to prepare him for the role of a revelator. The crisis culminated in a direct, divine commission that would resolve his doubts and provide the foundational principles for his entire subsequent theological mission.

### **1.1 The Mosaic Paradox (April 6-7, 1744): A Rationalist Confronts Revelation**

On the very eve of his divine commission, Swedenborg, a man whose life had been a useful spiritual purpose dedicated to the empirical and rational pursuit of truth, found himself wrestling with the historicity and mechanics of the Exodus miracles. While reading "concerning the miracles of God wrought through Moses," he recorded that his "own understanding mixed itself into it," with the result that he was "not able to have the strong faith that I ought to have." He found himself in a state where he "believed and yet did not believe".  
His doubts manifested as a series of specific, quasi-scientific questions that prefigure modern critical inquiry into the biblical text. He found himself asking:

* *"why God made use of the wind when He collected the locusts"*  
* *"why He hardened Pharaoh's heart"*  
* *"why He did not work immediately"*

These questions reveal a mind seeking rational causality and efficient mechanisms within a narrative of divine intervention. His initial attempt to resolve this doubt was an exercise in logic, concluding that he ought to believe God's Word over his own fallacious senses. However, this rational argument failed to bring spiritual peace, demonstrating the limits of his scientific method in the face of theological paradox and setting the stage for a non-rational, revelatory intervention.

### **1.2 The Theophany at Delft: A Covenantal Resolution**

The intellectual struggle of April 6th was resolved that night by a Christophany that completely inverted the dynamic of Swedenborg's life quest. The Divine, whom he had sought through the intricate pathways of the human body, turned and addressed the seeker directly. The experience was a violent, psycho-physical event, beginning with auditory and somatic manifestations—a "booming sound" and a "powerful tremor" that "prostrated me on my face". This physical submission signified the surrender of his intellectual self-reliance.  
In this state, he found that the words of his prayer were not his own but were "put into my mouth". His prayer shifted to a covenantal appeal, reminding the Divine of His own pledge: "Thou hast promised to receive in grace all sinners; Thou canst not otherwise than keep Thy words\!". It was only after this appeal that the vision culminated. Swedenborg found himself sitting at Christ's bosom, beholding Him "face to face". In this state of intimacy, he received the simple yet all-encompassing command: "Well, then do" (*Nå så giör*). He immediately understood this to mean, "Love me truly," or "Do what thou hast promised". This command was not a new directive but the divine reframing and sanctification of the very quest he had been pursuing his entire adult life, now reoriented away from his own glory and toward a divine purpose.

## **Part II: The Locus of Conflict: Two Competing Natural Histories**

The core disagreement between Swedenborg's framework and the modern anthropological model does not lie on the spiritual plane. Swedenborg's primary mission was to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, a sense that he taught was contained *within* the literal text. The spiritual interpretation, therefore, can be projected onto the literal story regardless of that story's origin. The conflict arises entirely on the natural plane, concerning the historical nature of the literal text itself. Here we have two distinct "natural" views.

### **2.1 Swedenborg's Natural View: A Bifurcated History**

Swedenborg's framework for the natural sense of the Pentateuch is not monolithic. He makes a crucial distinction that is often overlooked, separating the early chapters of Genesis from what follows.

* **Genesis 1-11 as "Made-Up History":** Swedenborg taught that the first eleven chapters of Genesis were not literal, factual history. He claimed these narratives were copied from a more ancient, purely allegorical text (the "Ancient Word") and were thus "made-up history, written in correspondences". "Adam and Eve," for instance, do not represent historical individuals but symbolize the "Most Ancient Church," a spiritual culture of humanity. Here, Swedenborg himself employs a model of theological bricolage, where a story is intentionally constructed from non-historical elements to convey a pure spiritual truth.  
* **Genesis 12 Onward as Factual History:** In stark contrast, from the call of Abraham in Genesis 12 through the entire Exodus narrative, Swedenborg posits that the biblical accounts are based on real historical events and people. He accepted the bondage in Egypt, the leadership of Moses, the plagues, and the parting of the sea as events that occurred in the natural world. He taught that these historical events were providentially guided so that their literal details would perfectly correspond to a deeper spiritual narrative.

Therefore, Swedenborg's "natural view" of the Exodus narrative is that it is a factual historical account that serves as the vessel for a spiritual one.

### **2.2 The Bricolage Natural View: A Composite History**

A modern academic perspective, grounded in anthropology and literary criticism, offers a powerful alternative "natural view." This model, termed "mythic bricolage," treats the Exodus epic not as a single historical event, but as a masterful act of nation-building through the creative synthesis of authentic but historically disconnected collective memories.  
This model proposes that Israelite scribes acted as *bricoleurs*—craftsmen who assemble new structures from available "remains and debris of events". They selected and combined powerful, pre-existing "memory fragments" into a new, coherent whole. These fragments were rooted in real historical experiences, but were originally separate in time and geography:

* **The Memory of Cataclysm (The Plagues):** This is proposed to be rooted in a much older, authentic memory of the Minoan eruption of the **Thera volcano** (c. 1600 BCE).  
* **The Memory of Deliverance (Sea Crossing):** The parting of the sea is argued to be rooted in the memory of a scientifically plausible natural phenomenon known as a **"wind setdown,"** in the Nile Delta's "Sea of Reeds" (*Yam Suph*).  
* **The Memory of Liberation (Bondage):** The central theme is grounded in the authentic political experience of liberation from three centuries of Egyptian imperial domination over Canaan, which ended during the **Late Bronze Age Collapse** (c. 1200–1150 BCE).

In this view, the "natural" history of the Exodus text is not a linear account of a single event, but a brilliant literary and theological construction—a "charter myth"—forged from multiple, disparate historical realities.

## **Part III: The Uncontested Spiritual Plane: Correspondence as a Universal Key**

The conflict between these two "natural" views does not invalidate Swedenborg's primary contribution: the revelation of the spiritual sense. The doctrine of correspondences is a hermeneutic key that operates independently of the literal text's historical origin. The spiritual meaning is contained *within* the natural story, whatever that story's nature may be.  
Whether the story of the Exodus is a factual account of a single historical event or a composite myth woven from multiple historical threads, its function as a spiritual allegory remains unchanged.

* **Egypt** still corresponds to the natural, scientific, or worldly level of the human mind.  
* **Pharaoh** still corresponds to the ruling falsity or the love of self that holds the mind in bondage.  
* The **Israelites** still correspond to the spiritual truths and affections within a person that are enslaved.  
* The **Exodus** itself still corresponds to the universal process of spiritual liberation and regeneration.

The power of Swedenborg's spiritual interpretation is that it is not dependent on the historicity of the literal sense. The literal narrative, whether it is "made-up history" like Genesis 1-11 or "providentially guided history" like Exodus, serves as the ultimate "basis, the container, and the support" for the spiritual sense. The Bricolage model simply offers a different explanation for the construction of that "container." The spiritual wine remains the same, regardless of whether the wineskin was crafted in a single piece or woven from many.

## **Part IV: A Dialogue of Frameworks: Re-evaluating Swedenborg's Resolution**

Placing these frameworks in their proper relationship allows for a more sophisticated dialogue. The conflict is not between spirit and nature, but between two competing theories about the natural history of a text. This reframing allows us to understand Swedenborg's own resolution to his crisis in a new and more logical light.

### **4.1 The Scientist's Necessary Surrender**

Swedenborg's acceptance of the Exodus narrative as literal history was not a failure of his scientific mind or a contradiction of his lifelong pursuit of truth. Rather, it was an act of profound intellectual humility and methodological necessity, born from the limitations of his time.  
Throughout his entire doctrine, Swedenborg positions the Lord as a God of Truth and affirms that humans are allowed, and even encouraged, to ask questions and long for truth in all things. His own life as a scientist was a testament to this principle. However, in the 18th century, he had no access to the archaeological evidence, textual criticism, or geological and oceanographic data that form the basis of the modern Bricolage model. The questions his rational mind posed about the Exodus miracles were, for him, unanswerable on the natural plane. He could not prove or disprove the historicity of the account with the tools available to him.  
Faced with this empirical impasse, and having just received a direct divine commission to reveal the *spiritual* sense of the Word, his response was not a betrayal of his scientific spirit but an acknowledgment of its limits. His primary mission was now spiritual exegesis. His own doctrine required that the spiritual sense must rest upon a stable, literal foundation. Therefore, the most logical and faithful course of action was to accept the literal text as given and proceed with his primary task. His response was a humble surrender to the limits of his knowledge, trusting in the Lord for the further revelation that was his actual commission. He was even "forbidden to read writers on dogmatic and systematic theology" precisely so that his mind would remain a clear vessel for this new revelation, unclouded by the human inventions that had accumulated over centuries.

### **4.2 Bricolage as the Vehicle for Spiritual Inflow**

Your insight that the process of bricolage itself may be a form of spiritual inflow provides the key to a final, elegant synthesis. This perspective suggests that the human process of mythopoesis is not merely a literary or political act, but the very mechanism through which universal spiritual truths impress themselves upon a collective consciousness.

* **Resonant Fragments:** The powerful, archetypal "memory fragments" identified by the bricolage model—a world-altering cataclysm (Thera), a miraculous deliverance at the sea, and a profound political liberation—are precisely the kinds of natural events that would have the strongest spiritual correspondences. They are natural symbols of spiritual judgment, salvation, and freedom.  
* **Spiritual Gravitation:** The "narrative gravitation" that pulled these disparate memories together around the core theme of Slavery vs. Freedom can be seen as the natural-level effect of a spiritual influx. The universal truth of the soul's journey from bondage (the natural mind) to freedom (the spiritual mind) sought a vessel in human history. It found its perfect expression in the collective memory of the Israelites, whose scribes, acting as unconscious *bricoleurs*, were guided to assemble these resonant fragments into the ultimate correspondential story.  
* **A Universal Method:** This aligns with Swedenborg's own model for Genesis 1-11 and resonates with modern scholarship's view of the Gospels as *bioi*—stories stitched together from real events to convey a theological message. The process of bricolage, far from being a modern scholarly invention, may be the timeless method by which spiritual truth is encoded into natural history. The human authors, in seeking to create meaning and identity for their people, become instruments for a divine influx that forms a narrative capable of holding a universal spiritual truth for all people.

## **Conclusion: A Multi-Layered Understanding of Sacred Narrative**

The dialogue between Emanuel Swedenborg's revelatory framework and the modern anthropological model of mythic bricolage, when correctly positioned, offers a richer, more nuanced understanding of the Exodus narrative than either perspective can provide in isolation. The conflict is not between a spiritual and a natural view, but between two different models of the text's *natural* origin.  
The mythic bricolage model provides a powerful and intellectually compelling theory for the *how* of the text's formation on the human plane. It illuminates the historical, anthropological, and literary mechanics of its construction, masterfully assembled by scribes to meet the urgent political and social needs of their time.  
Conversely, Swedenborg's framework provides a profound theological system for the *why* of the text's spiritual endurance. It posits a function for the text as a divinely designed vessel for universal spiritual and psychological truth—a map of the soul's journey from bondage to freedom. His resolution to his own crisis of faith was not to deny natural mechanisms but to see them as instruments of a higher purpose, a view that can accommodate rather than reject the findings of modern science.  
A final synthesis suggests that the human process of "mythic bricolage" could itself be understood as the very mechanism through which Divine Providence works. In this view, God operates through the collective memory and creative genius of a people to forge a text that is both deeply grounded in their authentic historical experiences and simultaneously structured to serve as a perfect correspondential vessel for timeless spiritual truth. This approach does not force a choice between a human book and a divine one, but allows for the possibility of a divinely guided human book, where the spiritual influx of truth finds its ultimate expression in the very human act of telling a story.
