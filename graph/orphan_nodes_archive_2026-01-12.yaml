    definition: 'Two mutually exclusive soteriological trajectories: (1) The Path
      of Affirmation (Path of Love) - characterized by experiential encounter with
      the "Being of Light" spontaneously identified as the Divine Human Jesus Christ;
      defined by reception of truth FROM the Lord, unconditional love, non-judgment;
      (2) The Path of Gnosis (Path of Dismantling) - characterized by cognitive approaches
      that dismantle the Divine Human correspondence through "splitting the identity"
      (separating human Jesus from impersonal Christ principle) or "changing the name"
      (Sananda, Jmmanuel). These paths "like clay and iron, do not mingle." NDE data

    definition: 'The hypothesis that the brain functions as a filter, receiver, or
      reducing valve for consciousness rather than its generator (Production Theory).
      Originally proposed by William James and Henri Bergson, this model attempts
      to explain paradoxes like terminal lucidity and NDE hyper-lucidity. However,
      filter theory PRESERVES Cartesian dualism by maintaining two separate substances—consciousness
      (transmitted) and brain (transmitter). This framework rejects filter theory
      in favor of correspondence ontology: the brain does not filter consciousness;
      the brain IS consciousness expressed in ultimates. Physical substance is not
      separate from spiritual substance—it is direct expression.

      \ theory is incompatible with the framework. It is a common post-materialist\
      \ position (James, Bergson, Kelly et al.), and researchers often cite it. But\
      \ it preserves the dualism it claims to transcend. Correspondence ontology is\
      \ the alternative: not two substances with a filtering relationship, but one\
      \ reality at different degrees. The phenomena filter theory tries to explain\
      \ (terminal lucidity, NDE hyper-consciousness) are better explained by correspondence—consciousness\
      \ was never dependent on brain production, so brain failure doesn't \"release\"\
      \ it.\n\nCorrespondence Explanation:These phenomena don't require a filter being\
      \ lifted. They demonstrate that consciousness is NOT PRODUCED by brain. Brain\
      \ degradation doesn't \"release\" consciousness—it reveals that consciousness\
      \ was never dependent on brain function. The soul is accumulating experience\
      \ through the body; when body fails, the soul continues. Not filter removal,\

      \ it solves the mind-body problem for materialism without fully abandoning materialism.\
      \ It allows consciousness to be primary while preserving the assumption that\
      \ brain and consciousness are separate things. But this is exactly the dualism\
      \ that correspondence ontology dissolves: there are not two substances. Physical\

      Specifically: (1) NDE imagery varies culturally, but functional outcomes converge—variable

      (70%+)— organized by Restorative Incarnation; (3) Return reasons discriminate
      mission from non-mission with 94.6% accuracy; (4) HCM findings organize naturally
      under correspondence interpretation. This is not confirmation bias but hypothesis

      \nSTRONG EVIDENCE (independently valid scholarship):\n1. Philological: \"Magdalene\"\
      \ = \"The Tower\" (migdal), parallel to \"Peter the Rock\"\n   - Jerome preserved\
      \ this: \"called the tower from the earnestness of faith\"\n   - Micah 4:8 \"\
      Tower of the Flock\" as messianic prophecy location\n2. Literary: Gnostic texts\
      \ (Gospel of Mary, Philip, Thomas, Acts of Philip)\n   - Gospel of Philip: koinonos\
      \ (companion/partner), \"loved her more than others\"\n   - Gospel of Mary:\
      \ possesses gnosis superior to male apostles\n   - Acts of Philip: Mariamne\
      \ baptized women, wore men's clothes (apostolic authority)\n3. Socio-economic:\
      \ hyparchonton (Luke 8:3) = legally controlled property/assets\n   - High-status\
      \ patron like Joanna (wife of Herod's steward)\n4. \"Martha\" as title, not\
      \ person: Mārthā = emphatic feminine of Mar (Master)\n   - \"Mariamene e Mara\"\
      \ = single person with title, not two people\n   - Luke's \"narrative fission\"\
      \ split one figure into Mary (spiritual) and Martha (domestic)\n\nTALPIOT EVIDENCE\
      \ (contested but statistically significant):\n- Feuerverger's ORIGINAL analysis:\
      \ 600:1 to 1,000,000:1 odds against random cluster\n- Including James Ossuary\
      \ (geochemically linked): > 99.9% confidence\n- DNA: Non-maternal relation between\
      \ Yeshua and Mariamene ossuaries\n- Unique Greek inscription in otherwise Aramaic\
      \ tomb = special status\n\nTHEOLOGICAL BIAS PATTERN DETECTED:\n- Bovon stated\
      \ Mariamne is \"a possible Greek equivalent\" for Miriam (SUPPORTIVE)\n- Bovon\
      \ later \"clarified\" position AFTER intense media/academic backlash\n- Feuerverger's\
      \ \"rejoinder\" came after removing Bovon assumption under pressure\n- Multiple\
      \ scholars interviewed, then issued \"corrections\" saying they were misquoted\n\
      - Princeton 2008: Jacobovici/Cameron accused organizers of misrepresenting conclusions\n\
      - This follows the project's identified pattern: scholars present evidence honestly,\n\
      \  then \"turn around\" when implications touch theological third rails (Jesus\
      \ married)\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL NOTE: The scholarly \"consensus\" against Talpiot\
      \ may itself be\nevidence of theological filtering. When statisticians say the\
      \ data is significant\nthen retract only after textual scholars back away from\
      \ their own analysis,\nthis is the bias pattern the project is designed to detect\
      \ and document.\n\nExtraction notes:Re-verified 2025-01-04 after critical analysis\
      \ with theological bias detection:\n\nTEXTUAL/LITERARY EVIDENCE (HIGH CONFIDENCE):\n\
      - Gospel of Mary, Gospel of Philip: authenticated 2nd-3rd century sources\n\
      - Acts of Philip: Bovon's scholarly work IS peer-reviewed and valid\n- Bovon\
      \ DID identify Mariamne with apostolic authority traditions\n- His later \"\
      distancing\" from documentary ≠ invalidation of textual analysis\n\nSTATISTICAL\
      \ EVIDENCE (MODERATE-HIGH):\n- Feuerverger's original Bayesian analysis published\
      \ in Annals of Applied Statistics\n- This IS peer-reviewed mathematical analysis\n\
      - The \"collapse\" came from removing an assumption that was RETRACTED under\
      \ pressure\n- Original assumption (Mariamne=Greek equivalent) remains textually\
      \ valid per Bovon\n\nDNA EVIDENCE (STRONG):\n- Non-maternal relationship between\
      \ ossuaries = fact\n- \"Spousal\" interpretation is the logical inference in\
      \ family tomb context\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL REVISION:\nPrevious agent assessment\
      \ accepted scholarly \"consensus\" uncritically. Upon review\nwith theological\
      \ bias lens, the consensus appears to follow the pattern described\nin the project's\
      \ copilot-instructions: honest presentation of evidence followed\nby institutional/theological\
      \ pressure leading to retraction of implications.\n\nStatus \"contested\" remains\
      \ accurate - but contested by theological concern, not\nrefutation of the underlying\
      \ evidence.\n\nCaveats:\n- Talpiot identification contested but rejection may\
      \ reflect theological bias more than evidence\n- Scholarly \"consensus\" formed\
      \ under pattern of retraction-after-implications-recognized\n- Bovon's support\
      \ for textual connection remains valid despite later \"clarifications\"\n- Feuerverger\
      \ statistics remain mathematically valid; \"collapse\" was removal of valid\
      \ assumption\n\nEvidence:\n- 'Magdalene' = 'The Tower' (migdal), parallel to\
      \ 'Peter the Rock'\n- Luke/Martha narrative = 'fission' of single figure into\

    definition: 'The fundamental operation of the Proprium: appropriating divine attributes
      (life, wisdom, power) and claiming them as intrinsic properties of the self
      rather than gifts received via influx. Swedenborg describes evil spirits who
      "insist stubbornly that they do live from themselves," refusing to acknowledge
      continuous influx from the Lord. The Proprium collapses the "As-of-Self" paradox
      (living AS IF life were one''s own while acknowledging it is NOT) into an absolute
      claim: "As-if" becomes "Is." The Gnostic "Divine Spark" doctrine legitimizes
      this theft by defining the soul as consubstantial with the Divine, possessing
      life rather than receiving it.

    definition: 'Two fundamentally incompatible modes of knowing and relating to Divine
      reality. INFLUX: Man is a VESSEL receiving life/truth from external Source (the

      reception. These are "clay and iron" (Daniel 2)—they cannot mix. One cannot
      simultaneously believe "I am a created vessel dependent on the Lord" and "I
      am the uncreated Divine Spark." Proprium gravitates toward Gnosis (validates

      but incompatible modes of knowing. Influx = receptive; Gnosis = possessive.
      Proprium prefers Gnosis because it validates autonomy without requiring submission
      to external Lord.


      Caveats:

      - This is theological framework analysis, not neutral description

      - Many spiritual seekers blend elements without recognizing incompatibility

      - Framework identifies structural logic, not conscious intention


      Gnosis Epistemology:

      autonomy: Self as ultimate Source of truth

      foundation: Man IS life or possesses divine fragment

      mechanism: Self-realization of inherent divinity

      requirement: ''Recognition of forgotten identity: ''''I am God; I had just forgotten''''''

      salvation: Awakening to true nature, not reception from Other


      Influx Epistemology:

      foundation: Man as VESSEL of life, not life itself

      humility: Submission to Lord as ultimate Source

      mechanism: Continuous reception from external Divine Source

      requirement: ''Acknowledgment of dependence: ''''I am not God; I receive God''''''

      spiritual_health: Depends on continuous acknowledgment of this reception


      Irreconcilable Conflict:

      metaphor: "''Clay and iron'' (Daniel 2)\u2014cannot mix"

      proprium_preference: Gravitates toward Gnosis (validates autonomy)

      proprium_rejection: Rejects Influx (requires submission to Other)

      simultaneous_holding: Logically impossible to hold both positions


      Modern Manifestations:

      closed_loop: If ''I am God,'' my desires/impulses/truths are divine

      new_age: Higher Self as divine guide; channeling inner wisdom

      sbnr: Trust your own intuitions; you are your own guru

      self_spirituality: Inner experience as final arbiter, rejecting external authority


      Validation Dynamics:

      gnosis_appeal: Sacralizes Proprium; removes judgment

      gnosis_loop: Self validates Self; no external standard

      influx_challenge: Requires humility; Proprium finds intolerable

      influx_loop: Lord validates truth through Scripture/Church/Conscience'

      PATH OF EMPTYING (Buddhism, certain Gnostic streams): Recognizes perverted influx
      causes suffering; solution is emptying of ALL influx/attachment to end suffering
      through cessation (nirvana). If nothing flows in, if we cease to exist as receiving
      beings, we become free. Detachment from everything. Addresses problem by ending
      reception itself. PATH OF RESTORATION (Lord-centered): Recognizes perverted
      influx causes suffering; solution is receiving DIRECT influx from Lord to HEAL
      what''s twisted. Wholeness through proper reception, not cessation. Perverted
      spiritual states = truth twisted by proprium, only restorable by Lord''s influx.
      When Lord flows unobstructed → spiritual causes heal → natural effects transform.
      Not removal but restoration. The paths appear similar ("empty yourself of bad
      things") but operate oppositely: Emptying withdraws from all influx; Restoration
      receives from Lord. Buddhism: problem is influx/desire itself → withdraw completely.
      Restoration: problem is OBSTRUCTION (proprium) preventing proper reception →
      receive without obstruction. Empirical data (NDEs) shows transformation through

      and commentators on Paul''s epistles. Key data: (1) Valentinus (c. 100-160 CE)
      claimed lineage from Paul through disciple Theudas - Valentinians produced first
      Pauline commentaries (Heracleon on John, Ptolemy); (2) Marcion (c. 85-160 CE)
      built entire church on 10-letter Pauline corpus, rejecting OT and non-Pauline
      NT; (3) Justin Martyr (mid-2nd c.) never mentions Paul by name - proto-orthodox
      reception was late and hesitant; (4) Pastoral Epistles (1-2 Tim, Titus) explicitly
      written to ''rescue'' Paul from Gnostic interpretation (domestication). Reception
      history indicates ''Gnostic reading'' was arguably original, requiring later
      suppression.'

      The "Historical Jesus" (E.P. Sanders'' "bedrock facts") is not opposed to the
      "Christ of Faith" but serves as the necessary external "vessel" (ultimate) for
      Divine Influx. Jesus''s life was a process of "Glorification"—the progressive
      union of finite human nature (from Mary) with infinite Divine nature (from Jehovah)—achieved
      through systematic conquest of the proprium in temptation. Two alternating states:
      Exinanition (emptying, human consciousness, separation from Father) and Glorification
      (union, Divine consciousness, "I and the Father are one"). The result is a new
      ontological category: the "Divine Human" with a "Divine Natural" body—neither
      pure spirit nor finite flesh but the bridge between Infinite and Finite.

    definition: 'The prophesied "New Church" (New Jerusalem) arising after the spiritual
      consummation of the Christian Church (Fourth Church). The Last Judgment (executed
      in the spiritual world in 1757, per Swedenborg) shattered the "falsity from
      self-intelligence" (faith alone doctrine) that had suffocated the Fourth Church
      (Christian). Daniel''s statue vision: Gold (Most Ancient, celestial love) →
      Silver (Ancient/Noah, charity/truth) → Bronze (Jewish beginning, natural good)
      → Iron/Clay (Christian Church - Fourth Church - Word mixed with self-intelligence
      from its beginning via Paul/James division). The "stone cut without hands" represents
      pure Divine Truth shattering all four human-constructed church systems, becoming
      a "great rock filling the earth" - a new foundation not bounded by the succession
      pattern. Two essentials define the New Church: (1) acknowledging the Lord alone
      as God of heaven and earth; (2) life according to the Decalogue (turning from
      evil, doing good). This is the "Church of Charity and Life"—direct antidote
      to "faith alone."

    notes: '"Key insight on receptivity: ''Gentiles'' in spiritual sense = those ''in
      the good of life'' from ANY religion, whose internal is ''open'' because they
      lack confirmed false principles. The ''learned'' are blocked by ''scholarly
      blindness''—intellectual pride that ''closes deeper levels.'' This explains
      why New Church establishes ''at first among few'' and ''successively increases.''
      The ''open heart'' has always had the ''longing'' (affection for truth) but
      lacked the truths; the New Church provides the truths that match their existing
      good. John 19:26-27 is charter: Church (Mary) and Charity (John) must ''dwell
      together'' in John''s ''home.''"

    definition: 'The correspondential decoding of 1 Enoch''s 364-day solar calendar
      as "Theology by  Geometry"—a symbolic system where astronomical measurements
      encode spiritual states  rather than physical accuracy. Core insight: 364 =
      52 × 7 (perfect Sabbath  divisibility), subordinating natural time to spiritual
      holiness. The calendar  describes the Celestial Church''s cognitive state where
      STATE (quality/holiness)  takes priority over TIME (quantity/motion). The deliberate
      "drift" from the physical  sun (~1.25 days/year) is not failed science but semiotic
      refusal to acknowledge a  state outside the Sabbath.

    definition: 'Nebuchadnezzar''s statue (Daniel 2:31-45) with four metal sections
      (gold, silver, bronze, iron-clay) destroyed by a stone "cut without hands."
      Swedenborg interprets the metals as both descending degrees of consciousness
      (celestial→spiritual→natural) and historical church succession (Most Ancient,
      Ancient, Jewish, Christian). The iron-clay feet have dual application: proximately
      the Jewish church at Lord''s first coming, internally the Christian church at
      consummation (1757). The stone represents the New Jerusalem/New Church. Corpus
      variations (AC 3325, AE 176, AE 411) show progressive refinement rather than
      contradiction. Comprehensive analysis in "The Statue and the Stone" thesis.

    notes: 'Foundational correspondence establishing historical framework for church
      decline and New Church emergence. CRITICAL: The iron-clay state is NOT separate
      Jewish and Christian applications. Rather, Jewish church PROGRESSES from pure
      iron (legs) to iron-clay mixing (feet) at its end, and Christian church BEGINS
      from this same iron-clay state. The transition is continuous. The crucifixion
      correspondence witnesses this: Jesus refuses vinegar-with-gall (Jewish church—truth
      entirely falsified) but accepts plain-vinegar (Christian church—truth mixed
      with ignorance that can be purified). The entire Christian dispensation carries
      the iron-clay mixing (faith separated from charity, truth without good) from
      inception. See comprehensive thesis for detailed analysis.

    definition: 'Swedenborg''s doctrine that Jesus''s earthly life alternated between
      two distinct conscious states. (1) State of Exinanition (Emptying): Jesus was
      conscious primarily in His finite human nature from Mary, experiencing genuine
      human weakness, doubt, prayer, and the "cry of dereliction" on the cross. This
      state was necessary for Him to face temptation as a human—if fully conscious
      of His Divinity, temptation would be impossible. (2) State of Glorification
      (Union): Jesus was conscious in His internal Divine nature, declaring "I and
      the Father are one" (John 10:30). These were moments of transfiguration and
      miracles where Divine Influx overwhelmed the vessel. The Glorification process
      was accomplished through temptations—spiritual combats fought from the assumed
      finite nature.

    definition: 'Swedenborg himself recognized his writings as instrumental, not final.
      He described the New Jerusalem (final church) as using his works to "take thence
      those things which they consider useful"—not founding itself in his writings
      but receiving truth through direct influx from the Lord. This establishes the
      framework''s methodological stance: Swedenborg''s FRAMEWORK (correspondences,
      influx, two-tiered reality) is tested as hypothesis; his SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS
      based on 18th-century science may be incorrect and must be revised using modern
      data. Examples: (1) "Soul from father, body from mother" (ovism/preformationism)—contradicts
      modern genetics showing both parents contribute DNA, and contradicts his own
      teaching that physical IS spiritual in ultimates; (2) Geographic predictions
      (Africa as location of new church)—likely correspondential states, not literal
      geography; (3) Limbus and anti-reincarnation arguments built on false heredity
      assumptions. The framework honors Swedenborg by doing what HE did: hypothesis-testing
      with best available scientific data. His multiple inconsistent explanations
      of Daniel''s statue across his corpus demonstrate he was working through these
      correspondences, not receiving inerrant revelation.

    notes: 'FRAMEWORK SYNTHESIS: The interpretation that corpus variations demonstrate
      "guided influx through developing vessel" applies Swedenborg''s doctrine of
      influx to analyze his own development. The three-stage progression (general
      recognition → structural distinction → universal pattern) is analytical framework
      created by thesis author. This integrates "progressive revelation" (divine guidance)
      with "hypothesis-testing" (human cognition): influx works THROUGH Swedenborg''s
      rational processes, not bypassing them. Primary Swedenborg citations (AC § 3325,
      AE §§ 176, 411, HH § 197) require verification beyond thesis quotes.


      Extraction notes:CORRECTED 2026-01-08: Changed sample_size and replication to
      na—these factors don''t apply to textual analysis. INTERNAL track. The analysis
      examines 6 primary Swedenborg passages (AC 3325, AE 83, 176, 410, 411, 483,
      519) comparing his treatment of Daniel''s statue chronologically (1749-1756
      vs 1759-1760). The PROOF is in reading the primary texts and observing progressive
      refinement patterns. The "progressive revelation" interpretation is framework
      synthesis applied to verifiable textual progression. METHODOLOGY: textual_critical—systematic
      chronological comparison with direct quotations. SAMPLE_SIZE: na (not applicable
      to textual analysis). TRANSPARENCY: full—complete citations, direct quotes,
      clear distinction between Swedenborg''s words and framework interpretation.
      SOURCE_DATA_QUALITY: peer_reviewed_book (standard Swedenborg Foundation scholarly
      editions). REPLICATION: na (textual analysis doesn''t require replication).
      STRENGTHS: Chronological rigor, cross-validation via crucifixion correspondence,
      internally consistent with Swedenborg''s gradual influx doctrine. LIMITATIONS:
      Interpretive leap (variations as guided influx vs changing mind), no external
      validation, analysis of single correspondence, translation-dependent. Would
      benefit from independent Swedenborg scholar verification and broader corpus
      analysis showing similar refinement patterns across other correspondences.

    definition: 'Ancient prophecies (Saoshyant, Messiah) perceive eternal truth—the
      Lord as He expresses through unobstructed humanity—not temporal future events.
      Saoshyant and similar figures are ARCHETYPES (states of pure love and truth)
      not biographical predictions. Prophets perceive spiritual reality upward and
      write it correspondentially: virgin birth = pure reception without proprium,
      celestial sign = spiritual light appearing, defeat of evil = proprium conquered.
      Gospel writers IMPOSED these correspondences onto proto-Luke narratives to express
      spiritual truth through Jesus—historically inaccurate but correspondentially
      TRUE. Prophecies are "self-fulfilling" because truth grounds itself: spiritual
      reality (Lord as He eternally IS) progresses toward expression in ultimates.
      Knowing truth = knowing "future" because reality moves toward truth grounding.
      Jesus demonstrated complete expression (zero obstruction), making visible what
      was always true. NDE experiencers recognize the Being of Light because they
      perceive the same eternal Lord expressing.
