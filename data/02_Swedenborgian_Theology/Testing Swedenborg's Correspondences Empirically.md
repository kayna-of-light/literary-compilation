# **The Semiotics of the Spirit: An Empirical and Hermeneutic Validation of Swedenborg’s Doctrine of Correspondences Against the Canon of the New Church**

## **1\. Introduction: The Epistemological Crisis and the Architecture of "The Word"**

The theological corpus of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) presents one of the most audacious claims in the history of Western metaphysics: the assertion that the Sacred Scriptures, specifically termed "The Word," are structured according to a universal, immutable code known as the "Science of Correspondences." This doctrine posits that the natural world and the spiritual world are linked not by poetic metaphor or arbitrary allegory, but by a rigorous law of **vertical causality** and **influx**. Within this framework, every natural object mentioned in the inspired text—be it a lion, a honeycomb, a mountain, or a garment—serves as the phenomenological anchor for a specific spiritual reality.

However, this system introduces a radical disruption to the traditional Christian canon. Swedenborg enforces a strict demarcation between books that constitute "The Word" (Lingua Divina) and those that are merely "writings" (Lingua Ecclesiastica). The former are dictated by immediate divine inspiration and contain a continuous, unbroken **internal sense**; the latter are products of mediate inspiration, filtered through the intellects of their human authors, and devoid of this continuous internal series. This distinction leads to the controversial exclusion of the **Acts of the Apostles** and the **Epistles of Paul** from the Swedenborgian canon of "The Word," relegating them to the status of "good books for the church" but denying them the infinite depth of the Divine style.

This research report undertakes an empirical and hermeneutic stress test of this doctrine. We do not presuppose Swedenborg’s authority. Instead, we apply the independent methodological framework outlined in *The Hermeneutics of the Mundus Imaginalis* 1 to two distinct bodies of text:

1. **The Control Group:** The narrative of **Samson in the Book of Judges** (specifically Chapter 14). Swedenborg classifies Judges as "The Word," yet he provides no continuous commentary on it comparable to his *Arcana Coelestia* (Genesis/Exodus) or *Apocalypse Revealed*. This makes it an ideal "blind" test case to see if the system holds when applied to a text Swedenborg treated only in scattered references.  
2. **The Experimental Group:** The **Acts of the Apostles** (specifically the conversion of Saul in Chapter 9\) and the **Pauline Epistles** (specifically Romans 8). These are texts Swedenborg explicitly excludes. If his theory is objectively valid—that is, if it describes a structural property of the text rather than a subjective superimposition—then the application of correspondential analysis to these books should result in hermeneutic failure, fragmentation, or incoherence.

The inquiry is driven by the question: Can the "Science of Correspondences" function as a verifiable semiotic tool that distinguishes "The Word" from "The Writings" based on internal structural isomorphism?

### **1.1 The Theoretical Framework: Symbol vs. Allegory**

To evaluate the texts, we must first establish the criteria for a valid correspondence. The methodology provided 1 draws on the literary distinction between **symbol** (organic) and **allegory** (arbitrary), a distinction sharpened by the Swedenborgian concept of influx.

* **The Law of Influx:** The natural world exists only as the "ultimate" or "container" of the spiritual world. A natural object (e.g., a Lion) exists *because* a specific spiritual affection (e.g., the Power of Truth) flows into nature and clothes itself in that form. Therefore, the relationship is **causal** and **ontological**. The Lion *is* the Power of Truth in a natural form.  
* **The Criteria of Validity:**  
  1. **Origin:** Is the meaning inherent in the function of the object (Symbol) or invented by the author (Allegory)?  
  2. **Continuity:** Does the spiritual sense form a coherent, unbroken narrative sequence (Series) or does it fragment into isolated moral lessons?  
  3. **Universality:** Is the correspondence consistent across different books and authors of "The Word"?

By triangulating these criteria against the text, we can determine if the "internal sense" is a genuine property of the document or a theological fiction.

**2\. The Control Case: The Correspondential Exegesis of Judges 14 (Samson and the Lion)**

The Book of Judges is classified by Swedenborg as "The Word".2 Critics often view the Samson cycle (Judges 13–16) as a collection of disjointed folktales, solar myths, or bawdy heroic exploits. However, under the lens of correspondence, the narrative is posited to be a precise description of the **Celestial Man** (the highest degree of regeneration) and the **Lord’s Glorification** (the subjugation of the hells).

We focus our analysis on **Judges 14**, the narrative of Samson’s descent to Timnath, his battle with the lion, and the subsequent discovery of honey in the carcass.

### **2.1 The Topography of the Soul: The Descent to Timnath**

The narrative begins: *"And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines"* (Judges 14:1).

* **Geographical Correspondence:** In the Swedenborgian lexicon, geography is never accidental. **Canaan** represents the Church or the Kingdom of Heaven. **Philistia**, situated on the sea coast, corresponds to the faculty of **knowledge** or the **intellect** separated from the will.4 The Philistines, throughout the Word, signify those who are in "Faith Alone" (Sola Fide)—they possess the knowledges of truth (they dwell in the land) but are "uncircumcised" (unpurified in love/charity).5  
* **The Directional Flow:** Samson "goes down" (*yarad*). Spiritually, elevation refers to the interior/spiritual qualities (Mountains), while descent refers to the exterior/natural qualities (Valleys/Plains). Samson, representing the **Celestial Natural** (the power of good in the external man), descends into the region of the intellect (Timnath) to initiate a conjunction.  
* **The Marriage:** He seeks a Philistine wife. This mirrors the spiritual necessity that "Good" (Samson) must cloak itself in "Truth" (Philistine woman) to become effective. The internal sense here describes the Lord (or the regenerating man) descending into the realm of mere doctrinal knowledge to adapt it for service.6

**Validation:** The correspondence holds structurally. The "descent" is a necessary psychological movement: the will must enter the intellect to act. The "Philistine" connection explains the recurring biblical theme of the "uncircumcised" intellect which holds truth but lacks charity—a state Swedenborg identifies as the primary antagonist of the New Church.4

### **2.2 The Phenomenological Lion: The Roar of Falsity**

*"And behold, a young lion roared against him"* (Judges 14:5).

* **The Symbol of the Lion:** In the animal kingdom, the lion is the apex predator, representing supreme power. In correspondence, this power is bivalent (the "Opposite Sense" principle 1):  
  1. **Positive:** The "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (Rev 5:5) represents the **Power of Divine Truth** fighting for salvation.7  
  2. **Negative:** The lion represents the **Power of Falsity** derived from self-love, which destroys truth.8  
* **Contextual Analysis:** The lion appears in the *vineyards* of Timnath. A **vineyard** corresponds to the **Spiritual Church** or the affection for truth (Wine \= Truth).9 The lion is "roaring against" Samson. This context dictates the negative sense: it is the power of false reasoning (Philistine intellect) attacking the nascent spiritual church (Vineyard) and the Celestial Good (Samson).  
* **The Act of Tearing:** *"And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid"* (Judges 14:6).  
  * The "kid" (young goat) corresponds to **innocence** or the innocence of the natural man.11  
  * *The Internal Sense:* The regenerating man, empowered by the Lord (Spirit coming mightily), overcomes the terrifying power of falsity (Lion) with the same ease that one handles innocence. It signifies that to the Lord, the power of hell is nothing; it is dissipated instantly by the presence of Divine Truth.  
* **Validation:** The symbolism is organic. The lion’s roar is the terrifying intimidation of false dogma (e.g., "you are condemned without faith"). The "tearing" is the analysis and dispersion of this dogma. The comparison to a "kid" introduces a paradox in the letter (tearing a lion like a kid?) that is resolved only in the internal sense: to the celestial man, the "Lion" of hell has no more substance than a passive "Kid."

### **2.3 The Arcanum of the Honey: The Transformation of the Proprium**

"And after a time he returned... and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion" (Judges 14:8).  
This image is zoologically bizarre (bees avoid putrefaction), signaling a demand for semiotic decoding.

* **The Carcass:** The dead lion represents the **subjugated proprium** (ego-self). The power of falsity has been destroyed; the "life" of self-love is gone. It is now a vessel.8  
* **The Bees:**  
  * *Natural Function:* Bees are industrious, communal, and gatherers of nectar (hidden sweetness) to produce honey.  
  * *Correspondence:* Bees signify the **rational faculty** acting from a love of use. They gather the "nectar" of knowledge from the "flowers" of the Word to construct the "honey" of wisdom.12  
* **The Honey:**  
  * *Symbol:* Honey corresponds to **natural delight** or the sweetness of the natural degree when it is ordered by the spiritual. It is the external pleasure of good.13  
  * *Scriptural Consistency:* John the Baptist ate "locusts and wild honey" because he represented the *external* sense of the Word.12 The "land flowing with milk and honey" is a state rich in spiritual instruction (milk) and natural delight (honey).15  
* **The Riddle:** *"Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness"* (Judges 14:14).  
  * *The Eater (Lion):* The devouring nature of the ego/falsity.  
  * *The Meat (Food):* Goodness/Charity.  
  * *The Strong (Lion):* The power of the will.  
  * *The Sweetness (Honey):* The delight of use.  
  * *The Internal Sense:* This describes the central arcanum of **Regeneration**. One cannot simply "be good." One must first confront and slay the "Lion" (the aggressive, selfish proprium). Once this ego is slain (subjugated), the Lord transforms that very vessel (the carcass) into a source of use. The "strength" of the ego is converted into the "sweetness" of charity. The "eater" (that which consumed life) now provides "meat" (sustenance).

### **2.4 The Structural Integrity of the Samson Narrative**

The application of Swedenborg’s key to Judges 14 reveals a startling **structural isomorphism**. The narrative does not break down into disjointed moralisms; it maintains a rigorous cause-and-effect sequence:

1. **Descent** (Influx into the natural).  
2. **Conflict** (Temptation by falsity/Lion).  
3. **Victory** (Subjugation of the Proprium).  
4. **Fruition** (The emergence of spiritual delight/Honey from the conquered state).

This sequence perfectly mirrors the Swedenborgian doctrine of **Regeneration** (Repentance \-\> Reformation \-\> Regeneration).16 The symbols are not arbitrary; "Honey" always means natural delight, "Lion" always means power (good or bad). The text behaves as a coherent organism, validating its status as "The Word" under the definitions of the New Church.

**3\. The Experimental Case I: The Acts of the Apostles (Chapter 9\)**

We now turn to the **Acts of the Apostles**, a book Swedenborg explicitly excludes from "The Word." He grants that the Apostles were inspired, but argues their inspiration was "mediate"—filtered through their own minds—rather than "immediate" dictation.17 Consequently, Acts is a "historical" and "doctrinal" book, valuable for the church but lacking the infinite internal sense.18

If this distinction is valid, applying the correspondence key to Acts 9 (The Conversion of Saul) should result in "noise"—a lack of continuous spiritual narrative—despite the presence of potentially symbolic elements like "Light" and "Blindness."

### **3.1 The Narrative of Conversion: Visual vs. Auditory Contradictions**

The account of Saul’s conversion appears in Acts 9, 22, and 26\.

* **The Light:** *"And suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven"* (Acts 9:3).  
  * *Correspondence:* Light corresponds to **Divine Truth**.  
  * *Internal Sense Potential:* Truth flows into the mind of the Jewish Church (Saul), exposing its falsity. So far, the correspondence seems plausible.  
* **The Breakdown of Continuity:** The narrative immediately encounters the problem of textual variation, which breaks the *container* necessary for a continuous internal sense.  
  * *Acts 9:7:* The men "stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."  
  * *Acts 22:9:* "They that were with me saw indeed the light... but they heard not the voice."  
  * *Critical Analysis:* Biblical scholars acknowledge this as a "literary exigency" or rhetorical variation by the author (Luke).20  
  * *Swedenborgian Analysis:* In "The Word," a contradiction in the letter (e.g., God repenting vs. not repenting) signals a shift in the *level* of the internal sense (from appearance to reality).22 However, in Acts, these contradictions are sensory and historical. If "Hearing" corresponds to **Obedience/Will** and "Seeing" to **Understanding/Faith** 23, the text asserts simultaneously that the companions *did* obey/perceive (heard) and *did not* obey/perceive (heard not). The symbolism cancels itself out. There is no spiritual "arc" here; there is a historical discrepancy regarding sensory data. The container is "leaky."

### **3.2 The Problem of Historical Particularity: Ananias and Judas**

*"Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus... And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias"* (Acts 9:11-10).

* **The Street "Straight":**  
  * *Correspondence:* "Street" signifies **truths of doctrine**; "Straight" signifies alignment with Good.24  
  * *Analysis:* This seems symbolic. However, the "Street Called Straight" (Via Recta) is a literal, historical Roman road in Damascus.26 In "The Word" (e.g., the encampments of Israel), Swedenborg argues that the geography itself was *arranged* or *selected* by Divine Providence specifically to mirror spiritual states.19 In Acts, the narrative is bound by the *actual* geography. The correspondence is accidental, not essential. Paul went to the Via Recta because that’s where the house was, not because the Word needed to express a state of "Straight Truth."  
* **The "Ananias" Discontinuity:**  
  * In Acts 5, a man named **Ananias** lies to the Holy Spirit and drops dead.23 In Acts 9, a man named **Ananias** heals Paul.25  
  * *Correspondence Test:* If "Ananias" is a symbol in a continuous Word, the name should carry a consistent spiritual signification (like "Ephraim" always meaning the Intellectual).  
  * *Acts 5 Ananias:* Represents **Profanation** or Hypocrisy (mixing good with evil).  
  * *Acts 9 Ananias:* Represents **Charity** or the instrument of Introduction to the Church.  
  * *Conclusion:* The name "Ananias" functions as a historical identifier, not a spiritual category. The lack of consistency proves the text is "historical" (recording events involving two different guys named Ananias) rather than "correspondential" (using a name to signify a distinct spiritual entity).

### **3.3 The Scales: Allegory vs. Correspondence**

*"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales"* (Acts 9:18).

* **Symbol:** "Scales" (of fish/serpent) correspond to the **sensual** and **corporeal** degree—the lowest level of the mind that relies on the senses.28  
* **Analysis:** The falling of scales signifies the removal of the sensual fallacy (that the Law saves) to allow the influx of spiritual truth.  
* **Comparison:** This is the strongest correspondential image in the chapter. However, Swedenborgians argue that while the Apostles experienced *visions* that were spiritual (and thus correspondential), their *writing* of them was not dictated by the Lord. Luke describes the scales as a physical/medical phenomenon (Luke was a physician). The correspondence is present because the *event* was spiritual, not because the *text* is constructed to contain an infinite series. It is a "gem" of correspondence in a setting of historical prose, unlike the continuous "river of gold" in the Word.17

**Verdict on Acts:** The application of the methodology reveals a text that contains isolated symbols but fails the test of **continuity**. The symbols (Light, Scales) are interspersed with historical data (Ananias, Judas, Tarsus) that resist spiritual transliteration. The text informs the reader about the early church; it does not *regenerate* the reader by restructuring their internal mind in the same mechanism as the Psalms or Prophets.19

**4\. The Experimental Case II: The Pauline Epistles (Romans)**

Paul’s Epistle to the Romans is the theological backbone of Protestantism. Swedenborg, however, regarded Paul’s writings as "doctrinal," containing no internal sense.17 The Epistles are written in **abstract arguments**, not **correspondential images**.

### **4.1 The Abstract vs. The Concrete**

The "Science of Correspondences" requires a "container" (Natural Object) and a "content" (Spiritual Truth).

* **Judges 14:** Container \= Lion (Concrete). Content \= Power of Falsity (Abstract).  
* **Romans 8:2:** *"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."*  
  * *Analysis:* Here, Paul explicitly names the *content* (Spirit, Life, Sin, Death, Law). He does not use a "container." He does not say "The Eagle has freed me from the Serpent." He speaks directly in abstract theological terms.  
  * *Hermeneutic Failure:* You cannot apply correspondence to Romans because the text is already "naked." There is no "letter" to unfold; the letter *is* the doctrine. To interpret "Spirit" as "Truth" is a tautology, not a correspondence. Swedenborg argues that because the Epistles lack this "covering," they cannot contain the "Infinite" wisdom of the celestial angels, which requires the complex containment system of natural symbols to exist.30

### **4.2 The Theological Divergence: Faith Alone**

The central conflict between Swedenborg and Paul (or the Protestant interpretation of Paul) lies in **Romans 3:28**: *"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."*

* **The Lutheran/Pauline View:** This is the bedrock of *Sola Fide* (Faith Alone).  
* **The Swedenborgian Critique:** Swedenborg claimed that the "Dragon" in Revelation signifies the doctrine of "Faith Alone".32 He argued that Paul’s Epistles were permitted by Providence to be the focus of the Christian Church *precisely because* they lack an internal sense; if the Church had applied its false "Faith Alone" theology to the *true* Word (Gospels/Revelation) with the same intensity, they would have "profaned" it.19  
* **The "Gnostic Vector":** Research suggests Paul represents a "Gnostic vector"—a move away from the "Historical Jesus" (Jamesian/Works) toward a "Christ of Revelation" (Pauline/Faith).20  
  * *Swedenborg’s View:* Paul "received nothing from the life and discourse of the Lord" (parables/works) but derived his gospel from his own internal revelations.19 This confirms his inspiration was **mediate** (personal/subjective) rather than **immediate** (dictated).  
  * *Implication:* Paul’s theology is a "human" attempt to systematize the Christ event. It is "good for the church" as a doctrinal bridge, but it is structurally incapable of bearing the "Celestial Sense" because it originates from a human mind (Paul's) rather than the Divine Mind flowing directly into ultimates.33

### **4.3 The Empirical Test: Interpreting Romans 8**

Let us attempt to force a correspondential reading of Romans 8:19: *"For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God."*

* *Creature (Creation):* Could correspond to the "External Man."  
* *Sons of God:* Could correspond to "Divine Truths."  
* *Result:* "The external man waits for the influx of Divine Truths."  
* *Critique:* While possible, this is a philosophical abstraction, not a semiotic decoding. In the Word, "Creation" (Genesis 1\) is a rigorous 7-stage map of regeneration. In Romans, "Creation" is a rhetorical device used to illustrate a theological point about suffering. The "depth" is intellectual, not ontological. The text does not "open" into heaven; it "speaks about" heaven.

**Verdict on Romans:** The Epistles fail the correspondence test because they are written in a different *language game*. They use **logic and rhetoric** (logos), whereas the Word uses **symbol and representative** (mythos/correspondence). They are transparent to the intellect but opaque to the "science of correspondences."

**5\. Comparative Analysis: "The Word" vs. "The Writings"**

### **5.1 Structural Isomorphism**

The empirical comparison reveals a fundamental structural difference between the two categories.

| Feature | "The Word" (e.g., Judges 14\) | "The Writings" (e.g., Acts/Romans) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Texture** | Symbolic, often disjointed images (Honey in carcass). | Logical, linear, argumentative, or historical. |
| **Continuity** | Unbroken internal sense (Regeneration sequence). | Broken/Episodic (Historical) or Abstract (Logic). |
| **Names** | Fixed Correspondences (Philistine \= Faith Alone). | Historical Personages (Ananias \= variable). |
| **Geography** | Representative (Timnath \= Intellectual sphere). | Literal/Accidental (Street Straight \= Roman road). |
| **Origin** | Dictation (Immediate Inspiration). | Inspiration of thought (Mediate Inspiration). |
| **Depth** | Infinite (Celestial/Spiritual/Natural senses). | Finite (Intended meaning of the author). |

### **5.2 The Phenomenological Validation**

Swedenborg’s claim is not just literary but phenomenological. He asserts that in the **Mundus Imaginalis** (Spiritual World), the texts of "The Word" appear as radiant light, while the Epistles do not.34

* *Control:* When the story of Samson is read in heaven, angels do not see a man killing a lion; they perceive the Lord subjugating the hells. The lion *is* the form of that subjugation.  
* *Experimental:* When Romans is read, angels perceive Paul’s thoughts on grace. They see the *mind of Paul*, not the *Mind of God* directly. The Epistles mediate the presence of the Lord through a human lens; "The Word" presents the Lord directly in ultimates.

## ---

**6\. Conclusion: The Verdict on the Swedenborgian Canon**

The application of the independent hermeneutic methodology confirms that Swedenborg’s exclusion of the Epistles and Acts is **methodologically consistent** and **empirically verifiable** within the logic of his system.

1. **Validation of "The Word":** The narrative of **Judges 14** translates successfully into a coherent, non-arbitrary account of regeneration. The bizarre details (Lion, Honey, Nazirite) function as "organic" correspondences, grounded in the nature of the objects and linked by vertical causality. The text behaves as a "container" for a higher sense.  
2. **differentiation of "The Writings":**  
   * **Acts 9** contains correspondential elements (visions) but fails the **continuity test**. Its narrative structure is determined by historical exigency, not spiritual sequence. Names and places function as data, not archetypes.  
   * **Paul’s Epistles** fail the **mode test**. They are written in abstract theological language, not correspondential imagery. They are "naked" doctrine, valuable for instruction but structurally distinct from the "clothed" Divine Truth of the Word.

**Final Implication:** The "Science of Correspondences" acts as a rigorous filter. It demonstrates that the Swedenborgian canon is not an arbitrary selection but a recognition of two fundamentally different modes of divine communication: **Immediate Revelation** (The Word) which creates a direct conduit to the celestial heavens, and **Mediate Revelation** (The Apostolic Writings) which serves to instruct the rational mind of the church. The empirical test confirms that while Paul speaks *about* the Spirit, Samson *is* the Spirit in the language of representatives. The distinction holds.
