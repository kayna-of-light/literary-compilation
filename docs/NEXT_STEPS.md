## ⚠️ Pending Work

### Priority 3: Fill Evidence Gaps (7/7) ✅
**Timeline:** Completed January 8, 2026  
**Importance:** High - These are "smoking gun" cases

1. ✅ **CONSC-077:** Stevenson's Imad Elawar Case
   - 57 verified statements
   - One of strongest DOPS cases
   - Falsifies information leakage critique

2. ✅ **CONSC-078:** van Lommel Cardiac Arrest Study
   - Lancet 2001 publication
   - Prospective design (gold standard)
   - NDEs during flatline EEG

3. ✅ **CONSC-079:** AWARE Study (Parnia)
   - Large-scale cardiac arrest study
   - Methodological rigor
   - Veridical perception testing

4. ✅ **SWED-049:** Daniel's Statue Correspondence
   - Four Churches = Four Metals (Daniel 2:31-45)
   - Gold → Silver → Iron/Clay → Stone
   - Critical for Fourth Church theology

5. ✅ **SWED-050:** Exinanition/Glorification States
   - Two states doctrine for Jesus
   - Explains how temptation was real
   - Critical for CROSS-018 expansion

6. ✅ **EARLY-019:** Jerusalem Council (Acts 15)
   - Paul vs James documented conflict
   - Historical evidence of divergence
   - Critical for CROSS-019 validation

7. ✅ **EARLY-020:** Ebionite Christianity
   - Jamesian continuation after 70 CE
   - Original movement preservation
   - Shows what was lost when Paul won

**Completed:** All 7 nodes processed using full Document Processing Workflow:
- Knowledge Compiler identified 33 missing connections (19 high-priority implemented)
- Source Tracer verified sources, corrected 6 file paths, added missing sources
- Confidence Extractor analyzed evidence nodes, added confidence_factors to EARLY-019/020
- Critic identified 6 valid critiques (all non-proof-breaking, all addressed)
- Graph Reviewer validated: **PASS** ✅

### Priority 4: Strengthen Inter-Domain Connections
**Timeline:** Ongoing  
**Importance:** Medium - Improves graph coherence

**Targets:**
- Add 50+ connections between SWED ↔ CONSC
- Add 30+ connections between BIBL ↔ SWED
- Add 20+ connections between EARLY ↔ GNOS

**Method:**
1. Review SWED nodes systematically
2. For each node, search CONSC domain for related evidence
3. Add "validates", "supported_by", "instantiates" connections
4. Repeat for BIBL↔SWED and EARLY↔GNOS

**Next Action:** Run systematic connection audit or continue with Priority 3/5.

---

### Priority 5: Documentation Reconciliation
**Timeline:** Within 1 Month  
**Importance:** High - Ensures completeness

**Documents to Process:**

1. ⬜ **Heart of the Matter**
   - Daniel's Statue correspondence details
   - "Gentiles" as spiritual state (not ethnic)
   - Iron/Clay as Word + Self-Intelligence
   - Sola Fide as Third Church failure

2. ⬜ **Divine Human in Ultimates**
   - Two states doctrine (detailed)
   - Maternal human vs Divine human process
   - Criterion of temptation expanded
   - Historical Jesus as external form of Love

3. ⬜ **Remaining 00_Framework documents**
   - Scan for claims not yet in graph
   - Prioritize synthesis concepts
   - Add as needed

4. ⬜ **data/unclassified/ directory**
   - Classify and process documents
   - Move to appropriate domains
   - Extract nodes as needed

**Next Action:** Use Document Processing Workflow (Knowledge Compiler → Source Tracer → Confidence Extractor → Critic → Graph Reviewer).

## Recommended Next Step

**✅ Priority 3 Complete!** All 7 critical evidence nodes successfully added via full document processing workflow.

**Option A: Begin Document Reconciliation (Priority 5)**
- Systematic processing ensures completeness
- May reveal additional missing nodes
- Feeds into all domains
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks
- **Recommended: Start here for comprehensive coverage**

**Option B: Strengthen Connections (Priority 4)**
- Improves graph coherence
- Makes synthesis more visible
- Ongoing maintenance task
- Timeline: Continuous
- Can be done alongside Priority 5

**Option C: Pause and Assess**
- Review current state before continuing
- Identify any gaps in Priority 3 implementation
- Plan Priority 5 document processing strategy

**Current Recommendation:** Proceed with **Priority 5** (document processing) using the proven workflow. Start with "Heart of the Matter" document for systematic extraction of Daniel's Statue details and other missing framework claims.

## Questions for User

1. ✅ **Priority 3 Complete!** Should we proceed with Priority 5 (document processing) or Priority 4 (connection strengthening)?
2. Are there specific documents in unclassified/ that are high priority?
3. Should we process "Heart of the Matter" first (Daniel's Statue details) or another Priority 5 document?
4. Are there any new documents or findings to add to the processing queue?
5. Do you want to review the 7 new evidence nodes before continuing, or proceed immediately to Priority 5?
