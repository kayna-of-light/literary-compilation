  node_types:
    foundational: Axiomatic domain anchors tested by coherence and fruits
    concept: Stable framework constructs derived from foundational premises
    hypothesis: Testable claims derived from concepts with empirical expectations
    evidence: Empirical or textual findings that ground hypotheses
    synthesis: Integrations combining concepts across domains or foundations
  relationship_types:
    supports: Evidence epistemically supports a hypothesis one level up
    contradicts: Evidence refutes or challenges a hypothesis one level up
    supported_by: Hypothesis acknowledges supporting evidence (inverse of supports)
    contradicted_by: Hypothesis acknowledges refuting evidence (inverse of contradicts)

    developed_by: Up-chain inverse of develops
    integrates_into: Concept integrates into a synthesis
    integrated_from: Inverse of integrates_into
    parallels: Same-level observational resonance
