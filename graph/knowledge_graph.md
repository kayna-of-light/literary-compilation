#### [CONSC-001] Hemispheric Worldviews as Ontological Modes

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: unknown

> The right hemisphere (“Master”) attends to reality as an embodied, relational, flowing whole, while the left (“Emissary”) constructs a decontextualized, controllable map; the corpus callosum gates integration, so the lived world shifts with which mode predominates.


**Source Chain**:
1. [T] data/01_Consciousness_Studies/Brain, Myth, and Conscious Choice.md

**Connections**:
- → `FND-TEST-001` (developed_by): Foundational test anchor develops hemispheric worldview concept
- → `CONSC-002` (develops): Hypothesis derives from hemispheric worldview concept
- → `CONSC-003` (develops): Neuroplasticity/attention hypothesis developed from hemispheric worldview concept

#### [CONSC-002] Left-Hemisphere Dominance Drives Division and Materialist Culture

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: unknown

> When the Emissary’s narrow, utilitarian mode dominates, neural patterns (greed, threat vigilance, ego-centricity) cascade into psychological materialism, meaning crisis, and cultural architectures that reward fragmentation (standardized testing, social media echo chambers).


**Source Chain**:
1. [T] data/01_Consciousness_Studies/Brain, Myth, and Conscious Choice.md

**Connections**:
- → `CONSC-001` (developed_by): Hypothesis derives from hemispheric worldview concept

#### [CONSC-003] Directed Attention and Contemplative Practice Rebalance Hemispheres

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: unknown

> Neuroplasticity is steered by intentional attention; practices like mindfulness and compassion training systematically strengthen integrative networks and down-regulate threat circuits, enabling a voluntary shift toward the Master’s empathic, connected mode.


**Source Chain**:
1. [T] data/01_Consciousness_Studies/Brain, Myth, and Conscious Choice.md

**Connections**:
- → `CONSC-001` (developed_by): Neuroplasticity/attention hypothesis developed from hemispheric worldview concept
- → `CONSC-004` (developed_by): Participatory cosmos concept develops neuroplasticity integration hypothesis

#### [CONSC-004] Integrated Mind and Participatory Cosmos

**Status**: preliminary | **Confidence**: unknown

> The unified, right-led worldview aligns with holistic/participatory metaphysics (process philosophy, implicate order, participatory universe) and archetypal unity myths (Genesis 1), contrasting the reductionist, conflict-based cosmology of the Emissary’s materialist dogma.


**Source Chain**:
1. [T] data/01_Consciousness_Studies/Brain, Myth, and Conscious Choice.md

**Connections**:
- → `FND-TEST-001` (developed_by): Foundational test anchor develops integrated mind concept

**Connections**:
- → `CONC-TEST-001` (developed_by): Hypothesis is developed by the first concept
- → `CONC-TEST-002` (developed_by): Hypothesis is developed by the second concept
- → `EVID-TEST-001` (supported_by): Hypothesis is supported by the first evidence case
- → `EVID-TEST-002` (supported_by): Hypothesis is supported by the second evidence case
