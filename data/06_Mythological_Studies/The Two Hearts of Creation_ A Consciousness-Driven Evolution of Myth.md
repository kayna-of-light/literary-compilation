# **The Two Hearts of Creation: A Consciousness-Driven Evolution of Myth**

## **I. A New Paradigm: Consciousness as the Engine of Memetic Evolution**

The vast chasm between the Babylonian *Enuma Elish*, a story of cosmic warfare and divine slavery, and the serene, orderly account of Genesis 1, a story of a single benevolent Creator, presents a profound puzzle in cultural evolution. Such a gap seems too wide to be bridged by simple adaptation or polemic. A more compelling model suggests that humans, as natural *bricoleurs*, adapt stories that "almost align" with the truths they hold in their hearts, rather than performing a complete overhaul of something they deem heretical. This implies that these two narratives are not merely rivals, but the end-points of two long, divergent evolutionary paths that began from a common ancestor—a proto-myth—and were guided at every step by the fundamental state of consciousness of the cultures that told them.  
To understand this process, we can employ a post-materialist scientific framework known as the Consciousness-Driven Evolution (CDE) hypothesis. This model proposes that consciousness is not a passive byproduct of material processes but an active, driving force in our collective development. It argues that consciousness itself acts as a primary driver of *memetic*, not genetic, evolution. The foundational ideas, values, and stories (memes) that define a civilization are selected for based on their resonance with the underlying orientation of the collective consciousness.  
At the heart of this model is a fundamental polarity within consciousness, termed the "ruling love." This is the core orientation that an individual or a society freely chooses, establishing its fundamental character. This polarity has two opposing forms:

1. **A Love of Self and the World:** An orientation that manifests as a desire for power, control, and selfish gratification.  
2. **A Love of God and the Neighbor:** An orientation that manifests as a desire for wisdom, truth, and a life of useful service to the collective good.

According to the CDE hypothesis, these two "ruling loves" create two distinct selective pressures on the memetic landscape, pushing societies and their stories along two opposing evolutionary trajectories. By applying this model, we can trace how a single, simple proto-myth of creation could evolve into two radically different accounts, each a perfect reflection of the heart of its people. The plausibility of this entire framework rests on the premise that consciousness is a fundamental force, not merely an illusion generated by the brain—a premise supported by a significant body of anomalous data that challenges conventional materialist worldviews.

## **II. The Primordial Matrix: A Common Ancestor Myth**

The creation stories of the Ancient Near East share a common narrative grammar, pointing to a shared ancestor myth that likely contained a few core, unadorned elements reflecting the shared environment and fundamental questions of the region's earliest peoples. This proto-myth was a story of *functional* creation—the bringing of order to a pre-existing, non-functional chaos—and likely included these key stages :

* A primordial, formless, watery state.  
* The separation of this chaos into distinct realms (sky and sea).  
* The emergence of dry land.  
* The creation of humanity from clay.  
* A period of divine rest.

This simple, shared narrative was the primordial memetic material. It was neutral, a blank canvas. The direction of its evolution would be determined entirely by the "ruling love" of the cultures that inherited it.

## **III. Trajectory B: The Evolution Toward Fragmentation and Power**

The CDE hypothesis predicts that a collective consciousness dominated by a "love of self and the world" will evolve toward societal fragmentation, competition, and the instrumentalization of knowledge for power. This creates a memetic environment that selects for and amplifies stories that reflect and justify this state of being.  
The evolution of the *Enuma Elish* is the archetypal example of this trajectory. The storytellers, or *bricoleurs*, of Mesopotamia, guided by a heart that valued power and hierarchy, began with the simple proto-myth. The "small step" that set them on the path of division was the fusion of this creation story with a separate, pre-existing, and popular story type: the "chaos-combat" myth. Earlier Sumerian tales of hero-gods like Ninurta battling monsters "almost aligned" with the values of a power-hungry society.  
Through an act of literary fusion, the neutral, formless water of the proto-myth was personified as the monstrous chaos-goddess Tiamat. The act of separation was no longer a peaceful ordering but a violent dismemberment of her corpse by the hero-god Marduk. This adaptation was not a radical invention but a clever recombination of familiar narrative elements that better reflected the tellers' hearts.  
This memetic evolution served a clear political purpose. By casting Marduk, the patron god of Babylon, as the victorious hero, the myth provided a divine charter for Babylon's imperial dominance. The story no longer just explained cosmic origins; it now legitimized a political reality built on conquest and control. The creation of humanity as slaves from the blood of a rebel god was the logical conclusion of this worldview, a perfect reflection of a society built on hierarchy and servitude. The *Enuma Elish* is the end product of a long evolutionary path where the proto-myth was incrementally adapted to perfectly align with a state of consciousness oriented toward power, conflict, and division.

## **IV. Trajectory A: The Evolution Toward Coherence and Love**

In parallel, the CDE hypothesis predicts that a collective consciousness guided by a "love of God and the neighbor" will evolve toward unifying principles of coherence, truth, and compassion. This creates a memetic environment that selects for stories reflecting these values.  
The authors of Genesis 1 were *bricoleurs* of this "heart of unity." Working with the same primordial matrix, their adaptation was not one of fusion with conflict myths, but of profound and deliberate purification. The narrative that "almost aligned" with their worldview was the ancient West Semitic tradition of a high creator god, El, a wise and benevolent patriarch who ruled from a distance.  
Armed with this orientation toward unity, the Israelite scribes approached the shared proto-myth and performed a series of precise, restorative adaptations:

* **The Taming of Chaos:** They retained the primordial water, the *tehom*, making a direct linguistic link to Tiamat, but deliberately stripped it of its personality and divine status. It was no longer a rival to be fought, but an inert substance to be ordered.  
* **The Subjugation of the Gods:** They took the elements that other cultures deified—the sun, moon, and stars—and pointedly re-categorized them as mere "creations," functional objects serving a higher purpose, not gods to be worshipped.  
* **Creation by Word, Not War:** The creative mechanism is not violent combat but serene, divine fiat. The effortless sequence of "And God said..." is a direct refutation of the conflict-driven narrative of Marduk.  
* **The Elevation of Humanity:** In a radical departure from the Mesopotamian view of humanity as slaves, Genesis declares that *all* humans, male and female, are created in the "image of God," democratizing a concept of divine representation that was elsewhere reserved exclusively for kings. This reflects a consciousness oriented toward universal dignity and mutual inclusivity.

The authors of Genesis saw the violent, polytheistic elements of myths like the *Enuma Elish* as corruptions of a purer, simpler truth. Their work was an act of restoration, adapting the shared proto-myth to align perfectly with a consciousness oriented toward a single, good, and loving source of all being.

## **V. The Evidentiary Foundation: Consciousness as a Fundamental Force**

The CDE hypothesis rests on a foundational claim: that consciousness is not merely an emergent property of the brain but is a fundamental, non-local force capable of persisting beyond physical death. This claim is a prerequisite for consciousness to act as a continuous driver of memetic evolution across generations. While this is a metaphysical claim, it is not without empirical support. The CDE framework builds its case on decades of systematic research into anomalous phenomena that challenge a purely materialist view of the mind.  
The primary "gold standard" of this evidence comes from the work of the University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) on children's past-life memories. For over 50 years, researchers have investigated more than 2,500 cases of young children, typically between the ages of two and four, who report spontaneous and often emotionally intense memories of a previous life. The strength of this data lies in a consistent pattern of features that are difficult to explain through conventional models:

* **Specific, Verifiable Details:** Children often provide numerous precise details about names, places, relationships, and the manner of death of a "previous personality." In many cases, these statements have been sufficient to identify a single deceased individual who uniquely matches the child's descriptions, often in a location unknown to the child's family.  
* **Physical and Behavioral Correlates:** In approximately 30% of cases, children are born with birthmarks or birth defects that precisely correspond to wounds, often fatal ones, sustained by the deceased person, as verified by autopsy reports and medical records. Many children also exhibit phobias and behaviors consistent with the previous life's mode of death or occupation.

A second line of evidence comes from research into Near-Death Experiences (NDEs). The CDE hypothesis notes the striking structural parallels between the classic NDE journey (leaving the body, traveling toward a light, entering another realm) and the "intermission memories" reported by about 20% of the children in the DOPS studies—memories of the time *between* lives.  
Crucially, the purpose of this data within the CDE framework is not to prove reincarnation as an evolutionary mechanism. Rather, its purpose is to "establish serious doubt in conventional naturalistic world views" by providing robust, scientifically scrutinized evidence for the persistence of consciousness beyond the brain. This evidence supports the hypothesis's core premise: that consciousness is a fundamental, continuous reality. It is this continuity that makes it plausible for consciousness—our true selves, in this life and beyond—to be the driving force behind the long-term evolution of our most cherished stories and values.

## **Conclusion: An Evolution of the Heart**

The proposition that creation stories evolve to reflect the state of consciousness of their tellers provides a powerful, unifying theory that resolves the apparent contradictions in the ancient record. The Consciousness-Driven Evolution hypothesis offers a scientific language for this process, framing it as a form of memetic evolution guided by the selective pressure of our deepest collective choices.  
The divergent paths of the *Enuma Elish* and Genesis 1 are not accidents of history. They are the predictable outcomes of two fundamental orientations of the human heart. One path, choosing power and self-interest, evolved a story of cosmic conflict that mirrored and legitimized its own divided state. The other path, choosing unity and love, evolved a story of serene, benevolent order that reflected its aspiration for a coherent and meaningful reality. The stories we tell are not just reflections of who we are; they are the very engines of who we are becoming, shaping the memetic niche that will, in turn, shape the consciousness of generations to come.
