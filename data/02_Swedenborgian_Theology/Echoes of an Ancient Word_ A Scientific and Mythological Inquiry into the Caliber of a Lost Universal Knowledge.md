## **Part I: Defining the Object of Inquiry — Swedenborg's "Ancient Word"**

The intellectual legacy of the 18th-century polymath Emanuel Swedenborg presents a compelling paradox. Celebrated as a pioneering scientist whose empirical investigations in fields from neuroscience to cosmology were centuries ahead of his time, Swedenborg dedicated the latter half of his life to a vast theological project seemingly predicated on an uncritical acceptance of biblical historicity. This report seeks to move beyond this apparent contradiction to frame Swedenborg's concept of a lost "Ancient Word" not as a matter of faith, but as a specific, structured hypothesis about the nature of ancient knowledge and its transmission—a hypothesis whose "caliber" can be explored through the lenses of modern scientific inquiry.

### **Swedenborg the Scientist and the Methodological Imperative**

To comprehend Swedenborg's theological framework, one must first appreciate the caliber of his scientific mind. He was a consummate "system thinker," a methodical and dispassionate analyst whose work in mapping the functions of the cerebral cortex, positing a form of the nebular hypothesis for the solar system's origin, and applying his engineering acumen to the Swedish mining industry demonstrated a profound ability to infer dynamic function from static structure. His decades-long scientific career was a single, focused research program with a metaphysical objective: to discover the "definite connection" between the material and spiritual worlds, to locate the physical "seat of the soul".  
When the empirical methods of natural philosophy proved insufficient for this task, Swedenborg did not abandon his systematic approach; he adopted a new methodology. His subsequent theological work was a continuation of his scientific project, but with a new source of data: the biblical text, which he termed "the Word". His acceptance of its literal historicity from the patriarchal narratives onward was not an intellectual blind spot but a methodological imperative. For his "Science of Correspondences"—the doctrine positing a systematic, law-like relationship between every physical object and a corresponding spiritual reality—to function as a science, it required a fixed, objective, and divinely authored "data set." Just as an anatomist requires a real body to discover the laws of physiology, Swedenborg required a real history to uncover the laws of spiritual reality. To question the historicity of this divine "specimen" would have been to invalidate the very premise of his investigation.

### **A Critical Distinction: "Made-Up History" vs. "Real History"**

Far from being a uniform literalist, Swedenborg applied a rigorous internal form of textual criticism, making a crucial distinction between two different types of narrative within the Pentateuch. This distinction is the foundation of the present inquiry.  
First, he identified the narratives of Genesis chapters 1-11 as fragments of a more ancient, now-lost scripture he called the **"Ancient Word"**. He explicitly stated that these stories—including the accounts of Creation, Adam and Eve, and the Flood—were **"made-up history."** They were pure allegories with "little, if any, historical relevance". In his analysis, the figures described were not historical individuals but representations of entire spiritual epochs or "churches." "Adam," for instance, represented not the first man but the first great spiritual culture of humanity. This classification demonstrates a clear capacity for non-literal, symbolic interpretation.  
Second, he argued that beginning with the call of Abram in Genesis 12, the nature of the Word fundamentally changes. These subsequent narratives, including the story of the Exodus, he classified as **"real history."** He asserted that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Israelite people were real, and the events described literally happened. However, these were not *mere* historical events. They were divinely chosen and orchestrated by Providence to serve as perfect, tangible *correspondences* for profound spiritual processes, such as the regeneration of the individual soul.  
By positing these two distinct forms of revelation—one ancient, universal, and purely allegorical, the other later, particular, and clothed in real history—Swedenborg inadvertently created a testable framework. He described a universal symbolic language or system of archetypes that predated the localized, historical myths of the Bronze and Iron Ages. This provides a clear set of characteristics to search for in the archaeological and anthropological record: evidence of a widespread, ancient, non-literal, symbolic system. The modern scientific inquiry, therefore, is not about validating Swedenborg's theology, but about investigating whether any evidence exists for a global, prehistoric symbolic system that predates and differs in character from the national myths of later civilizations.  
It is essential to situate Swedenborg in his 18th-century context. The modern evidentiary standards that now create a sense of paradox were entirely absent in his era. The disciplines of modern archaeology, geology, and historical-critical analysis, which provide the primary evidence for evaluating the historicity of the Exodus today, did not yet exist. His position was not a rejection of contrary evidence; that evidence simply had not been gathered. Within the context of the knowledge available to him, his approach was entirely rational.

## **Part II: Modern Lenses for Ancient Narratives — Bricolage vs. Consciousness**

To assess the potential for a concept of the "caliber" of an Ancient Word, it is necessary to first understand the modern theoretical frameworks through which the formation of ancient myths is analyzed. Two primary models emerge from the research: the "Mythic Bricolage" model, grounded in historical-materialism, and the "Consciousness-Driven Evolution" model, which proposes a paradigm-challenging, post-materialist perspective.

### **The "Mythic Bricolage" Model**

This model, derived from the work of anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, posits that ancient scribes acted as *bricoleurs*—craftsmen who assemble new structures not from virgin materials, but from the "remains and debris of events". Applied to the Exodus narrative, this framework suggests that Iron Age Israelite scribes were not inventing a story from scratch but were master editors, weaving together authentic but historically and chronologically disconnected "memory fragments" into a coherent national charter myth.  
The proposed fragments are rooted in real phenomena, but separated by centuries:

1. **The Memory of Cataclysm:** The ten plagues of Egypt are proposed to be based on a repurposed, free-floating "disaster myth"—a collective memory of the massive Thera volcanic eruption (c. 1600 BCE), which caused regional ecological chaos, darkness, and ashfall.  
2. **The Memory of Deliverance:** The parting of the Reed Sea is rooted in the memory of a rare but natural oceanographic phenomenon known as a "wind setdown," where sustained strong winds can temporarily expose the seabed of shallow lagoons.  
3. **The Memory of Liberation:** The central theme of freedom from bondage is grounded in the authentic historical experience of proto-Israelite groups gaining freedom from Egyptian imperial hegemony *in Canaan* during the systemic Late Bronze Age Collapse (c. 1200 BCE).

The driving force behind the fusion of these disparate memories is described as "narrative gravitation." Over centuries of oral transmission, the powerful, identity-defining theme of Slavery versus Freedom acted as a gravitational core, attracting and organizing these other potent but originally unrelated stories around itself. This process was shaped by the present-day identity needs of Iron Age Israel, which, in seeking to forge a cohesive identity, reconstructed its past to reinforce its foundational self-conception as a liberated people.

### **The "Consciousness-Driven Evolution" (CDE) Model**

This model offers a fundamentally different paradigm. It proposes that consciousness is not a passive byproduct of material processes but an active, driving force in *memetic* (cultural) evolution. The ideas and stories that define a civilization are selected for based on their resonance with the underlying orientation of the collective consciousness.  
At the heart of the CDE model is a polarity within consciousness, termed the "ruling love":

* **A Love of Self and the World:** An orientation toward power, control, and selfish gratification.  
* **A Love of God and the Neighbor:** An orientation toward wisdom, truth, and service to the collective good.

These two orientations create distinct selective pressures, pushing societies and their myths along opposing evolutionary trajectories from a common ancestor—a shared, neutral "proto-myth." This proto-myth, identifiable through comparative analysis of Ancient Near Eastern creation stories, contained simple, unadorned elements: a primordial watery chaos, the separation of realms, the emergence of land, and the creation of humanity from clay.

* **Trajectory B (e.g., *Enuma Elish*):** A collective consciousness oriented toward power and self-interest evolves the proto-myth by fusing it with "chaos-combat" myths. The neutral primordial water is personified as the monster Tiamat, creation becomes an act of violent dismemberment, and humanity is created as slaves to serve the gods. The resulting myth perfectly reflects and legitimizes a social order based on conflict, hierarchy, and power.  
* **Trajectory A (e.g., Genesis 1):** A collective consciousness oriented toward unity and love evolves the proto-myth through purification. The primordial water (*tehom*) is stripped of its personality, elements deified by other cultures (sun, moon) are demoted to mere creations, creation occurs by serene divine fiat ("And God said..."), and humanity is universally elevated as being made in the "image of God." The resulting myth reflects a worldview of coherence, benevolence, and universal dignity.

This model rests on the foundational premise that consciousness is a fundamental, non-local force capable of persisting beyond physical death, allowing it to act as a continuous driver of memetic evolution across generations. This premise, while metaphysical, is supported by a body of anomalous empirical data that challenges conventional materialist worldviews.

### **A Synthesis of Models**

These two frameworks, while seemingly contradictory, may not be mutually exclusive. They may, in fact, describe different stages of a single, larger process of myth formation. The CDE model posits a coherent, universal "proto-myth" as a starting point. A major global cataclysm—such as the Younger Dryas impact event, discussed later—could have shattered this unified narrative into the very "remains and debris of events" that the Bricolage model takes as its raw material. These fragmented memories of a world plunged into chaos would then become the powerful, free-floating stories available to later cultures. The Bricolage model would then expertly describe the *technical* process of how Iron Age scribes reassembled these fragments, while the CDE model would explain the *ideological* reason *why* they were assembled in a particular way—to reflect either a consciousness of conflict and power or one of unity and love. Together, they provide a more comprehensive explanation than either model can alone.

| Feature | Mythic Bricolage Model | Consciousness-Driven Evolution Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Underlying Axiom** | Materialism (mind emerges from matter) | Post-Materialism (consciousness is fundamental) |
| **Nature of Source Material** | Disconnected historical memory fragments | A single, coherent proto-myth |
| **Primary Agent of Change** | Human scribes/storytellers (*bricoleurs*) | Collective state of consciousness ("ruling love") |
| **Mechanism of Change** | Narrative gravitation & literary synthesis | Memetic selection based on resonance with consciousness |
| **Goal of the Myth** | To forge a national charter myth (political) | To reflect the internal state of the soul (spiritual) |
| **Relationship to History** | Uses distorted history as raw material | Reflects a history of consciousness, not events |

## **Part III: Scientific Indications of a "Word of Caliber"**

Moving from theoretical models to empirical evidence, this section examines three distinct streams of scientific inquiry that resonate with the "caliber" of a universal, ancient system of knowledge. These indications progress from an established transmission mechanism (oral tradition), to tangible archaeological evidence of a symbolic system (deep archaeology), to paradigm-challenging data on the nature of consciousness itself.

### **Indication I: The Echo of Deep Memory — The Durability of Oral Tradition**

A primary objection to the concept of an "Ancient Word" surviving from deep prehistory is the question of its transmission. Modern scholarship, however, has increasingly challenged the long-held assumption of the superiority and reliability of written records over oral ones. Research demonstrates that oral tradition is not simply rumor but a "dynamic and highly diverse oral-aural medium" for storing and transmitting knowledge, governed by systematic rules and performance contexts that can ensure high-fidelity retention over vast periods.

#### **Case Study 1: Australian Aboriginal Songlines**

Compelling evidence for the durability of oral tradition comes from Australian Aboriginal cultures. For millennia, they have preserved "songlines"—complex oral traditions that function as living maps, encoding vast amounts of information about navigation, resource availability, law, and cosmology directly into the features of the landscape. This research has yielded two astonishing findings:

* **Geological Memory:** Oral traditions from more than 30 locations around the Australian coast accurately describe coastal geographies and land bridges that were submerged by post-glacial sea-level rise between 7,000 and 12,000 years ago (Hamacher & Norris, 2011).  
* **Astronomical Memory:** Palawa traditions from Tasmania preserve an account of the star Canopus being near the southern celestial pole, a position it last held approximately 14,000 years ago (Hamacher & Norris, 2011).

The mechanism for this incredible fidelity is that memory is not stored solely in the brain but is distributed and encoded into the landscape itself. The stories, songs, and rituals are inextricably linked to physical places, creating a massive, resilient, and non-written repository of knowledge.

#### **Case Study 2: The Klamath Memory of Mount Mazama**

A second powerful example comes from the Klamath people of North America. Their oral tradition preserves a precise and detailed account of the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Mazama and the subsequent formation of Crater Lake, an event geologists have dated to approximately 7,700 years ago. When the oral narrative is placed alongside the modern geological account, the sequence of events shows a "striking agreement": both describe a tall mountain prone to minor eruptions, followed by a titanic opening blast, the ejection of "red-hot rocks" and burning ash that devastated the landscape, the collapse of the mountain's summit, and the final filling of the resulting caldera with water. This demonstrates that memory of a singular, traumatic geological event can be preserved with remarkable accuracy for millennia.

#### **The "Memory Code" Hypothesis**

Researcher Lynne Kelly provides a powerful, unifying theory that connects these observations to the global archaeological record. In her work, she proposes that many enigmatic ancient monuments—such as Stonehenge, the statues of Easter Island, and the great houses of the American Southwest—were not merely ceremonial sites but sophisticated mnemonic devices. They functioned as physical "memory palaces," tangible structures used by oral cultures to encode encyclopedic knowledge about their world. This hypothesis suggests a tangible technology for preserving an "Ancient Word."  
These lines of evidence suggest that Swedenborg's concept of an "Ancient Word" may not refer to a lost text, but rather to a preserved cultural memory of a lost *cognitive technology*. The systems described by Kelly and observed in Aboriginal culture are precisely what Swedenborg described: allegorical, symbolic, place-based systems for encoding knowledge, not linear histories. The great historical transition from a nomadic life, where knowledge is encoded in the natural landscape (songlines), to a settled agricultural life, where it must be encoded in man-made monuments (Stonehenge), marks a major cognitive shift. The subsequent invention of writing externalized memory completely, favoring abstract, linear thought. It is plausible that Swedenborg's distinction between the purely allegorical "Ancient Word" and the later, historical "Hebrew Word" is a preserved echo of this real, profound transition in human cognitive technology.

### **Indication II: The Echo of Deep Symbolism — A Lost Universal Grammar?**

If a mechanism for long-term transmission exists, the next question concerns the *content*. Is there archaeological evidence for a coherent, widespread, and ancient symbolic system that could represent a potential "Ancient Word"? Recent discoveries and analyses suggest the answer may be yes.

#### **Göbekli Tepe: A Message in Stone from 12,000 Years Ago**

The discovery of Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey has revolutionized our understanding of the Neolithic period. Dated to c. 9600 BCE, it consists of monumental circular enclosures built around massive, T-shaped limestone pillars, intricately carved with a complex iconography of animals. This was achieved by hunter-gatherers, thousands of years before the invention of pottery, writing, or agriculture. The animal reliefs are not random decorations; they appear to have emblematic significance, with different species (snakes, foxes, boars, birds) dominating the iconography of different enclosures, possibly representing different social groups or totems.  
A particularly provocative interpretation comes from the field of archaeoastronomy. Researchers Martin Sweatman and Dimitrios Tsikritsis have proposed that the famous "Vulture Stone" (Pillar 43\) is a sophisticated "date stamp." They argue that the animal carvings on the pillar correspond to astronomical constellations and that their arrangement records the date of a cataclysmic event: the cometary impact believed to have initiated the Younger Dryas mini-ice age, around 10,950 BCE. This theory implies that these pre-agricultural people possessed a highly advanced, shared system of astronomical knowledge.

> **[INTERPRETATION #16]** This section treats Pillar 43 primarily as a “date stamp” / zodiac-calendar artifact. Current reading treats Pillar 43 as a crisis-management diagram of the Neolithic transition: Scorpion = sensual persuasion, Headless Man = severed will/understanding, Vulture = intellect preserving Divine Truth; the “Stone Library” externalizes what internal perception could no longer sustain.

#### **Paleolithic Cave Art: A Unified Symbolic System**

This evidence for a sophisticated symbolic system in the early Neolithic is complemented by research into the preceding Paleolithic period. Paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger undertook a massive project to catalogue the non-figurative, geometric signs in European Ice Age caves. Her key finding was astonishing: a mere **32 geometric signs** are used repeatedly across the entire European continent for a period of 30,000 years, from roughly 40,000 to 10,000 years before the present (von Petzinger, 2016).  
The most profound implication of this discovery is that this symbolic toolkit was not invented in Europe. Von Petzinger's analysis shows that two-thirds of these signs were already in use when *Homo sapiens* first arrived on the continent, suggesting they brought this system with them **out of Africa**. This points directly to the possibility of a universal symbolic inheritance, a graphic language shared by our most distant ancestors.

#### **The Grand Synthesis: A 40,000-Year-Old Zodiac?**

A radical hypothesis by Sweatman and Alistair Coombs connects these two streams of evidence. They propose that the animal symbols found in Paleolithic caves across Europe and the symbols at Göbekli Tepe are part of the *very same ancient zodiacal system*. They argue this system was used consistently for millennia to record dates and astronomical events by tracking the precession of the equinoxes. If correct, this theory suggests a single, continuous system of advanced astronomical knowledge, encoded in a shared symbolic language, that stretches from at least 40,000 years ago through the dawn of the Neolithic. This represents perhaps the strongest scientific argument for a concept of the "caliber" of an Ancient Word.  
These disparate data streams converge on a single, pivotal moment in deep history: the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch, around 12,000 years ago. The long-standing Paleolithic symbolic tradition appears to culminate in the sophisticated astronomical system used at Göbekli Tepe to specifically date and memorialize the Younger Dryas cataclysm. This same period corresponds to the profound environmental trauma of rapid sea-level rise, an event so powerful its memory was preserved for millennia in oral traditions. It is therefore plausible that a global cataclysm acted as a powerful selective pressure, forcing a pre-existing symbolic and astronomical system—a form of "Ancient Word"—to be recorded in a monumental and durable form (Göbekli Tepe) for the first time. The trauma of this event ensured its memory was preserved, both in stone and in the oral traditions that may form the basis of the "proto-myth" of world destruction and renewal found in so many later cultures.

| Phenomenon | Estimated Date (BP) | Key Characteristics |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Paleolithic Symbolic System** | \~40,000 \- 10,000 | 32 recurring geometric signs across Europe, possibly originating in Africa. |
| **Younger Dryas Impact Event** | \~12,800 | Proposed cometary impact causing global cataclysm, megafaunal extinction, and mini-ice age. |
| **End of Glacial Sea-Level Rise** | \~12,000 \- 7,000 | Inundation of coastal lands, an event preserved in Aboriginal oral tradition. |
| **Göbekli Tepe Construction** | \~11,600 | First monumental architecture, complex symbolism, potential astronomical observatory memorializing the YD impact. |

### **Indication III: The Echo of Deep Consciousness — Challenging Materialist Paradigms**

The final line of inquiry engages directly with paradigm-challenging science, examining empirical data that suggests consciousness may not be an emergent property of the brain but a more fundamental aspect of reality. This provides a speculative, yet scientifically grounded, framework for understanding both the CDE model of myth and a potential alternative mechanism for the transmission of deep-time memory. The persistence of the "hard problem of consciousness"—the question of how subjective experience arises from physical matter—has led some researchers to propose that post-materialist models, which consider consciousness to be fundamental or non-local, are necessary to break the conceptual impasse.

#### **Evidence Stream 1: Children's Past-Life Memories (UVA DOPS)**

Since 1967, the Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) at the University of Virginia has conducted rigorous scientific investigations into phenomena suggesting the survival of consciousness after death. Their primary focus has been on over 2,500 cases of young children, typically between the ages of two and four, who spontaneously report memories of a previous life. The strength of this data lies in a consistent pattern of features that are difficult to explain through conventional models :

* **Specific, Verifiable Details:** Children often provide numerous precise details about names, places, and the manner of death of a "previous personality," which in many cases have been sufficient to identify a single deceased individual who uniquely matches the child's descriptions.  
* **Physical Correlates:** In approximately 30% of cases, children are born with birthmarks or birth defects that precisely correspond to wounds, often fatal ones, sustained by the deceased person, as verified by autopsy reports and medical records.

While researchers like Ian Stevenson considered alternative explanations such as fraud, cryptomnesia (hidden memory), and cultural artifacts, they concluded that in the strongest cases, these conventional explanations were insufficient.

#### **Evidence Stream 2: Veridical Perception in Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)**

Research into Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)—profound experiences reported by individuals close to death—provides another line of challenging data. While common features include passing through a tunnel, seeing a light, and a life review, the most scientifically significant aspect is that of *veridical NDEs*. In these cases, experiencers report acquiring verifiable information—such as observing events in a distant room or details of their own resuscitation—while in a state of clinical death or deep unconsciousness, with no measurable brain activity. These accounts directly challenge the axiom that consciousness is wholly dependent on a functioning brain.

#### **Evidence Stream 3: Remote Viewing (RV)**

Remote viewing is the purported ability to acquire information about a distant or unseen target using only the mind. While widely regarded as pseudoscience by the mainstream scientific community, it has been the subject of government-sponsored research, most famously the declassified Stargate Project. A retrospective evaluation of this program yielded conflicting results: one reviewer, Jessica Utts, found a small but statistically significant effect above chance, while the other, Ray Hyman, remained unconvinced, citing methodological flaws. More recent meta-analyses of the full body of remote viewing research have also claimed to find a small but persistent statistical anomaly that eludes conventional explanation.  
If taken at face value, this body of anomalous data provides empirical support for the foundational premise of the CDE model: that consciousness may be a continuous, non-local reality. The research on children's past-life memories specifically suggests that *memory* and, crucially, *trauma* can be carried across lives. This opens a speculative but coherent possibility for a metaphysical mechanism of transmission. The Younger Dryas event was a profound global trauma. Within this post-materialist framework, the memory of this foundational cataclysm might not only be transmitted culturally through songlines and monuments, but also *trans-personally*, imprinted on consciousness itself. This could provide a deeper explanation for the profound, archetypal power of flood and world-destruction myths—they may not just be stories being told, but deep memories being re-experienced.

| Phenomenon | Key Research Body | Core Finding | Proposed Implication for Consciousness | Primary Critiques |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Children's Past-Life Memories** | UVA DOPS | Verifiable statements & birthmark correlations | Memory/trauma can persist beyond death | Cultural artifact, fraud, cryptomnesia |
| **Veridical NDEs** | Various (e.g., Greyson at UVA) | Perception during clinical death | Consciousness is not brain-dependent | Hallucination, faulty memory reconstruction |
| **Remote Viewing** | SRI, SAIC (Stargate Project) | Small, statistically significant effect above chance | Information can be accessed non-locally | Pseudoscience, flawed protocols, sensory leakage |

## **Part IV: Synthesis and Conclusion — A New Context for an Old Idea**

This inquiry began with an 18th-century theological concept—Emanuel Swedenborg's "Ancient Word"—and has traversed millennia of human history and the frontiers of modern science. The goal was not to validate a specific doctrine, but to explore whether scientific inquiry could reveal evidence for a lost system of knowledge of a similar "caliber." The journey from Swedenborg's textual analysis to the data streams of oral tradition, deep archaeology, and consciousness research allows for the construction of a new, multi-layered context for this old idea.  
The "Ancient Word," reinterpreted through this modern lens, ceases to be a lost book. Instead, it emerges as a plausible convergence of three real, observable, and interconnected phenomena:

1. **A Cognitive Technology:** The pre-literate, place-based mnemonic system—the "Memory Code"—that was humanity's primary method for storing and transmitting encyclopedic knowledge for tens of thousands of years. This system was allegorical, symbolic, and tied to landscape and ritual, matching the characteristics Swedenborg ascribed to his "Ancient Word".  
2. **A Body of Knowledge:** A coherent symbolic and astronomical system, with potential origins in the African Paleolithic, which appears to have been used continuously for over 30,000 years. This system was capable of sophisticated astronomical observation and was used at sites like Göbekli Tepe to record and memorialize a foundational cataclysm at the dawn of our current geological epoch.  
3. **A Mode of Consciousness:** A potential non-local aspect of consciousness, suggested by decades of anomalous empirical data, that may allow for the trans-personal transmission of archetypal memories and traumas. This provides a speculative but profound deeper layer to cultural inheritance, suggesting that our most foundational myths may be rooted not only in stories told but in traumas experienced by consciousness itself.

From this perspective, the "loss" of the Ancient Word was not a historical accident but an inevitable consequence of the profound cognitive shifts that defined human history. The agricultural revolution necessitated a transition from encoding knowledge in the natural landscape to encoding it in man-made monuments. The later invention of writing completed this process, externalizing memory, favoring linear and abstract thought, and ultimately severing the direct, embodied link between knowledge, landscape, and ritual performance. In this transition, the holistic, allegorical "Word" was fragmented, giving way to the localized, historicized, and textual narratives of later civilizations.  
This entire synthesis is, itself, an act of modern intellectual *bricolage*, piecing together ancient myths and modern scientific data to construct a new explanatory narrative. It does not—and cannot—"prove" the existence of Swedenborg's Ancient Word. However, it demonstrates that scientific inquiry, when pursued with a critical and open mind across disciplines, reveals profound echoes of deep memory, deep symbolism, and deep consciousness. These echoes resonate powerfully with the *caliber* of Swedenborg's visionary idea, suggesting that our ancient ancestors may have possessed a system of knowledge—a way of knowing—whose sophistication and endurance we are only just beginning to appreciate.
